		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Raad al-Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15786&LangID=E">reported</a> [press release] Wednesday that retreating <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501">Boko Haram</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Boko+haram">news archive</a>] militants in Nigeria have been murdering woman and girls previously taken captive by the group. Before a special session of the UN Human Rights Council, the commissioner relayed reports "that Boko Haram fighters who were retreating from the advance of the joint forces murdered their so-called "wives";in fact, women and girls held in slavery; and other captives as Government troops advanced." The UN human rights chief called on international community to combat human rights abuses in the region, noting the importance of upholding "the values of democracy and human rights" in combating violent extremism. In addition to condemning the actions of Boko Haram, Zeid acknowledged allegations that security forces of Nigeria and coalition nations fighting Boko Haram have also perpetrated human rights violations against specific religious and ethnic groups. </p>

<p>A coalition of African nations has in recent months successfully combated Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. Last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-boko-haram-has-killed-more-than-1000-civilians-in-2015.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed so far in 2015 at the hands of Boko Haram. In January the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-security-council-condemns-boko-haram-attacks.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria and called for an end to terrorist attacks and release of abducted child soldiers. Also in January <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-releases-satellite-images-of-nigeria-attacks.php">released satellite images</a> [AI asset bank] that allegedly show the destruction of more than 3,700 buildings in the Nigerian towns of Baga and Doron Baga by Boko Haram militants. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Palestine became the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1103.aspx">123rd state party</a> [press release] to the Rome Statute Wednesday, officially joining the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The Rome Statute of the ICC was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/palestinian-president-signs-papers-to-join-icc.php">signed and submitted</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.president.ps/eng/officialresume.aspx">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas</a> [official profile] in January. A ceremony Wednesday included many ICC officials, judges, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Palestine, Dr. Riad Al-Malki. Al-Malki stated in regards to Palestine joining the ICC, "[a]s Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice. Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Palestine could now pursue an ICC complaint against Israel for war crimes, but only ICC prosecutors and judges can decide what cases will be pursued.</p>

<p>The conflict between <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel">Israel</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=palestine">Palestine</a> [JURIST news archive] has lasted for years and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7812290.stm">caused</a> [BBC timeline] numerous casualties on both sides. In January the Israel Law Center filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/israel-based-rights-group-files-war-crimes-complaint-with-icc-against-palestinians.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ICC, accusing Palestinian leaders of war crimes including torture, terrorism and civil rights violations. In December <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] declared that Israel's <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/amnesty-israel-attacks-on-gaza-landmark-buildings-were-war-crimes.php">air strikes</a> [JURIST report] on landmark buildings in Gaza were deliberate war crimes that led to the injury of many civilians. In September the Israel Law Center asked the ICC to open an <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into war crimes allegedly committed by Hamas leader, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20623504">Khaled Meshaal</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">Arkansas House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Tuesday approved a controversial <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2015/2015R/Bills/HB1228.pdf">bill</a> [HB 1228, PDF] intended to protect religious freedoms of businesses.Those supporting the Republican-backed bill say it will protect religious freedoms for businesses, and those opposed say that businesses may be allowed to go too far with the law and refuse service to homosexuals. The bill states that "governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification." Criticism of the bill has spread across the country with local business giants <a href="http://corporate.walmart.com/">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate websites] voicing their opposition. A Walmart spokesperson stated, "[t]oday's passage of HB1228 threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold." Arkansas <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/">Governor Asa Hutchinson</a> [official website] said Wednesday that he will not sign the bill as is and will ask the legislature to make certain changes to mirror federal law.</p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights remain controversial throughout the US. Last week the Indiana Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to a similar "religious freedom" bill, generating controversy across the nation. Earlier this month Utah lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-lawmakers-unveil-lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill.php">unveiled legislation</a> [JURIST report] that aims to balance religious rights and protections against LGBT discrimination in the workplace and housing. In February Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arkansas-bill-prohibiting-local-anti-discrimination-ordinances-becomes-law.php">enacted a bill</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits cities and local governments from establishing ordinances with anti-discrimination codes. Also in February Kansas Governor Sam Brownback <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/kansas-governor-rescinds-executive-order-protecting-lgbt-employees.php">rescinded</a> [JURIST report] a number of executive orders by the former governor, including one that protected LGBT state employees from unfair hiring practices, sexual harassment and other types of discrimination at work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military court in Thailand Tuesday sentenced a businessman to 25 years in prison for posting messages critical of the Thai royal family on Facebook. Theinsutham Suthijittaseranee was <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b1b18141cb3649ecbf9f2ab5acc30742/thai-court-gives-25-year-jail-sentence-defaming-monarchy">found guilty</a> [AP report] of five counts of of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29628191"><em>lèse majesté</em></a> [BBC backgrounder], with each count garnering a 10-year sentence. The sentence was reduced by half as a result of Thiensutham pleading guilty to the charges. Thailand is home to one of the strictest <em>lèse majesté</em> laws in the world. <a href="http://www.samuiforsale.com/law-texts/thailand-penal-code.html#106">Article 112</a> [text] of Thailand's criminal code states that anyone who "defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." Following a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27517591">military coup</a> [BBC report] last May, the military government decreed that all cases involving <em>lèse majesté</em> allegations would be tried before a military court. The sentence has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/03/thailand-preposterous-25-year-prison-sentence-for-criticizing-royal-family/">harsh criticism</a> [AI report] from human rights groups, which have called for the <em>lèse majesté</em> law to be repealed or changed to better comply with human rights.</p>

<p>The military government put in place following the May 2014 coup has been criticized by world leaders for disregarding human rights. Earlier this week Thailand's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/thailand-pm-seeks-to-end-maritial-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to revoke the country's long-standing <a href="http://www.thailawforum.com/laws/Martial%20Law.pdf">Martial Law Act BE 2457 (1914)</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/thailand-pm-speaks-of-easing-martial-law.php">report</a>], calling on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8267080.stm">King Bhumibol Adulyadej</a> [BBC backgrounder] for approval. In March the Bangkok Military Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/thai-man-sentenced-to-18-months-under-lese-majeste-laws.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 67-year-old Opas Chansuksai to 18 months in prison for insulting the monarchy under the nation's <em>lèse majesté</em> laws. In August the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-human-rights-office-claims-thailand-laws-limit-free-expression.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that the prosecution and sentencing of <em>lese majeste</em> cases by Thailand's ruling military junta threaten citizens' rights of free expression. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] has sparked major international concern.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was an "alarming rise" in death sentences around the world in 2014, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/36892/">reported</a> [text] Tuesday. AI said there has been a 28 percent rise in death sentences from 2013&#8212;at least 2,466 compared to 1,925&#8212; and that an increased number of countries used capital punishment to deter crime, terrorism and domestic instability. AI reports that this spike in death sentences is largely due to Egypt and Nigeria, where there have been mass sentencings due to internal conflict and political instability. China again ranked as the top executioner in the world, carrying out more executions than the rest of the world combined. The other countries making up the world's top five executioners in 2014 were Iran (289 officially announced and at least 454 more that were not acknowledged by the authorities), Saudi Arabia (at least 90), Iraq (at least 61) and the US (35). Although the number of death sentences greatly increased in 2014, AI also reported the there were fewer executions than the year before and that several countries took positive steps towards banning the death penalty altogether.</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] remains a controversial issue all over the world. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed a bill to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">restore the firing squad</a> [JURIST report] as a method of execution, making Utah the only US state with the option. Also in March the Alabama House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/alabama-votes-to-keep-execution-drug-suppliers-secret-bring-back-electric-chair.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to bring back the use of the electric chair when chemicals for lethal injection are not available. Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-authorities-execute-12-after-six-year-moratorium-lifted.php">hanged</a> [JURIST report] 12 men in one day in March, the largest number of people executed in a single day following the preliminary removal of the country's moratorium on executions in December. In January a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia as punishment for drug-related crimes. In November China's highest court, the <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">the Supreme People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/china-high-court-to-investigate-ways-to-reduce-death-penalty-crimes.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] ways of reducing death penalty crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.mpas.org/sites/default/files/mdoc-complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], filed in the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website], identifies problems such as a lack of interpreters at the facility, limited access to hearing aids and difficulty in participating in educational opportunities. The prisoners also feel that outdated technology hinders their ability to communicate with family members while incarcerated. The agency asserts that the unfair treatment and discrimination against deaf and hard of hearing prisoners is a violation of federal law and the US Constitution.</p>

<p>Protecting <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prisoner+rights">prisoners' rights</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] are widely debated issues in the US and abroad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CEDAW/Pages/CEDAWIndex.aspx">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15781&LangID=E">urged Tanzania</a> [press release] to enforce its international obligations to prevent discrimination against women. The call comes after two women brought suit arguing that customary laws enforced in their communities contravened Tanzania's <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/downloads/constitution.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF] and its obligations under the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx">Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</a> (CEDAW) [official website], which it ratified in 1985. Although the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44:high-court-of-tanzania&catid=14:the-judiciary&Itemid=67">High Court of Tanzania</a> [official website] in 2006 agreed with the women that the customary law was discriminatory, because customary law is enforced in 30 districts in Tanzania, to rule in their favor would "open a Pandora's box" to challenge the customs of more than 120 tribes. The committee concluded by reminding Tanzania that its obligations under CEDAW supersede inconsistent and discriminatory provisions of tribal law. The committee has granted Tanzania six months to respond to its findings.</p>

<p>In spite of international efforts to <a href="/dateline/2015/01/anjelica-violi-educating-men.php">educate communities</a> [JURIST op-ed] and protect women's rights to be free from discrimination and violence, these efforts have been met with resistance and noncompliance. In February the UN reported that girls in at least 70 countries have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">attacked for seeking education</a> [JURIST report]. In January Amnesty International reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-egypt-failing-to-protect-women-from-violence.php">Egyptian government is failing to protect women's rights</a> [JURIST report] and end violence against women, stating that women and girls face violence in all aspects of life, including in public and at home. In December a Saudi Arabian court ordered the criminal cases against two women for driving, which is customarily banned in Saudi Arabia, be <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/saudi-arabia-women-activists-arrested-for-driving-transferred-to-terrorism-tribunal.php">held over to a special tribunal for terrorism</a> [JURIST report]. Also in December UN special Rapporteur on violence against women Rashida Manjoo called for the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-expert-urges-international-accountability-standards-for-violence-against-women.php">adopt legally binding agreements</a> [JURIST report] at the national level in order to fight violence against women in member states and hold violators accountable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard oral arguments Wednesday in two bankruptcy cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-400_o759.pdf">Harris v. Viegelahn</a> [transcript, PDF] the court must decide "whether, when a debtor in good faith converts a bankruptcy case to Chapter 7 after confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan, undistributed funds held by the former Chapter 13 trustee are refunded to the debtor or distributed to creditors." The dispute <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/03/argument-preview-court-to-take-on-undistributed-funds-and-bankruptcy-conversion/">involves</a> [SCOTUSblog report] the conversion of the two main forms of bankruptcy relief. Petitioner Charles Harris, after filing a voluntary petition for <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter13.aspx">Chapter 13</a> bankruptcy and continuing to pay under that plan for about a year, exercised his right to convert his case to <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter7.aspx">Chapter 7</a> [materials]. While the conversion terminated the service of the Chapter 13 trustee, the former Chapter 13 trustee still held more than $4,300 of Harris' wages that had been reserved for his mortgage lender and distributed those funds to his other creditors. In response, Harris moved to compel the refund of this money. While the motion was granted by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court, it was ultimately reversed by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], which held that the former trustee was authorized to distribute the post-petition wages despite the conversion. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-116_c1o2.pdf">Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank</a> [transcript, PDF], the court must consider whether an order denying confirmation of a debtor's Chapter 13 plan is final within the meaning of 28 USC §158 and is therefore immediately appealable by the debtor. In this case, petitioner Louis Bullard <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/14-116">filed</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] for Chapter 13 bankruptcy after the value of a property he financed through a mortgage with Blue Hills Bank fell lower than the mortgage he owed. Bullard submitted an amended hybrid plan to the bankruptcy court in 2012, citing the drop in property value below the worth of the mortgage. The court denied confirmation of the plan, stating that it was improper under applicable statutes and ordering him to file a new amended plan. Bullard appealed the denial to the Bankruptcy Court for the First Circuit, which denied the appeal and confirmed the judgement of the lower court. An appeal was then taken to the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website]. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that it did not have jurisdiction over the case because the denial of the proposed plan was not final. The issue of whether such a denial should be considered final is a matter of contention throughout the circuit courts, though the decision made by the First Circuit Court represents the majority approach. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thai <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="http://www.thaigov.go.th/en/government-en1/item/91045-91045.html">announced</a> [press release] Wednesday that the country's military government will lift martial law in place since May and replace it with a new security order. The new order has garnered significant criticism to the almost unlimited power granted to the already powerful Thai military. Article 44 of the <a href="http://lawdrafter.blogspot.com/2014/07/translation-of-constitution-of-kingdom.html">interim constitution</a> [text], which will replace martial law, allows the prime minister to issue executive orders to "disrupt or suppress" threats to national security. If an incident is to occur, under the new order, military personnel are allowed to apprehend those involved without an arrest warrant. The Thai military government has promised democratization in late 2015 through holding elections but the government has continuously jailed and censored the media coverage of the issue.</p>

<p>Thailand has experienced great upheaval since last year's military coup of. On May 20 Thailand's armed forces, led by then-General Prayuth, <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-armed-forces-impose-martial-law.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] and began a regime of censorship. Two days later the military proceeded to <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">take control</a> [JURIST report] of the country and suspend the constitution. The governmental control was followed by the replacement of civilian courts with military tribunals. The military saw themselves validated in late July when the king <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/thailand-king-endorses-interim-constitution.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] for the interim constitution. However, Thailand's armed forces has faced resistance from the international community and the Thai people themselves. In August the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] spoke out against Thailand's prosecution and sentencing <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-human-rights-office-claims-thailand-laws-limit-free-expression.php">practices as a threat</a> [JURIST report] to the right of free expression. In September, a group of Thai human rights activists <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] the country's martial law and called for it to end.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indiana's Republican legislative leaders announced Thursday that they are proposing an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1699997-read-the-updated-indiana-religious-freedom.html">amendment</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/101">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text] in an attempt to remedy the perception that the act permits discrimination based on sexual orientation. State Senate President Pro Tem <a href="http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/index.php?src=directory&view=senators&srctype=detail&refno=42&category=Leadership">David Long</a> and House Speaker <a href="http://www.indianahouserepublicans.com/members/leadership/brian-bosma/?back=members">Brian Bosma</a> [official profiles] will introduce the proposal, which bars service providers from using the act as a defense against accusations of discrimination and explicitly bars discrimination based on race, religion, age, national origin, disability or US military service. A conference committee will review the act once it is introduced, and both the House and Senate must approve the amendment before it can reach <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/">Governor Mike Pence</a> [official website] to be signed or rejected. </p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, as well as freedom of religious practice, remain controversial issues in the US. Nineteen states have enacted some variety of religious freedom laws, most modeled after the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993. At the time, Clinton <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/us/clinton-signs-law-protecting-religious-practices.html">stated</a> [NYT report] that the law subjects the federal government to "a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion." Pence signed Indiana's version into law after the state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill by a 40-10 vote. Proponents of the bill, such as Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor Daniel O. Conkle <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">argue</a> [text] that it "protect[s] religious believers of all faiths by granting them precisely the same consideration [as the federal law.]" The bill's strong opposition, however, argues that the law and those like it undermine the American spirit of inclusion. The considerable backlash from the Indiana bill is likely the reason Arkansas <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/">Governor Asa Hutchinson</a> [official website] declined to sign into law a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/arkansas-house-approves-religious-freedom-bill.php">similar bill</a> [JURIST report] in his state until the state lawmakers bring it more into line with the federal bill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] on Thursday released its <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15797&LangID=E">observational findings</a> [press release] on <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/RUS/CCPR_C_RUS_CO_7_19979_E.doc">human rights abuses in Russia</a> [text], concluding that Russia must repeal laws that limit free speech and permit discrimination based on sexual orientation and race. The report noted significant violations of the 1976 <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx"> International Convention on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], as well as strong manifestations of racism, xenophobia and homophobia that must be addressed and remedied by government officials. The report explicitly stated that laws signed by <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] restricting the work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and like groups and pervasive "patriarchal attitudes" limiting female participation in government appear to violate the Convention. </p>

<p>Russia has been the subject of a great deal of criticism over the last few years. Last week Putin <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/russia-president-signs-treaty-integrating-south-ossetia-breakaway-region.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a treaty to tighten control over the South Ossetia breakaway region. The treaty calls for full integration of the South Ossetia economy and military into Russia's. Earlier in March EU officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to stand by their policy of not recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea. Also that month Russian liberal political activist Boris Nemtsov was shot in the back four times in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine, and many believe Putin <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/two-charged-five-detained-for-murder-of-russia-former-deputy-pm.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the killing. In February US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/john-kerry-says-us-considering-new-sanctions-against-russia.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Washington is considering "additional sanctions" against Russia in light of the most recent events in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website, in Hebrew] blocked a controversial government proposal on Thursday to extend the West Bank separation barrier through the historic Cremisan valley. Israel has been building the barrier to prevent Palestinian attacks in Israel. The <a href="http://www.mod.gov.il/Pages/default.aspx">Israeli Defense Ministry</a> [official website, in Hebrew] had <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article17191073.html">planned to extend</a> [AP report] the wall through Palestinian farmlands, which would also divide Vatican land between a Roman Catholic monastery and a convent school. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/israels-top-court-blocks-extension-of-separation-wall-through-cremisan-valley">Under the rejected plan</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], the school would have been on the Palestinian side of the wall, meaning the children would have had to cross a military checkpoint to get to school. The monastery, convent and Palestinian landowners urged officials to build the wall closer to Jerusalem to save the valley, appealing directly to Pope Francis. The court ordered that the government find a less disruptive route for the barrier.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/israel-palestine">Israel-Palestine conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] continues to be a significant international legal issue. In November the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-body-urges-israel-to-investigate-alleged-war-crimes.php">urged Israel to investigate</a> [JURIST report] alleged violations committed by its forces during the recent conflict in Gaza. The 2014 conflict lasted from July 8 to August 26, resulting in more than 100,000 buildings damaged and nearly 2,200 deaths, with a high quantity of civilian casualties. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes-in-gaza.php">accused the Israeli military of committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report] by attacking schools where hundreds of displaced Palestinians sought shelter. Also in September the Shurat HaDin of the Israel Law Center <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">asked the International Criminal Court to open an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged war crimes committed by Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military court in Gambia secretly sentenced three soldiers to death on Monday for an attempted coup d'état, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/gambia-soldiers-sentenced-to-death-in-secret-trial-must-not-be-executed/">reported</a> [press release] Wednesday. Three other soldiers were sentenced to life in prison. All media was banned from observing the proceedings. AI claims the death sentences are a violation of the right to a fair trial and the right to life. "Gambia's justice system is deeply flawed and we have concerns about the fairness of the trial, given that it was held in secret," Stephen Cockburn, AI Deputy Regional Director for West and Central Africa, said. AI urged that the sentences be commuted to a term in prison and called for a new trial. The failed attempt to oust <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24383225">President Yahya Jammeh</a> [BBC profile] took place on December 30 of last year. Jammeh took power in a coup 20 years ago.</p>

<p>In January two men were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/two-men-charged-in-us-in-gambia-coup-attempt.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in the US with conspiring to help overthrow the Gambian government. On December 30 <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30642157">gunfire erupted</a> [BBC report] near the presidential palace in Banjul, leaving four killed. Later that week UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/index.asp">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-sg-urges-respect-for-rule-of-law-following-gambia-coup-attempt.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] "principled condemnation" of the attempted coup, urging respect for the rule of law. In November the UN also <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-chief-condemns-gambia-for-anti-gay-legislation.php">criticized Gambia</a> [JURIST report] for its passage and enforcement of legislation criminalizing homosexual acts. In September Gambian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/gambia-lawmakers-pass-bill-of-life-imprisonment-for-homosexual-acts.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] imposing life imprisonment for some homosexual acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">expressed alarm</a> [press release] Thursday over the Thai government's decision to replace martial law with a new security order. On Wednesday Thai <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-pm-announces-end-to-martial-law-after-10-months.php">military government would lift martial law</a> [JURIST report] and replace it with Article 44 of Thailand's <a href="http://lawdrafter.blogspot.com/2014/07/translation-of-constitution-of-kingdom.html">interim constitution</a> [text]. Zeid said the move is "really very worrying because it could lead to quite wide-scale human rights violations with total impunity and gives quite extraordinary powers even to junior military officers in their dealing with civilians." The imposition of Article 44 permits Chan-ocha to issue any legislative, executive or judicial order. According to Zeid, the order may annihilate freedom of expression. Moreover, violations of human rights under national and international laws would be legal and "peace and order maintenance officers" could be provided with immunity from both criminal and civil liabiliy. </p>

<p>Thailand has undergone political turmoil since the military coup last May when the country's armed forces <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-armed-forces-impose-martial-law.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on a military run television station, citing Thailand's martial law act of 1914 as the basis for the military's action. Just two days later, Chan-ocha announced that the military had seized control of the country and <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">suspended its constitution</a> [JURIST report]. In July Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/thailand-king-endorses-interim-constitution.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] for the interim constitution even though the international community expressed concern. In September a group of Thai human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">activists denounced</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to the country's state of martial law, accusing the ruling militia of imposing a judicial "twilight zone."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Hundreds of individuals on Wednesday filed <a href="/paperchase/JHU_Complaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] for medical malpractice against <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> [university website] for its role in government medical experiments that took place in Guatemala in the 1940s and 50s. During this time, individuals were deliberately infected with venereal diseases, including syphilis and gonorrhea, without their consent. The individuals were told that they were undergoing "routine medical tests" and that the medication they were being administered was "for their own good." The experiments were allegedly targeted at "children, soldiers, prison inmates, psychiatric hospital patients, and orphans." The suit was filed on behalf of 774 former research subjects and their families and seeks $1 billion in damages. According to the complaint, officials at Johns Hopkins had "substantial influence" over the studies, including advising the federal government on how to spend research funds. Specifically, it alleges that Johns Hopkins, along with other named defendants "participated in, approved, encouraged, directed, and aided and abetted human subject experiments in Guatemala."</p>

<p>News of these experiments <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/health/research/02infect.html">came to light in 2010</a> [NYT report]. It was closely followed by an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/01/us-usa-guatemala-experiment-idUSTRE6903RZ20101001">apology by Barack Obama</a> [Reuters report] to the president of Guatemala and a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/guatemalans-file-class-action-suit-over-us-medical-experiments.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of seven Guatemalans who claimed that they had been the subject of non-consensual human medical experimentation by the <a href="http://www.usphs.gov">US Public Health Service</a> [official website]. That challenge was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-dismisses-over-us-medical-experiments-in-guatemala.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], as the US government is specifically exempt from liability for torts that occur outside of the US. Although the presiding judge acknowledged that "the Guatemala Study is a deeply troubling chapter in our Nation's history," he found that the court had no authority to provide relief. While news of the experiments came out in 2010, the specific details of the experiments remained hidden until the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues published its <a href="http://bioethics.gov/node/559">report</a> [text] in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Sudanese government's "crackdown on independent media and civil society" will have a chilling effect on political speech, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr54/1364/2015/en/">warned</a> [press release] Thursday. AI said the situation is particularly troublesome as <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article54421">Sudan's general elections will commence on April 13</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> report]. The briefing detailed several recent instances of dissenters, namely journalists, who have been interrogated for their work. Specifically, one journalist was arrested and faces the death penalty if convicted. Several civil society organizations have been closed and it is possible that more closures will follow. AI argues the recent crackdown is the result of the enforcement of repressive laws and constitutional amendments granting the <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/sudan-governments-intelligence-and-security-service-carrying-out-brutal-campaign-of-killings-torture">National Intelligence and Security Service</a> [AI backgrounder] sweeping powers. AI believes that opposition parties will boycott the general elections.</p>

<p>The government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sudan">Sudan</a> [JURIST news archive] has faced international criticism for its human rights record. In 2013 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end its crackdown against political and cultural groups. In 2012 the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] called on Sudanese authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">investigate an ambush</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2012 the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">called on Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to investigate violent and excessive force by the government against protesters. Earlier that year AI and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-urge-sudan-government-to-end-abuse-of-protesters.php">pressured Sudan to end violence and abuse against protesters</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2012 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-calls-on-sudan-government-to-improve-humanitarian-conditions.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about deteriorating conditions in Sudan due to continued violent conflict in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The new military courts established in Pakistan sentenced six Islamic militants to death on Thursday and a seventh to life in prison for their involvement in terrorism. A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-pakistan-military-courts-idUSKBN0MT1EU20150402">military spokesman said</a> [Reuters report] the seven men were convicted of "heinous offenses" including terrorism, murder, suicide bombing, kidnapping for ransom and colossal damage to life and property. The military court said those convicted could appeal. Pakistan's nine military courts were established in January after Taliban militants attacked a school in Peshawar, killing 134 students and 19 adults. Military power was subsequently expanded, giving military courts jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism despite the country's civilian government. Critics argue that the new procedures defer too much power to the military. Allegations of torture and judicial abuse were widespread during the reign of previous Pakistani military courts. However, many Pakistanis support the military courts due to the crumbling civilian system. </p>

<p>Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] last December, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, last month the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row are <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">minors</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called on Pakistan in January to end the increase in executions following the Peshawar school attack, and in February the rights group said that use of the death penalty in Pakistan is undergoing a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-slams-disturbing-and-dangerous-escalation-of-death-penalty-in-pakistan.php">"disturbing and dangerous"</a> [JURIST report] escalation after the execution of two men convicted of non-terrorism offenses. A judge in Pakistan's <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore District and Sessions Court</a>m[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-man-sentenced-to-death-for-blasphemy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] an offender to death for blasphemy last month. Also last month Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-authorities-execute-12-after-six-year-moratorium-lifted.php">hung 12 men</a> [JURIST report], the largest number of people executed in a single day since the moratorium was lifted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/executive-order-obama-establishes-sanctions-program-to-combat-cyberattacks-cyberspying/1502/">signed an executive order</a> [text] to increase penalties against foreign cybersecurity threats. The executive order establishes sanctions against individuals or entities outside the US that engage in "significant malicious cyber-enabled activity." The new sanctions program authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and Secretary of State, to sanction "malicious cyber actors whose actions threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States." The penalties imposed include blocking actors' property and interests in property in the US, imposing restrictions to business activities within the US, and the imposition of a travel ban to the US.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has identified cybersecurity as "one of the most serious economic and national security issues" that the US is currently facing, and the US government has dedicated significant resources to address the issue. In April 2013 the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/us-house-passes-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">passed a controversial cybersecurity bill</a> [JURIST report] that allows corporations to share customers' personal data with other firms and the US government, even if a company contract prohibits such activity. A year prior, Obama administration official Melanie Ann Pustay testified before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/obama-administration-seeks-new-protections-for-cybersecurity-infrastructure-information.php">urge congressional officials to amend</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [official website] in order to strengthen the government's ability to prevent disclosure of information related to critical infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran on Thursday agreed in principle to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/04/240170.htm">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a> (JCPOA) [press release], creating significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade in return for a reduction of international economic sanctions. Just three days after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/nuclear-talks-with-iran-intensify-close-to-preliminary-deadline.php">self-imposed deadline</a> [JURIST report] for a preliminary deal, Iran agreed to an outline deal between the US and five other major world powers that will limit Iran's ability to undertake nuclear operations that could lead to nuclear weaponry, in return for a gradual lifting of the economic sanctions against Iran that have plagued the nation for years. The current agreement is not a final deal, but <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/04/240196.htm">according to</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website], it creates a "solid foundation for the good deal [the nations] are seeking." If struck, the deal would limit Iran to the three nuclear facilities it currently runs, only one of which that would enrich uranium. The deal would also require a one-year "breakout period," allowing Iran a full year to build up the material needed for one nuclear warhead. Currently, estimates indicate that Iran could build up enough material in two to three months. Iran's benefits would include the gradual suspension of international sanctions that have stifled the nation's economy for years.</p>

<p>Over the past several years Iran has been subject to numerous sanctions for its contentious nuclear program, although <a href="/forum/2012/05/daniel-joyner-iran-sanctions.php">some doubt the efficacy of such sanctions</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The US and France <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-and-france-want-stronger-nuclear-talks-with-iran.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in March to strengthen nuclear talks with Iran to persuade the nation to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. In February, the UN International Atomic Energy Agency <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/iaea-iran-violated-joint-plan-of-action.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for violating its duties under the Joint Plan of Action, a negotiation between Iran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia, whereby Iran has agreed to expand its nuclear program peacefully. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced in December that Iran and the six world powers were <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/world-powers-set-to-resume-talks-on-nuclear-program-with-iran.php">set to resume</a> [JURIST report] low-level talks on Iran's nuclear program in Geneva in January. Iranian leaders have <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-says-it-will-continue-to-expand.php">repeatedly claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the developing nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the international community, Israel in particular, worries that Iran's enrichment program was designed for military purposes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2015/american-citizen-charged-with-conspiring-to-provide-material-support-to-terrorists">charged</a> [press release] Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, a US citizen, with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. The court issued a complaint and arrest warrant, alleging that Farekh "conspired with others to provide material support to terrorists and specifically to provide personnel to be used in support of efforts to kill American citizens and members of the [US] military abroad." The charges arose out of an event in 2007, when he and two others, all students at the University of Manitoba in Canada, left school to travel across Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and train with al-Qaeda. Farekh, originally detained in Pakistan, will face his charges in an initial appearance today before a federal magistrate judge for the Eastern District of New York. If convicted, he faces a maximum prison sentence of fifteen years.</p>

<p>Farekh conspired with two other individuals, Ferid Imam and another unnamed individual. According to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], Imam trained Najibullah Zazi and two other men in al-Qaeda who were later <a href="/thisday/2011/07/doj-announced-charges-for-nyc-subway-bomb-plot.php">convicted of plotting a suicide bombing</a> [JURIST report] of the New York City subway system. The complaint against Farekh <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/03/us-usa-security-operative-idUSKBN0MT20N20150403">indicates</a> [Reuters report] that two of the individuals involved in the suicide bombing provided evidence against Farekh. In 2013 Farekh was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/american-citizen-suspected-of-being-al-qaeda-member-captured-brought-to-us/2015/04/02/48e8cc4c-d89c-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html">assigned</a> [Washington Post article] to the Pentagon's "kill list" of suspected terrorists, but officials were not authorized to kill him due to his US citizenship and uncertain involvement in al-Qaeda.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50494#.VR6_sBPF9H0">United Nations internal inquiry</a> [report] on Thursday concluded that members of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma/">UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali</a> (MINUSMA) used "unauthorized and excessive force" resulting in the deaths of three civilian protesters and the injuries of four other individuals in January. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8361">Launched</a> [press release] in February, the inquiry also concluded that some protestors bore responsibility for the violence after the inquiry found that protestors threw Molotov cocktails and stones at the MINUSMA Headquarters in Gao, which injured five MINUSMA officers. In a <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sgsm16640.doc.htm">statement</a> [press release], <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/index.asp">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] expressed regret regarding the "casualties among civilians resulting from the excessive use of force," and condemned it as "a violation of the MINUSMA Directive on the Use of Force." He also expressed a commitment to "ensuring that the responsible individuals are held fully accountable for their actions." However, holding those responsible for their actions may prove difficult as UN personnel have diplomatic immunity, leaving prosecution up to the peacekeepers' home country of Rwanda. </p>

<p>Following the armed rising against the Malian government in early 2012, the nation has experienced significant turmoil relating to the exercise of power by the Malian government and opposing forces. Earlier this month, the Taureg-led rebels in Mali <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-mali-talks-idUSKBN0MT29S20150402">met with</a> [Reuters report] Algerian mediators to discuss terms of preliminary peace deals, the same deals they rejected last month. Those rebels are currently in fights with French and U.N. troops in northern Mali, seeking autonomy for the Azawad desert region. In March of last year, UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-expert-urges-mali-to-strengthen-judicial-system.php">urged</a> Mali to strengthen its judicial system due to the difficulty faced in attempting to prosecute war crimes in the nation, and called on MINUSMA to assist. In November 2014 General Amadou Haya Sanogo, the leader of the March 2012 coup, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-mali-junta-detained-for-murder.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of murder, complicity to murder, assassination and kidnapping. In March 2013 Malian Tuareg rebels <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mali-rebels-call-for-icc-investigation.php">called on the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged war crimes committed by Malian government forces during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valarie Amos</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/USG%20Valerie%20Amos%20Statement%20on%20Yemen%202April2015.pdf">statement</a> on Friday expressing the concern of the <a href="http://www.unocha.org">Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> (OCHA) [official website] for the safety of civilians in Yemen. Amos referred to humanitarian reports, which indicate that over the past two weeks 519 people have been killed and 1,700 others have been injured, at least 90 of which were children. Yemeni hospitals are in short supply of necessary medicines, and citizens have begun to flee from their homes to seek relief in Djibouti and Somalia. Amos called on all parties involved in the conflict in Yemen to "meet their obligations under international law and do their utmost to protect the ordinary women, children and men who are suffering the consequences of the conflict." UN agencies are currently working closely with Yemen Red Crescent and the local Yemen authorities to supply citizens with emergency health kits, which allow for clean water, food and blankets.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] has sparked major international concern. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official websites] have each recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-alarmed-by-rising-civilian-casualties-in-yemen.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilian lives as Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have continued. <br />
Last week during an emergency meeting, the UN special envoy to Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-envoy-warns-security-council-that-yemen-nearing-civil-war.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the UN security Council that the situation in Yemen is teetering on the brink of civil war. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-calls-for-reinstatement-of-yemeni-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Yemen to reinstate President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/jst">US District Judge Jon Tigar</a> [official profile] for the Northern District of California issued a <a href="http://transgenderlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Norsworthy-Order-on-PI.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] on Thursday ordering the California Department of Corrections to grant a transgender inmate's sex reassignment surgery. Michelle-Lael Norsworthy began living as a woman in the 1990s while in state prison, where she was later diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria. Ms. Norsworthy received counseling and hormone therapy from the department of corrections, but her request for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) was denied by the department, who cited a policy against approving SRS as a treatment for transgender inmates. Ms. Norsworthy brought a suit seeking a preliminary injunction, which would require the department of corrections to grant her request for SRS. In his decision, Judge Tigar stated that the California Department of Corrections violated <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] protections against cruel and unusual punishment, and the Equal Protection clause within the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. Should the Department of Corrections comply with the court order, Ms. Norsworthy would be the first inmate to undergo the SRS procedure.  </p>

<p>The fight for LGBT rights is currently hotly contested and extremely salient. Last week the Indiana Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">approved</a> a "religious freedom" <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/101#digest-heading">bill</a> [JURIST report, SB 101] that allows business owners to turn away patrons based on sexual orientation for the purpose of preventing undue burden on business' owners religious beliefs. Earlier this month the<a href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2015/HB2307/"> Oregon</a> and <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=billinfo&Service=Billbook&menu=true&ga=86&hbill=SF31">Iowa</a> [legislative materials] legislatures <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-iowa-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] measures that would prevent health care professionals from providing counseling intended to change a persons sexual orientation, also known as "conversion therapy." The day before, a transgender inmate from Massachusetts filed a <a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/kosilek-v-spencer/cert-petition.pdf">petition</a> [cert. petition, PDF] for <em>certiorari</em> to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/transgender-inmate-petitions-supreme-court-for-sex-reassignment-surgery.php">asking</a> [JURIST report] a ruling that denied her the ability to obtain SRS to be overturned. While Utah lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-lawmakers-unveil-lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2015/bills/static/SB0296.html">bill</a> [text] earlier this month that would add protections against LGBT discrimination in the workplace and housing, the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arkansas-legislature-passes-bill-that-could-allow-increased-lgbt-discrimination.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2015/2015R/Bills/SB202.pdf">bill</a> [SB 202] that prohibits such protections to be utilized. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China's former national security chief <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26349305">Zhou Yongkang</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="http://www.spp.gov.cn/qwfb/201504/t20150403_94513.shtml">charged</a> [press release, in Chinese] with bribery, abuse of power and disclosing state secrets on Friday, making him the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/world/asia/china-zhou-yongkang-communist-party-faces-corruption-trial.html?_r=0">highest-ranked official</a> [NYT report] to be charged with political corruption in decades. Zhou was the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32172600">head</a> [BBC report] of the <a href="http://www.mps.gov.cn/English/">Ministry of Public Security</a> [official website] until his retirement in 2012 and oversaw law enforcement, national security and intelligence services. After Zhou's retirement, the government began investigating him and former officials who worked under him in the <a href="http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/">China National Petroleum Corporation</a> [official website] and in government. He was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/chinas-former-security-chief-arrested-expelled-from-communist-party.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] and expelled from the ruling Communist Party last December. Zhou will have an open trial in Tianjin, although no date has been set. Prosecutors have not made public the details of Zhou's charges. </p>

<p>Since the appointment of President Xi Jinping in 2013, China has set out on a campaign against corruption. In February Chinese officials said they will <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-to-prosecute-top-parliamentary-official-for-graft.php">prosecute</a> [JURIST report] Su Rong, former vice-chairman of the country's top parliamentary advisory body, for graft, including taking bribes and selling ranks and titles. Last month the Chinese government also <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/china-implicates-14-generals-in-anti-corruption-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the conviction and investigation of 14 generals for corrupt financial practices. In recent months China has also set out to reform its court system. Last October China announced a blueprint for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/communist-party-of-china-announces-legal-reform-giving-judges-more-independence.php">judicial reform</a> [JURIST report] aimed at giving judges more independence and limiting the influence of local officials over courts. Guidelines for the reform were <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/china-communist-party-introduces-guidelines-to-strengthen-legal-system.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the following week. In February China's <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] announced a five-year comprehensive <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-top-court-announces-five-year-legal-reform-plan.php">legal reform plan</a> [JURIST report] to make the judiciary more impartial, fair, independent and accountable as a way to emphasize the rule of law and "safeguard national unity."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/">Governor Mike Pence</a> [official website] signed into law on Thursday an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1699997-read-the-updated-indiana-religious-freedom.html">amended</a> [text, PDF] version of the controversial <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/101#document-92bab197">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text], which critics argued gave business owners the legal right to deny service based on sexual orientation. The amended legislation states that the religious freedom law does not authorize any business to refuse to provide service to any individual or customer based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in addition to race, color, religion, age, national origin, disability and military service. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-lawmakers-propose-anti-discrimination-amendment-to-religious-freedom-law.php">legislation was proposed</a> [JURIST report] earlier Thursday by Republican lawmakers and was approved by both the Indiana House and Senate before being signed into law. Churches and other nonprofit religious organizations are exempted. Also Thursday Arkansas <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/">Governor Asa Hutchinson</a> [official website] of Arkansas signed an <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2015/2015R/Amendments/sb975-S1.pdf">amended version</a> [text, PDF] of a <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2015/2015R/Bills/HB1228.pdf">'religious freedom' law</a> [text, PDF] sent to him earlier this week. The considerable backlash from the Indiana bill may be the reason Hutchinson <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/arkansas-house-approves-religious-freedom-bill.php">declined to sign a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] until state lawmakers brought it more in line with federal legislation. </p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, as well as freedom of religious practice, remain controversial issues in the US. Nineteen other states have enacted some variety of religious freedom laws, most modeled after the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993. At the time, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/us/clinton-signs-law-protecting-religious-practices.html">Clinton stated</a> [NYT report] that the law subjects the federal government to "a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion." Pence signed Indiana's original controversial version into law after the state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill by a 40-10 vote. Proponents of the bill, such as Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor Daniel Conkle <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">argue</a> [<em>Indianapolis Star</em> op-ed] that it "protect[s] religious believers of all faiths by granting them precisely the same consideration [as the federal law.]" The bill's strong opposition, however, argued that the law and those like it undermine the American spirit of inclusion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=3543&ctl=Details&mid=6187&ItemID=2025139&language=en-US">strongly condemned</a> [press release] the continuous airstrikes on an airport in the western town of Zintan, claiming the attacks pose danger to civilians and are undermining efforts to find a solution to the Libyan crisis. Neither the rebels nor the Libyan government are claiming responsibility for the attacks. UNSMIL reminded all parties that the recent attacks on civilian facilities <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50491#.VR7NP2aosZI">may constitute war crimes</a> [UN News Centre report] under international humanitarian law. UNSMIL chief Bernardino Leon has been facilitating negotiation efforts between the government and rebels toward a ceasefire and a reduction in hostilities, and he urged all combative actors to desist from taking steps that increase tension. The warplane that carried out the strikes was unidentifiable, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/01/us-libya-security-idUSKBN0MS41U20150401">damaging a passenger terminal</a> [Reuters report] but resulting in no casualties. </p>

<p>Libya remains politically unstable more than four years after the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war that deposed Muammar Gaddafi. Much of the escalating violence in Libya is attributable to the Islamic State (IS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The group has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. In March UNSMIL <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-libya-mission-unveils-peace-proposal.php">released a peace proposal</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to end the country's political instability and "deteriorating military situation." Also in March the head of the UNSMIL warned the UN Security Council that without intervention from the international community and UN, Libya is likely to become <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-deteriorating-rapidly.php">unstable</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of repeated terrorist attacks. In February the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Libyan extremists' beheading of 21 Coptic Christians. Also in February Human Rights Watch released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya0215_ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] detailing the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-journalists-under-attack-in-libya.php">violent attacks on Libyan journalists</a> [JURIST report] by various armed groups over the past two years. The UN reported in March that armed groups are increasingly <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-libya-armed-groups-attacking-human-rights-defenders.php">attacking and threatening human rights defenders</a> [JURIST report], who wish to shed light on widespread human rights abuses in Libya. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Religion/CV_bielefeldt.pdf">Heiner Bielefeldt</a> [official profile, PDF], on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15795&LangID=E">praised</a> [press release] Lebanon's tradition of religious tolerance in a region plagued by religious fanaticism as a "ray of hope." Bielefeldt attributes Lebanon's success in preserving peace to the learned practice of coexisting under precarious conditions, inter religious dialogues, cooperation and Lebanese citizenship. However, in order to achieve their goal of becoming a civil state based on the rule of law, Bielefeldt said Lebanon still needs to overcome the political confessionalism present in the country. Bielefeldt stressed that "[d]isentangling the tightly knit web of religious loyalties, political affiliations, social positions and societal opportunities may then enhance the prospects of common citizenship," but he noted that while "equal power sharing on one hand maintains stable relationship among religious denominations, it may on the other hand weaken the civil structure and reinforce political fragmentation." The Special Rapporteur also noted that allowing civil marriage would be an additional step into furthering diversity in Lebanon, as it would promote more freedom of religion and diminish discrimination against women in streamlining the union of mixed couples. </p>

<p>Because of its geographic position, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14647308">Lebanon</a> [BBC profile] has been implicated in much of the discord surrounding the Middle East region, including being one of the countries enumerated in the efforts by former president George W. Bush's <a href="/feature/2013/07/the-war-on-terror.php">war on terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In recent years, Lebanon has made a concerted effort to deviate and disapprove of the combative actions of its neighbors. In January of last year under the support of the UN backed <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> [official website; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/lebanon/tribunal/">backgrounder</a>], the country began the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/lebanon-tribunal-opens-hariri-assassination-trial.php">trial</a> [JURIST report] of four <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=3101">Hezbollah</a> [START backgrounder] members accused of executing a terrorist attack that killed a former Lebanese prime minister and 21 others. In April of last year the country passed a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/lebanon-parliament-passes-domestic-violence-law.php">law</a> [JURIST report] criminalizing domestic violence after the deaths of multiple women that were said to be by the hands of their husbands. However, there are still strides to be made, as is evidenced by a declaration made in August by Lebanon's Minister of Justice calling for the <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/lebanon-official-urges-punishment-for-isis-flag-burning.php">"sternest punishment"</a> [JURIST report] to individuals who burned flags belonging to the militant group, <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Fifteen states, led by Louisiana, <a href="/paperchase/Louisianaamicusbrief.pdf">urged</a> [amicus brief, PDF] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday to uphold same-sex marriage bans. The brief asserts that voters should decide for themselves whether to allow same-sex marriages in their respective states. Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia joined the brief, even though courts have struck down same-sex marriage bans in these states. Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas, which have not legalized same-sex marriage, were the other states that took part in the brief. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in January to rule on same-sex marriage, and oral arguments are scheduled for April 28.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is currently legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia but continues to be a controversial issue. In March Puerto Rican officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/puerto-rico-officials-to-stop-opposing-same-sex-marriage.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Puerto Rico is ending its defense of a same-sex marriage ban. Last month a federal court stayed a ruling of the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website], which would have <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-appeals-court-blocks-same-sex-marriage-in-nebraska.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] same-sex couples in Nebraska to marry. The <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/supreme">Supreme Court of Texas</a> [official website] granted an <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/texas-supreme-court-issues-order-blocking-same-sex-marriage.php">emergency stay</a> [JURIST report] of two trial court decisions in Travis County in February, which held that an amendment to Texas's constitution banning same-sex marriage violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> [Cornell LLI backgrounders] clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Michigan's governor said in February that his state will <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/michigan-will-not-appeal-same-sex-marriage-recognition-ruling.php">not challenge</a> [press release] a decision by the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] ordering the state to recognize more than 300 same-sex marriages. In January Miami-Dade became the first county in Florida to <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/miami-dade-county-first-in-florida-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-dnp.php">allow</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage, hours ahead of statewide legalization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?jezik=e">Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?id=2884&jezik=e">indicted</a> [press release] three people for war crimes committed against Serb victims. The indicted, Zdenko Andabak, Muamir Jasharevic and Sead Velagic, are accused of committing crimes against humanity against more than 300 Serb civilians between April 1992 and July 1993. The indictment charged the men with torturing and detaining civilians in inhumane conditions and killing 16 people of Serb ethnicity while they were members of the Croatian Defense Council Military Police in Livno. The prosecutors included 120 pieces of evidence to support the indictment, which will be forwarded to the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for confirmation. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. In February Serbian war crimes prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/5-indicted-for-1993-balkan-war-massacre.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] five people with committing a wartime massacre during the Balkan conflict. Also in February the International Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icj-rules-serbia-and-croatia-did-not-commit-genocide.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Serbia and Croatia did not commit genocide against one another's citizens during the 1990s war. In January the war crimes division of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-politician-for-genocide.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] the indictment of Dragomir Vasic on charges of genocide. The charges stemmed from the executions of Srebrenica Muslims during the Bosnian Civil War.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Delaware Senate voted 11-9 Thursday to <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/LIS148.NSF/93487d394bc01014882569a4007a4cb7/aa50df9e3bfc309285257e030052fe65?OpenDocument">repeal the death penalty</a> [SB 40 materials]. The legislation is being sponsored by <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/legislature.nsf/bydistrict/senator9">Senator Karen Peterson</a> [official website] and includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row, who will face death by lethal injection. Delaware is one of 32 states that employ <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/05/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-executions-in-the-united-states/">capital punishment</a> [WP backgrounder]. Supporters of the death penalty believe that it is a just penalty for the most detestable of offenses, but detractors say execution is costly, encourages violence against minorities, and violates human rights. </p>

<p>The death penalty and the use of alternative drug protocols in lethal injections remain <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">controversial topics</a> [JURIST archive] in both the US and abroad. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah the only US state with such an option. Also in March the Alabama House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/alabama-votes-to-keep-execution-drug-suppliers-secret-bring-back-electric-chair.php">voted to keep execution</a> [JURIST report] drug suppliers' names secret and to bring back the use of the electric chair when chemical related lethal injection methods are not available. In February US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/holder-voices-support-for-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">voiced his support</a> [JURIST report] for a moratorium on the death penalty pending a decision by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012315zr_6jgm.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order, PDF] in late January to determine the constitutionality of Oklahoma's three-drug execution protocol. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Malaysian cartoonist known for his political caricatures was charged Friday with nine counts of sedition over a series of tweets criticizing the country's judiciary. Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, popularly referred to as Zunar, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysian-cartoonist-zunar-charged-with-nine-counts-of-sedition-1428040017">could be sentenced</a> [AP report] to up to 43 years in jail if found guilty on all nine charges. The tweets, which criticized the judiciary for sentencing opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim to five years in prison on sodomy charges, were posted on Zunar's public <a href="https://twitter.com/zunarkartunis">Twitter page</a> [media website], which also includes this short bio, "Political Cartoonist - To Fight Through Cartoon - My cartoons are directed towards fighting the tyranny and corruption, of the government of Malaysia." The Malaysian Sedition Act criminalizes promoting hatred against the government.</p>

<p>Limiting free speech in regards to political expression and criticism is a controversial issue worldwide. In March Malaysian officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/daughter-of-malaysia-opposition-leader-arrested-for-sedition.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] the daughter of jailed opposition leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16440290">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile] for alleged acts of sedition. She was reportedly arrested and detained specifically for a speech she made criticizing the jailing of her father. Anwar Ibrahim's conviction on sodomy charges was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/malaysia-top-court-upholds-opposition-leaders-sodomy-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in February, as was his five-year prison sentence. Many critics in Malaysia and abroad have claimed the arrest is a politically driven act to fight the opposing potential threat of the People's Justice party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/4dca.htm">California Fourth District Court of Appeal</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://media.nbcbayarea.com/documents/Court+of+Appeal+Opinion+-+Sedlock+v++Baird+(Encinitas+Union+Sch++Dist+)+(S0229513).pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] yoga classes in public schools, holding that such classes do not violate religious rights of students or their parents. Families of children enrolled in the Encinitas Union School District sued the school, alleging that yoga classes provide a gateway to Hinduism, and are an "impermissible establishment of religion" in violation of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California Constitution</a> [text]. Representatives of the school district contended that yoga was taught in a way that separated it from religion. The court unanimously agreed with the school district, explaining that, "[w]hile the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are&#8230; devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings." </p>

<p>Encinitas <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/02/us-usa-yoga-california-idUSBRE96016Y20130702">introduced</a> [Reuters report] yoga as a pilot program to one of its nine elementary schools in 2011, resulting in just 40 to 45 of the 5,000 students being pulled out of the class by their parents. Yoga is taught in many other schools in the US, but the Encinitas Union School District is reportedly the first of the school districts to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/court-rules-favour-teaching-yoga-schools-150404001714944.html">offer</a> [Al Jazeera report] classes on a full-time basis. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/04/03/diamond_statement_of_interest.pdf">statement of interest</a> [text, PDF] on Friday with the <a href="http://www.gamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Georgia</a> [official website] stating that the Eighth Amendment requires individualized assessment and treatment for inmates suffering from gender dysphoria. The <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/?ref=logo">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/complaint_2.pdf">brought suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in February, claiming that the <a href="http://www.dcor.state.ga.us/">Georgia Department of Corrections</a> (GDC) [official website] denied plaintiff Ashley Diamond medically necessary hormone treatment and failed to protect her from sexual assault by other inmates at a men's prison. Although physicians <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-brief-address-health-care-prisoners-suffering-gender-dysphoria">confirmed that Diamond suffered from gender dysphoria</a> [press release] and recommended continuing hormone therapy, GDC claimed that its policies precluded it from moving Diamond to a secure prison for females and continuing her hormone treatment. The DOJ urged the court to find in Diamond's favor and issue injunctive relief providing for her transfer to a prison for women and her ongoing hormone therapy.</p>

<p>Earlier this week the US District Court for the Northern District of California ordered the California Department of Corrections to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/federal-judge-orders-california-prison-to-grant-inmate-sex-change.php">grant a transgender inmate's sex reassignment surgery</a> [JURIST report]. Last month a transgender inmate from Massachusetts filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em> with the US Supreme Court, <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/transgender-inmate-petitions-supreme-court-for-sex-reassignment-surgery.php">asking</a> [JURIST report] it to overturn a ruling that denied her the ability to obtain sex reassignment surgery. In February the Florida House of Representatives introduced a bill that would <a href="/dateline/2015/02/brian-eisner-gender-equality.php">prohibit transgender people from choosing a bathroom</a> [JURIST op-ed] corresponding to their gender identity, instead <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/09/florida-transgender-bathroom-law_n_6645910.html">confining them to use the bathroom</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] designated to the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Saturday urged Egypt to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/04/egypt-halt-executions-six-men">halt the executions of six men</a> [press release] convicted by a military tribunal for participating in attacks on security forces and killing two armed forces officers in a shootout in 2014. A total of nine men were accused and convicted of participating in the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/19/world/meast/egypt-raid-shootout/">attack on Egyptian security forces</a> [CNN report] last March, killing two soldiers. The attack was orchestrated by <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/04/224566.htm">Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis</a> [Department of State backgrounder], which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/egypt-court-declares-ansar-bayt-al-maqdis-a-terrorist-organization.php">designated a terrorist organization</a> in Egypt last year, with the group claiming responsibility for the majority of attacks on Egyptian military and police that have occurred since the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php#.U0xHXq1dWAA">ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST reports]. Two of the nine men accused of the March attack were sentenced to life in prison, with the remaining seven sentenced to death. One man was convicted and sentenced to death in <em>absentia</em>. HRW urged Egyptian authorities to stay the executions and to retry the cases before civilian courts.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Amnesty International reported an <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-alarming-rise-in-death-sentences-in-2014.php">"alarming rise" in death sentences</a> around the world in 2014&#8211;a trend especially prominent in Egypt, which has <a href="/forum/2015/01/mohamed-arafa-egypt-judiciaryphp.php">gained notoriety for its mass death sentences</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last month an Egyptian court sentenced a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death</a> [JURIST report] after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-retrial-for-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">ordered a retrial of 36 Muslim Brotherhood supporters</a> [JURIST report]. The 36 are among <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/egyptian-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183.php">183 supporters sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in June in connection with violence following the ouster of president Mohammed Morsi in 2013. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Saturday began the retrial of former president Hosni Mubarak and his two sons for their alleged diversion of public funds to upgrade family properties last year. The three allegedly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/04/us-egypt-mubarak-idUSKBN0MV08L20150404">diverted</a> [Reuters report] funds that were to be used for renovations to the presidential palace. Mubarak and his sons were originally imprisoned for their convictions. Mubarak was handed a three-year sentence, and his two sons each handed four-year sentences. Mubarak and his sons were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egypt-authorities-release-mubaraks-sons.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in January. The former president's case is now adjourned until April 29.</p>

<p>Mubarak and other members of his administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-clears-mubarak-era-official-of-last-corruption-charge.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak-era official Habib el-Adly of corruption charges after his having been accused of using his political influence to acquire approximate 181 million Egyptian pounds (USD $23 million). In February the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/egypt-court-acquits-ex-interior-minister-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] el-Adly and Mubarak-era prime minister Ahmed Nazif of "squandering public funds and profiteering" after allegedly making an illegal deal with German Company UTSCH to sell license plates for higher than market value. In January an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/mubarak-fraud-conviction-overturned-dnp.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's fraud conviction. In December 2013 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/former-egypt-pm-sons-of-mubarak-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Egyptian prime minister and presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq and Alaa and Gamal Mubarak of charges of embezzling public funds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kuwait's Supreme Court on Sunday upheld a two-year prison sentence for a man accused of insulting the emir on Twitter, his lawyer said. Opposition activist Ayyad al-Harbi is an online journalist in his 20s who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3026379/Kuwaits-court-upholds-jail-term-activist-tweets.html">posted</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] verses by an Iraqi poet critical of the nation's ruler. Al-Harbi was sentenced to two years in prison for the crime in May, and could have faced as much as five years. Lawyer Mohammed al-Humaidi said al-Harbi's final hope now would be a pardon by the emir.</p>

<p>The Kuwaiti government has been criticized for not permitting free speech and restricting the right to assembly in the country. Last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that riot police in Kuwait <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/jurist-riot-police-in-kuwait.php">disbanded</a> [JURIST report] protests, arresting 16 protesters who may be charged with attacking law enforcement officers and illegal gathering. In January Nabil al-Fadhl, a member of the Kuwait parliament, was charged with <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-lawmaker-facing-legal-action-for-supporting-sale-of-alcohol.php">insulting</a> [JURIST report] the honor of Kuwaiti society and history after making a comment in support of the legalized sale of alcohol. Later that month a Kuwaiti appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-court-upholds-prison-sentence-for-insulting-ruler-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling that sentenced a man to five years in prison for posting comments about the Gulf nation's ruler on Twitter.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia was granted bail on Sunday after surrendering to the court in Dhaka. Zia, the leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), had been <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32188301">voluntarily confined</a> [BBC report] to her office since January 5, when an indefinite transport blockade was called on the anniversary of the previous election. She faces charges of embezzling money from two corruption cases between 2001 and 2006 and instigating violence. The trial began last year, and an arrest warrant was issued for Zia in February when she failed to appear in court.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Zia has faced criminal charges since she left office in 2006. In May 2008 Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/bangladesh-ex-pm-zia-charged-with.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] formal charges against Zia for an alleged kickback scheme that awarded lucrative gas contracts to Canadian oil company <a href="http://www.nikoresources.com/">Niko Resources Ltd</a> [corporate website]. The ACC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-ex-pms-son-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Zia's eldest son with corruption in July 2010 for allegedly laundering USD $3 million through bank accounts in Singapore. In March 2014 the former prime minister and other members of the BNP were <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/former-bangladesh-pm-charged-with-corruption.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] on two corruption charges, accused of embezzling funds from a charitable trust named after Zia's deceased husband. Bangladesh's High Court ruled Zia must <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/bangladesh-court-orders-former-pm-to-stand-trial-for-corruption.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges last April. In February, an arrest warrant was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arrest-warrant-issued-for-former-bangladesh-pm.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] for Zia again when she and 55 other people were charged for instigating an arson attack on a bus. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16440290">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile] was granted a furlough on Sunday to leave prison so that he could attend his father's funeral. Anwar was taken from the prison under heavy security to his father's house and will have to return to prison after the burial. His father, who died Sunday morning and whose cause of death is still unknown, was 96 years old. Anwar had just begun serving a five-year sentence his sodomy conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/malaysia-top-court-upholds-opposition-leaders-sodomy-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in February. Anwar was accused of sodomizing an aide in the opposition campaign office in 2008 in violation of Section 377B of the Malaysian Penal Code. The Federal Court rejected Anwar's argument that the case was a political conspiracy, a decision rights groups are calling unjust.</p>

<p>Anwar has continually <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-denies-charges-at-sodomy-trial.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the sodomy charge. The Kuala Lumpur High Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/malaysia-opposition-leader-cleared-of-sodomy-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Anwar in January 2012. In March 2014 an appeals court overturned the <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/malaysia-appeals-court-finds-opposition-leader-guilty-of-sodomy.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced Anwar to five years in prison. The opposition leader was arrested in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">accuser</a> [JURIST reports] a month earlier. In December 2010 Anwar <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a WikiLeaks cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. Anwar was Malaysia's deputy prime minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian prosecutor referred 187 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to a military court on Sunday. The supporters are accused of killing police officers while storming a Maghagha police station in the southern province of Minya in August 2013, only weeks after the removal of former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile]. Egypt had recently expanded the jurisdiction of its military courts in order to allow them to crackdown on liberal activism, especially such attacks on state facilities. It was originally only intended to be a crackdown on Islamists. The expansion came in response to some of the most serious attacks on security forces since the removal of Morsi in summer 2013. The supporters <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/04/05/egypt-brotherhood-courts-idINKBN0MW07T20150405">face charges</a> [Reuters report] of murder and attempted murder of police officers, possessing weapons and joining a banned group. The Brotherhood says it is committed to political change through peaceful means only.</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Late last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] 68 people, including members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court on <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state. In February An Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death, along with 14 others to life in prison. The individuals were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges, after clashes near the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, which occurred just days before the ouster of Morsi. Also in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] on bail of two Al Jazeera journalists being retried on terror charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Indonesian court on Monday rejected the appeals of two Australians on death row for drug smuggling. The two Australians, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, are known leaders of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/bali-nine-hard-won-public-sympathy-appears-no-match-for-judicial-resolve">Bali Nine</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder] narcotics organization. They filed <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indonesian-court-to-hear-appeal-for-two-australian-drug-smugglers-on-death-row.php">appeals</a> [JURIST report] after <a href="https://bbc6.azurewebsites.net/news/world-asia-28422179">President Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] rejected their pleas to spare their lives. Lawyers for the Australians expressed disappointment with the decision and said they <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/04/06/indonesian-court-rejects-appeal-by-australian-drug-smugglers">plan to appeal</a> [AP report] to Indonesia's Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>Indonesia has been under international scrutiny over its use of the death penalty. In February a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. In January another spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The OHCHR reported that eight more people convicted of drug trafficking in Vietnam had been sentenced to death. Also in January Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> [JURIST report] their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.idf.il/english/">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] on Sunday ordered a female Palestinian legislative council member, Khalida Jarrar, to serve a six-month detention without trial. Jarrar, member of the <a href="http://pflp.ps/english/">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a> (PFLP) [party website] has been placed under Israeli <a href="http://pflp.ps/english/2015/04/05/pflp-administrative-detention-order-against-khalida-jarrar-will-not-shake-her-steadfastness/">administrative detention</a> [PFLP press release], a system Israel says exists to prevent attacks by militants. Under administrative detention, individuals may be held captive for up to six months without being charged. The detention may be extended under a judge's approval, and evidence regarding the arrest may be withheld if deemed necessary. Jarrar was <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.650216">arrested</a> [AP report] from her home last week by the Israeli military for incitement and involvement in terrorist activities after she disobeyed an Israel-ordered restriction from movement in the West Bank. Some have called Jarrar's arrest a politically-fueled act, as Jarrar was instrumental in the Palestinian Authority's bid to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/palestine-formally-joins-the-icc.php">formally join</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website].</p>

<p>The conflict between <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel">Israel</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=palestine">Palestine</a> [JURIST news archive] has lasted for years and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7812290.stm">caused</a> [BBC timeline] numerous casualties on both sides. In January the Israel Law Center filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/israel-based-rights-group-files-war-crimes-complaint-with-icc-against-palestinians.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ICC, accusing Palestinian leaders of war crimes including torture, terrorism and civil rights violations. In December <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] declared that Israel's <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/amnesty-israel-attacks-on-gaza-landmark-buildings-were-war-crimes.php">air strikes</a> [JURIST report] on landmark buildings in Gaza were deliberate war crimes that led to the injury of many civilians. In September the Israel Law Center asked the ICC to open an <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into war crimes allegedly committed by Hamas leader, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20623504">Khaled Meshaal</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukrainian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26822741">President Petro Poroshenko</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Petro+Poroshenko">news archive</a>] announced Monday that the Ukrainian government would no longer object to allowing a referendum that could grant greater autonomy to the eastern regions of the country controlled by Russian-backed rebels. This concession <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/news/story/1.3022114">marks</a> [AP report] a major reversal in the Ukrainian government's position regarding the rebel-held regions. Despite the president's decision, rebel leaders have rejected the call for a referendum, insisting that they are no longer striving for increased autonomy from the federal Ukrainian government, but for complete independence from Ukraine. In his speech Monday, Poroshenko also reaffirmed his intent to keep the maintain the strength of the federal government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">Hostilities in Eastern Ukraine</a> [BBC timeline] have decreased after the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed rebels agreed in February to a cease-fire deal brokered by Western leaders in Minsk, Belarus.

Earlier in March the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, stated that <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-office-reports-death-toll-of-6000-in-ukraine.php">more than 6,000 people have died</a> [JURIST report] in eastern Ukraine since the conflict began over a year ago. In February a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon revealed that <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-officials-voice-concern-over-ukraine-ceasefire.php">Ban had spoken</a> [JURIST report] with Ukraine Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin regarding the ceasefire in Ukraine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bangladeshi appeals court on Monday rejected a final <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/bangladesh-war-crimes-convict-appeals-death-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, an Islamist party official convicted of war crimes during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], upholding his death sentence. Kamaruzzaman can seek presidential clemency, but if his plea is rejected <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/bangladesh-upholds-death-penalty-for-islamic-party-official/2015/04/06/ead23ab6-dc34-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html">he will face execution</a> [WP report] soon. Kamaruzzaman would be the second individual executed for crimes related to the 1971 war.</p>

<p>The  <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/index.php">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website], which was established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 conflict, in which about 3 million people were killed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040615zor_4315.pdf">declined to hear</a> [order list, PDF] a challenge to North Carolina voting restrictions that opponents claim were intended to impede Democratic voters from casting ballots. The 2013 North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf">law</a> [bill, PDF] includes provisions that require photo identification, as well as the contested bar on same-day voter registration and provisional voting for voters casting their ballots outside of their normal precincts. The Republican-backed law is challenged on the basis that it makes it substantially more difficult for citizens more inclined to vote for Democratic candidates to cast their ballot by having a disproportionate impact on minorities and the young. The petition for <em>certiorari</em> sought to challenge a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] that provisionally banned the portions of the law banning voter registration and provisional voting until the conclusion of the trial. However, the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case will have limited impact as a full trial to decide the legality of the law will take place this summer. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have been hotly contested in recent months. Last month Oregon became the first state to institute <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">automatic</a> [JURIST report] voter registration, by using data acquired from the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Also in March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lets-wisconsin-voter-id-law-stand.php">declined to rule</a> on Wisconsin's voter ID law, choosing to let the law stand and ignoring <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/aclu-urges-supreme-court-to-review-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">requests</a> [JURIST reports] for review. In November Illinois voters <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/illinois-voters-approve-voter-anti-discrimination-amendment.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would ban all voter discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or income. A few days later, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required voters to furnish proof of citizenship before they were allowed to use federal voter registration forms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that a prosecutor ordered Internet providers to block social networking sites including Twitter and YouTube. The order stems from photos posted on the social media sites that show militant Marxists pointing a gun at a prosecutor who died last week during a shootout between police and the Marxists who were holding him hostage. The government-run <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en">Anadolu Agency</a> [official website] said Internet providers notified Twitter and YouTube about the images and requested removal, but photos and videos continued to be posted on the sites. Government officials called the images anti-government propaganda and blasted Turkish media for the postings. Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/policy">stated</a> [Twitter policy account] that it is working to restore access for users as soon as possible. The journalists group Turkish Press Council argued the ban is in conflict with democracy: "It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms&#8212;which contain billions of useful information&#8212;to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content."</p>

<p>Turkish authorities have been condemned for blocking social media sites in the past. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/turkish-government-weakening-rule-of-law-hrw.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey's ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/site/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] party was taking steps to weaken the rule of law, control Internet and media and suppress critics and protesters. Last April the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/turkish-authorities-lift-twitter-ban-following-court-ruling.php">lifted a ban</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter following a Constitutional Court ruling, which stated that the ban violated both individual rights as well as the freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040615zor_4315.pdf">asked</a> [order list, PDF] for the Obama administration's position on an <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-770.htm">appeal</a> [docket] by the Iranian Central Bank over whether $1.75 billion must be paid to families of the victims of the 1983 Lebanon US Marine Corps barracks bombing. The victims' families were awarded $2.65 billion in 2007 after a US court found Iran backed the Shi'ite militant group's truck bombing, which killed 241 US servicemen. The legal question in the case is whether a 2012 law that specifically addressed the funds at issue violates the US Constitution by dictating the outcome of the court case. The Supreme Court regularly asks for the presidential administration's views on whether to hear cases that affect US interests. The court did not set a deadline for the Obama administration to respond.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/23/newsid_2489000/2489117.stm">1983 Beirut attack</a> [BBC Backgrounder] has been the subject of much legal controversy surrounding compensation of the victims' families. In 2012 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-district-court-judge-royce.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] $44.6 million from Iran to two US marines and their families as a result of injuries sustained in the 1983 suicide-truck bombing on American barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. In September 2007 Iran dismissed a federal court ruling that required the country to <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-judge-fines-iran-265b-for-1983.php">compensate</a> [JURIST reports] the families of 241 US military personnel killed in the 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut. Iran called the $2.65 billion US ruling "baseless" and "politically motivated," as it was the largest judgment ever awarded by a US court against a foreign country. While Iran has consistently been accused of supporting <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder], the militant group behind the bombing, the Islamic Republic has denied responsibility. The American death toll in the 1983 terror attack was the highest on record prior to the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] terrorist attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Wisconsin <a href="https://bradschimel.com/home/">Attorney General Brad Schimel</a> [official website] on Monday appealed a federal court ruling that struck down a <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/lcactmemo/act037">law</a> [text, PDF] requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Schimel appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] in Chicago to attempt to have the law reinstated. The law required that doctors who had performed abortions maintain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortions were performed. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-wisconsin">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.affiliatedmedicalservices.com/">Affiliated Medical Services</a> [corporate website] sued the state, claiming that the law restricted access to abortions in Wisconsin. The plaintiffs contended that, if the law were to take effect, one of the four state health centers that offers abortion procedures would be forced to close, and the remaining three locations would not be able to "absorb the unmet need." Judge William Conley of the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-abortion-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last month that the law is unconstitutional.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have remained a divisive issue throughout the country. At the end of last month Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. A week earlier the Kansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/kansas-legislature-approves-ban-on-second--trimester-abortion-procedure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] SB 95, a proposed ban on an abortion procedure typically used in second trimester abortions, becoming the first state in the country to do so. Earlier in March the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/aclu-challenges-alabama-law-allowing-fetuses-legal-representation.php">requested</a> [JURIST report], as part of their ongoing suit against the bill, that a federal judge block an Alabama law allowing fetuses legal representation in cases when minors seek abortions. Also in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghanistan women's rights activists are facing increased violence and a lack of governmental support, according to an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/1279/2015/en/">report</a> [materials; <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/afghanistan-women-human-rights-defenders/">press release</a>] published Tuesday. According to AI, female activists face threats, sexual assault, killing of family members, grenade attacks on homes and assassinations. The report outlines how these women and girls "have been targeted not just by the Taliban but by warlords and government officials as well." AI claims that Afghan authorities are ignoring threats against women, that very few investigations are carried out and "prosecutions and convictions [are] even rarer," and that many face stigmatization for their honesty in coming forward with their experiences. Although the <a href="http://www.laoa.af/laws/law_on_eliminaton_of_violence_against_women.pdf">Elimination of Violence against Women</a> (EVAW) [text, PDF] law was passed in 2009, AI says it remains "unevenly enforced," as there is a lack of resources and support allotted to the government bodies and officials charged with protecting women. According to the group, "[t]he culture of harassment in public institutions must be addressed, and the authorities must challenge attitudes which lead to abuses." The report calls for protection (especially in rural areas), prosecutions using appropriate legislation, and no more discrimination in the level of protection. </p>

<p>Afghanistan has been the target of much <a href="/hotline/2009/08/afghanistans-shia-personal-status-law.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] regarding human rights issues. The <a href="http://www.unama.unmissions.org">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-reports-progress-toward-torture-prevention-in-afghanistan.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in February that Afghanistan has made "some progress" toward preventing the torture of government detainees. Last month UNAMA also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] indicating a 22 percent increase in civilian causalities in 2014, making 2014 the deadliest year in Afghanistan since 2009. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-calls-for-protection-of-womens-rights-in-afghanistan.php">called on the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address violence against women in the country. UNAMA and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">released a study</a> [JURIST report] last February that raised concern over the treatment of women in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-153473">ruled</a> [judgment, in French; <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-5056783-6219425">press release</a>] Tuesday that the beating of a 62-year-old man by an Italian police officer during the Genoa G-8 summit in July of 2001 amounted to torture. Arnaldo Cestaro, the injured, was in a school when police stormed the building and, though he was being complicit and surrendering, beat him to the point where he suffered fractures and other injuries. The school was made available by the authorities for use by demonstrators, and the aforementioned act of violence occurred after a police riot squad stormed the building to carry out a search. The court found that "there had been a violation of the Convention on account of acts of torture sustained by the applicant and of the Italian criminal legislation, which was inadequate for the punishment of such acts and not an effective deterrent against their reputation." The ECHR awarded Cestaro €45,000 and urged Italy to change its criminal laws to hold police accountable for such acts.</p>

<p>In November 2008 an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-court-acquits-majority-of-police.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] the majority of police officers involved in other alleged G8 human rights violations. In July 2008 an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-officials-convicted-of-abusing.php">found 15 police force members and medical staff guilty</a> [JURIST report] of abusing the protesters but absolved 30 more. In August 2010 the ECHR <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{"dmdocnumber":["853404"],"itemid":["001-93948"]}">ruled</a> [judgment] that Italy was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/europe-rights-court-rules-2001-italian.php">negligent</a> [JURIST report] in completing an accurate investigation of the death of a protester at the summit. The court awarded €40,000 to the family of Carlo Giuliani, the protester who died after being shot by an Italian police officer as his van was mobbed. On the night of July 21, 2001, police forces conducted a raid on the Diaz school, which was being used as headquarters by some of the protesters. Over the course of the summit as a whole, more than 100 protesters were injured, and one was killed. Immediately after the protests and reports of abuse, Amnesty International <a href="http://antig8.dyne.org/text/amnesty-release.html">called for a full investigation</a> [press release] into the mistreatment. In July 2006 the group urged the Italian government to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news?id=ENGEUR300052006&lang=e">institute reforms to prevent future abuses</a> [press release] but said that the government had not done so in the five years since the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan's <a href="http://www.ihc.gov.pk/">Islamabad High Court</a> (IHC) [official website] on Tuesday issued an order to register a report against former CIA station chief Jonathan Banks for his involvement in a 2009 US drone attack that killed two tribesmen. The court's order was <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/865815/2009-drone-strike-court-directs-police-to-register-case-against-ex-cia-station-chief/">issued in response</a> [Express Tribune report] to anti-drone activist Haji Abdul Karim Khan's petition, filed because his brother and son were killed in the drone strike in the North Waziristan tribal area. The IHC has ordered Inspector General (IG) Islamabad Tahir Alam Khan to file the murder case in two previous hearings, but police did not comply. The court <a href="http://www.pakistanherald.com/news/5280/07-april-2015/ihc-orders-registration-of-fir-against-former-cia-station-chief">dismissed</a> [Pakistan Herald report] the IG's claims that a case would affect foreign policy with the US, and once again ordered the case filed. The IHC also disregarded the Deputy Attorney General's position and a lower court's dismissal on the grounds that the IHC has no jurisdiction over the matter because the drone strike was carried out in the <a href="http://fata.gov.pk/">Federally Administered Tribal Areas</a> [official website].</p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both the international arena and in domestic circles. Last March the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-drone-strikes-should-follow-international-law.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] urging states to comply with international law in the use of armed drone strikes. UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-accountability-transparency-in-use-of-drones.php">called for transparency and accountability</a> [JURIST report] in the use of drones in counter-terrorism operations in his report in October 2013. A joint Human Rights Watch and International Human Rights Clinic <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/arms0514_ForUpload_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] also raised possible threats to human rights, such as the right to life, in law enforcement situations. In the US at the same time, California refused to limit drone use in domestic law enforcement when its governor <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/california-governor-vetoes-drone-use-regulation-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required enforcement agencies to acquire warrants to use drones for surveillance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.mlive.com/lansing-news/other/CourtSORA.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that some requirements of the 1994 <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%2832uag5hc0uizidmlzdl3qj2j%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-295-of-1994">Michigan Sex Offenders Registration Act</a> [text] are so vague that they are unconstitutional. One of these is the requirement that convicted sex offenders stay at least 1,000 feet away from schools. The judge stated that this order leaves offenders to guess as to the distance of 1,000 feet without assistance from the state, which could leave even the most well-intentioned offender in violation of the law. The judge also struck down various other parts of the law, including a requirement that offenders report any new e-mail addresses in person. The ruling also did away with the requirement to update in person any telephone numbers routinely used by the offender. These areas of the law, said the judge, were so vague that it left law enforcers unclear when the reporting requirements were triggered, making it difficult to determine when a law had been violated.</p>

<p>A number of changes in the sex-offender registry system have taken place across the country, as sex offender laws have been increasingly <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-sex-offender-laws-may-do-more-harm.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] over the past decade for limiting residence options and promoting ostracization. Last month the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/california-supreme-court-rules-sex-offender-residential-limits-unconstitutional.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that restrictions on where sex offenders may live violates the parolees' constitutional rights. In February a New York appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/new-york-court-rules-state-sex-offender-law-trumps-municipal-ordinances.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that state laws governing residency restrictions take precedence over municipal ordinances. The <a href="www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/pennsylvania-top-court-strikes-down-law-on-juvenile-sex-offenders.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 5-1 in January that the requirement that all sex offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes must remain on the Megan's Law Registry for life is unconstitutional. In September a divided <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that requiring a sex offender to wear a GPS tracking device after he has completed his sentence violates the federal and state constitutions. In June 2013 the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-upholds-sex-offender-registration-requirements.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government can compel a convicted sex offender to register under the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4905/text">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=SORNA">news archive</a>] even if the offender completed his sentence before SORNA was enacted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in Nairobi on Tuesday ordered five Kenyan citizens and a Tanzanian to be detained for 30 days while authorities investigate possible connections to last week's university massacre. The court <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Five-Kenyans--one-Tanzanian-held-over-university-massacre--court">granted state lawyers' request</a> [AFP report] for the extended detention of the six suspects, which will likely last up to 24 hours before the detainee has to be presented in court. The Tanzanian is still being held in Garissa, where the massacre took place. Lawyers for the police said that the five Kenyan citizens were being investigated for supplying the attackers with weapons but did not give any further details. The Tanzanian citizen, who worked as a security guard on the campus, was found "hiding in the ceiling" of a university building, holding grenades. The five Kenyan citizens were arrested while trying to cross the border to Somalia. Al Qaeda linked militant group Al-Shabaab has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/05/africa/kenya-attack/">claimed responsibility</a> [CNN report] for the attack at Garissa University College, which left 148 people dead. Kenyan authorities are offering a USD $215,000 reward for alleged Al-Shabaab commander Mohamed Mohamud, who is said to be the mastermind behind the university attack. </p>

<p>In February, a former aide of Osama Bin Laden <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bin-laden-aide-found-guilty-of-us-embassy-bombings.php">was convicted</a> [JURIST report] of plotting the 1998 al Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. In June the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/pentagon-approves-war-crimes-trial-for-al-qaeda-leader.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the war crimes trial of Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, a former leader of al Qaeda's army between 2002 and 2004, <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ChargingDocumentsAbdalHadialIraqi20131.pdf">accused</a> [charge sheet, PDF] of killing US service members and funding al Qaeda operations amongst other things. In March 2013 Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of Osama Bin Laden, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] and thereafter indicted in US federal court for plotting to kill Americans. In January 2013 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, Osama bin Laden's media secretary. In October 2012 Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges, including taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups and conspiracy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/261094720/Dallas-Buyers-Club-LLC-v-IiNet-Limited-2015-FCA-317#scribd">ordered</a> [judgment] six Internet service providers (ISPs) to hand over information about alleged illegal downloaders of the US film <em>Dallas Buyer's Club</em>. The case was filed by the US company that owns the rights to the movie as a preliminary discovery application to determine the identity of unknown respondents. The company asserted that it has identified 4,726 unique IP addresses from which the film was illegally shared and downloaded over the BitTorrent website without permission. After the names and addresses of individuals that hold these IP address are received, the company must prove that they committed copyright infringement. Per the judgment, the company must submit to the court a draft of any letter it proposes to send to these individuals. The court referenced the need to provide deterrence of copyright infringement:<blockquote>It is not beyond the realm of possibilities that damages of a sufficient size might be awarded ... in an appropriately serious case in a bid to deter people from the file sharing of films. There is no need to speculate on what those damages might be. For present purposes, it is enough only to observe that the ISPs' submission that what the rights owners have in mind is frivolous or de minimis is a submission which does not afford sufficient weight to the genuine rights which here exist, and which are expressly recognised by statute.</blockquote>Various countries have struggled in recent years with Internet piracy and copyright infringement. In November the founder of file-sharing website The Pirate Bay was <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/pirate-bay-co-founder-arrested-while-entering-thailand.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] when he was trying to cross from Laos into Thailand after he was convicted of aiding copyright infringement. Last April the Senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/brazil-ratifies-bill-on-internet-privacy.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that eliminates ISPs' liability for content published by their users and requires providers to remove offensive materials following court orders. Last March Viacom and Google <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/google-and-viacom-settle-copyright-infringement-suit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a copyright infringement lawsuit that Viacom had filed against Google's YouTube website for allowing clips of Viacom's television programs to be posted without authorization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian lawmakers approved detention without trial in a new anti-terror bill that passed on Tuesday, but human rights groups criticize the bill as a giant step backwards for human rights in the country. The Prevention of Terrorism Act was <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/04/07/malaysia-revives-detention-without-trial-with-new-law">passed</a> [AP report] by the country's Parliament with a 79-60 vote. If approved The new law would allow authorities to detain suspects indefinitely without a trial, and would bar suspects from challenging their detainment in court. The government said the law is needed to fight islamic militants, as dozens of Malaysians have been arrested since 2013 for suspected links to the Islamic State group. However, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called it a "giant step backwards for human rights" in Malaysia, and that it raises concerns that the government will use the law to intimidate vocal critics. "By restoring indefinite detention without trial, Malaysia has re-opened Pandora's Box for politically motivated, abusive state actions that many had thought was closed with the abusive Internal Security Act was revoked in 2012," <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/05/malaysia-scrap-repressive-counterterrorism-bill">said HRW Asia Director</a> [statement] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/phil-robertson">Phil Robertson</a> [official profile]. The bill will need to be approved by the upper house of Parliament and by the King, but those are considered formalities. </p>

<p>In 2013, after arresting some 100 Malaysians suspected of supporting the <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] militant group, the Malaysian government <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/malaysia-pm-proposes-anti-terrorism-law.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] they needed new measures to curb militants. IS has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-investigators-blame-islamic-state-commanders-for-war-crimes-in-syria.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Last month the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights jointly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">released a report </a>[JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. In December the UK-based <a href="http://syriahr.com/en/">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported that the IS <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">executed </a>[JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December. That month the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the groups beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Syria. The Chief Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) stated in November that the ICC is contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/academics/veteranslegalservicesclinic.htm">Veterans Legal Services Clinic</a> [official website] at Yale Law School <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/News_&_Events/Monk_v_McDonald_Mandamus_Petition_FINAL_150406.pdf">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [petition, PDF; <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/news/19493.htm">press release</a>] on Monday on behalf of a Vietnam-war veteran, requesting that the <a href="http://www.va.gov">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official website] promptly adjudicate his pending disability benefits application. The named plaintiff, Conley Monk Jr., is a Marine Corps veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other significant disabilities. Monk's application for benefits was filed shortly after he was diagnosed with combat-related PTSD in 2011. The Hartford, Connecticut VA regional office denied his application, so he timely filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) to appeal the decision. Monday's class action lawsuit asks the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov">US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] to compel the VA Secretary to decide Monk's claim, because of the significant financial and medical hardship he has suffered in the 20 months since his NOD was filed in a timely fashion. Monk, age 66, argues the long wait <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/us/vietnam-veteran-sues-over-delay-in-appeal-on-benefits.html?_r=2">amounts to a denial of benefits</a> [NYT report] and the suit asks the court to compel the VA Secretary to make a decision in the next 30 days. </p>

<p>The VA has been heavily criticized for its inability to provide adequate medical care to veterans, despite efforts from the Obama administration to improve the claim review process. Last month US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/obama-to-announce-committee-to-improve-va.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the creation of a new advisory committee to improve conditions in the VA. The committee will consist of business leaders, members of veteran organizations and health science professionals with a diverse range of experience. In February <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/obama-signs-suicide-prevention-for-veterans-act-into-law.php">Obama signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5059/text">Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act</a> [HR 5059] into law in order to combat increasing suicide rates among American veterans suffering form PTSD. The act was passed by a unanimous Congress and is intended to facilitate veterans' access to mental health resources, as studies have shown that suicide rates are higher among those who do not receive any type of mental health care. In August <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/obama-signs-bill-overhauling-veterans-affairs-department.php">Obama signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.r.4031:">Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014</a> [bill summary] to allow veterans to seek private care outside of VA facilities and provide money for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Anadolu 4th High Criminal Court in Istanbul on Tuesday <a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2015/04/07/turkish-court-acquits-63-defendants-in-sledgehammer-balyoz-military-coup-plot-case">acquitted</a> [<em>Daily Sabah</em> report] the remaining 62 military officers for from an alleged conspiracy to initiate a coup in Turkey in 2003. A lawyer explained the ruling <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/07/us-turkey-court-coup-idUSKBN0MY0PJ20150407">cites inadmissible evidence</a> [Reuters report], notably some of the digital evidence. Allegedly, the digital evidence was rendered useless by significant time-based inconsistencies. Last week an Istanbul court acquitted 236 other officers in connection with the alleged plot, which follows the decision from August 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/turkish-court-orders-retrial-of-hundreds-of-alleged-coup-plotters.php">ordering the release and retrial of 230 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] convicted for their involvement in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sledgehammer+coup">Balyoz (Sledgehammer) coup plot</a> [JURIST news archive]. The scheme, which originated as early as 2003, was aimed at overthrowing former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile], who is now the president of Turkey. </p>

<p>The government of Turkey has been under major international criticism for corruption and potential human rights violations in recent months. Earlier in April a spokesperson for Erdogan announced the imposition of a governmental <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/turkish-prosecutor-orders-blocking-of-social-media-sites.php">order mandating Internet providers to block social networking sites</a> [JURIST report] including Twitter and YouTube. The order stemmed from photos posted on the social media sites that show militant Marxists pointing a gun at a prosecutor who died last week during a shootout between police and the Marxists who were holding him hostage. In February an Egyptian court scheduled a date to evaluate a lawsuit which <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-to-consider-lawsuit-claiming-turkey-a-supporter-of-terrorism.php">claims Turkey is a "state that supports terrorism"</a> [JURIST report] and must be designated as such. The lawsuit alleges Erdogan supported the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] and criticized Egypt after Mohammed Morsi was ousted in July 2013. In January anti-corruption watchdog <a href="http://www.transparency.org">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] criticized a vote by the Turkish Parliament that <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/anti-corruption-group-condemns-turkey-parliament-vote.php">rejected a proposal to lift parliamentary immunity</a> [JURIST report] in a corruption investigation against three ex-ministers and Erdogan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A coalition of human rights groups on Tuesday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/07/venezuela-stop-harassing-human-rights-defenders">urged</a> [press release] Venezuelan authorities to stop intimidating and harassing human rights organizations. According to the groups, the government has employed tactics intended to discredit and undermine the legitimacy of 28 international and Latin American human rights organizations by making allegations that the organizations do not support Venezuelan democracy. Additionally, numerous human rights defenders who have recently flown into Venezuela have reported that they were followed, filmed and searched by unidentified men. Groups stated that, "under international law, governments must ensure that human rights defenders are allowed to pursue their legitimiate activities without reprisals, threats, intimidation, harassment, discrimination, or unnecessary legal obstacles." The groups went on to say that while limitations on freedom of expression may be allowed, countries should adhere to strict standards. </p>

<p>Venezuela has routinely been called out for their human rights abuses. Amnesty International reported last month that Venezuela effectively <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/amnesty-venezuela-allowing-more-abuses-by-failing-to-investigate-2014-protests.php">allows more violence</a> [JURIST report] and abuses through its failure to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the injuries and tortures during 2014 protests. Between February and July 2014, demonstrators gathered to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26676806">protest government authority</a> [BBC news report], resulting in conflict with police and the deaths of 43 people and the injury of 878. In response to the conflict, rights groups criticized <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/hrw-venezuela-security-forces-abusing-protesters.php">Venezuelan security forces</a> of abusing and unlawfully detaining protesters, and <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-venezuela.php">called for an end to violence</a> [JURIST reports] in the country. Such violent demonstrations were partially motivated by Venezuela's current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25745959">economic difficulties</a> [BBC backgrounder] and disdain towards current <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.ve/gobierno_presidente.html">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official website, in Spanish]. In 2013 Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/venezuela-withrdraws-from-international-human-rights-court.php">withdrew</a> from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights despite criticism from activists and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-high-commissioner-asks-venezuela-to-stay-in-human-rights-court.php">calls by the UN</a> [JURIST reports] for the country to remain a member.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/about%20the%20court/Pages/about%20the%20court.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Fatou Bensouda said Wednesday that although the <a href="/feature/2014/11/the-islamic-state.php">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] has been accused of widespread atrocities throughout Iraq and Syria, her office <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/otp-stat-08-04-2015-1.aspx">lacks jurisdiction</a> [statement] to open a formal investigation into the group. Despite allegations of "crimes of unspeakable cruelty," Bensouda said, "Syria and Iraq are not Parties to the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the [ICC]. Therefore, the Court has no territorial jurisdiction over crimes committed on their soil." Bensouda did note that the ICC has the power to exercise personal jurisdiction over individuals who are nationals of a state party but concluded that, "at this stage, the prospects of my Office investigating and prosecuting those most responsible, within the leadership of [IS], appear limited."</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has caused increasing international alarm over its human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">jointly released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. Bensouda stated in November that the ICC was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday dismissed the Argentine government's appeal of a contempt charge in an ongoing dispute over Argentina's bond default in 2001. The contempt charge resulted after Buenos Aires refused to pay two US hedge funds and sought to sidestep a court order that forbids the government from paying only the bondholders it chooses. Judge Thomas Griesa of the <a href="http://nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] declared Argentina in <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/us-judge-declares-argentina-in-contempt-of-court.php">contempt</a> [JURIST report] last September. Griesa's ruling blocked Buenos Aires from making payments to the majority of its bondholders unless it pays out in full to the hedge funds. He will decide next what sanctions to impose. The Second Circuit rejected the appeal as premature. </p>

<p>Last year Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/argentina-passes-law-circumventing-us-court-ruling-limiting-debt-repayments.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill to continue making payments on foreign-held bonds outside of US jurisdiction, circumventing the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-orders-argentina-to-pay-more-than-1-billion-to-investors.php">US court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits Argentina from paying its bondholders until the dispute is resolved. In August Argentina initiated legal proceedings against the US in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] over US interference in the <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/argentina-sues-us-in-international-tribunal-over-debt.php">restructuring of Argentina's foreign debt</a> [JURIST report]. Argentina contends that the US violated its sovereignty and immunities as a result of judicial decisions adopted by US tribunals concerning the restructuring of the Argentine public debt. In June Argentina appealed to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], but the court refused to hear its appeals, <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rejects-argentina-bond-appeal.php">denying <em>certiorari</em></a> JURIST report] in two cases. That same day the court ruled in a related case that a hedge fund can subpoena banks for information about Argentina's non-US assets. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court held that no provision in the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/foreign_sovereign_immunities_act.pdf">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> [text, PDF] immunizes a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor from post-judgment discovery of information concerning its extraterritorial assets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Rita Izsák, called on the countries of the world Wednesday to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50517#.VSU56tzF9yw">focus</a> [press release] on human rights struggles of the Roma people and to take action to end discrimination and racism. Wednesday marks International Roma Day. Izsák urged nations to protect minority rights as set out in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Minorities/Booklet_Minorities_English.pdf">UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities</a> [text, PDF] and asked that media portray the Roma people objectively and avoid sensationalism. She also expressed concern over the lack of adequate governmental representation of Romani people throughout the world, even among organizations designed to protect their rights. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] also reported Wednesday that Roma people are still regarded as inferior throughout Europe, facing <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/the-stunted-education-of-romani-children-in-europe/">challenges</a> [AI report] particularly in education. According to AI many Roma school children are bullied or segregated in schools in European countries, highlighting events in France, Slovakia and Greece. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/203657.htm">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official profile] also released a <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/04/240388.htm">statement</a> [official statement] Wednesday, reaffirming US commitment to equal protection of all Romani people. </p>

<p>International rights groups have consistently campaigned for improved human rights for the Roma people living in Europe. Last year AI released a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/dnp-5.php">report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the chronic prevalence of hate crimes and discrimination perpetrated against the Roma diaspora in Europe. In April 2013 AI also <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rights-group-urges-eu-to-end-discrimination-aginst-roma.php#.U0Qr1xZCe2w">issued</a> [JURIST report] a press release similar urging the EU to end discrimination against Roma communities throughout Europe. That same month, a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rights-group-urges-eu-to-end-discrimination-aginst-roma.php#.U0Qr1xZCe2w">called</a> [JURIST report] for EU member states to do more to ensure basic human rights for the Roma people in Europe recalling that the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] "made nearly 250 recommendations to almost 30 countries concerning the situation of Roma communities." In January 2013 the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/euorpe-rights-court-condemns-hungary-segregation-of-roma-students.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Hungary for segregating Roma students and wrongly placing them in remedial schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/memorandum-opinion-and-order-us-district-judge-andrew-s-hanen/">declined</a> [opinion] Tuesday night to lift an <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.texastribune.org/media/documents/255992850-Order-of-Temporary-Injunction-Texas-v-United-States.pdf">order he issued in February</a> [text, PDF] temporarily blocking the executive immigration actions authorized by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website]. US District Judge Andrew Hanen issued two orders Tuesday night, the first rejecting the government's motion to stay his February injunction, and the <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/us-district-judge-andrew-s-hanen-order/">second</a> [order] alleging that government lawyers had made "misleading" statements regarding the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ff-immigration-hanen-20150407-story.html">granting</a> [LAT report] of 108,000 applications for deferred action under the president's executive action. Texas <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Ken Paxton</a> [official website] praised the court's ruling <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/oagnews/release.php?id=5014">stating</a> [press release] that "The Obama Administration's blatant misrepresentations to the court about its implementation of expanded work permits for illegal immigrants under the President's lawless amnesty plan reflects a pattern of disrespect for the rule of law in America." A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/08/politics/immigration-order-texas-judge-obama/">will hear arguments</a> [CNN report] regarding the injunction blocking the president's executive action on April 17.</p>

<p>In November Obama announced two new <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">immigration programs</a> [text], purportedly under his executive authority as president. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) would lift the threat of deportation for about 4.7 million undocumented residents by allowing immigrants that have been in the US for more than five years or have children who are citizens to register and pass a criminal background check in order to stay in the country. In March the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-urges-appeals-court-to-reverse-ruling-on-immigrant-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Fifth Circuit to reverse the injunction blocking the president's immigration executive action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee was arrested Tuesday in connection with the murder of Ugandan Senior Principal State Attorney Joan Kagezi last month. Ugandan citizen Jamal Kiyemba was <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/former-gitmo-detainee-reportedly-arrested-for-murder-of-ugandan-prosecutor">apprehended</a> [VICE news report] along with three others in the Ugandan Capital of Kampala by a joint operation of the Ugandan Police Force and US military troops. Kiyemba, who was released from Guantanamo in 2006, was first detained in Pakistan in 2002 for suspected links to al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. Kagezi was killed in drive-by shooting while on her way home in March. At the time, she was the lead prosecutor in the trial of 13 men accused of carrying out <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071200476.html">bombing attacks</a> [WP report] in Kampala in 2010 that left more than 80 people dead. </p>

<p>The continued operation of the Guantanamo military prison has sparked considerable controversy and political debate. In February the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pentagon-announces-retraction-of-military-judge-relocation-rule.php">rescinded</a> [JURIST report] a new rule that required military judges presiding over war crimes tribunals at the US Navy base in Guantanamo Bay to relocate to Cuba. In January a US Army prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/Prosecutor-challenges-guantanamo-bay-ban-on-women-guards-touching-inmate.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that a military court order barring female guards at Guantanamo from touching an alleged al Qaeda commander violates Pentagon sex discrimination guidelines. Also in January a defense lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/defense-seeks-to-have-charges-dropped-against-guantanamo-prisoner.php">sought</a> [JURIST report] to have the charges dropped against Guantanamo prisoner and suspected Iraqi al Qaeda commander Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, arguing that the US is violating international law and the Constitution by prosecuting him for war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/kansas-legislature-approves-ban-on-second--trimester-abortion-procedure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Kansas legislature near the end of March. Kansas is the first state to ban this type of procedure, typically used to perform second trimester abortions. A public ceremonial signing of <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/measures/sb95/">SB 95</a> [legislative materials] will take place on April 28. To date, the governor has signed 22 bills into law this session.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have remained a divisive issue throughout the country. This month the Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/wisconsin-ag-appeals-abortion-ruling.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. At the end of March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW sues DEA over mass surveillance program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/hrw-v-dea-complaint">filed suit</a> [complaint] Tuesday accusing the US <a href="http://www.dea.gov/index.shtml">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website] of collecting records of the organization's telephone calls to foreign countries. The DEA <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/08/us-human-rights-watch-sues-over-surveillance">attempted</a> [press release] to make the existence of a mass surveillance program confidential until January, when a federal judge ordered the government to disclose additional information about the program. The purpose of the surveillance program is to collect telephone metadata, including data about the numbers people call and the time, date and duration of those calls. HRW, represented by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy website], has filed a series of legal claims alleging unconstitutional government surveillance. In a declaration filed in the criminal case in January, a DEA agent stated that the program was designed to collect telephone records of calls made from the US to "designated foreign countries" connected with international drug trafficking. There is evidence that the DEA obtained the records without judicial oversight or approval. HRW is seeking to ensure that the program is permanently terminated and that all of HRW's illegally collected records are purged from all government systems. </p>

<p>Government surveillance policies have been hotly debated recently. Much of the focus comes as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former US <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. One of the first challenges to NSA activities came in June 2013, when the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court just days after Snowden claimed responsibility for the leaks. As the outcry over the revelations began to expand in scope and severity, several other human rights groups decided to sue as well. The following month both the EFF and the <a href="https://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> [advocacy websites] filed suit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-surveillance.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] similar claims on the behalf of a coalition of 19 separate organizations. In March France's government pushed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">surveillance bill</a> [JURIST report] that would give French intelligence services the authority to monitor metadata. In February a US district court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-warrantless-surveillance.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to NSA warrantless surveillance. Also in February the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of citizens' Internet use violates human rights law. In July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">UK's Secret Intelligence Service</a> [official website] known as MI6, alleging that the agency accesses data from undersea cables in violation of the rights to private life and freedom of expression. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in two separate decisions that courts cannot prohibit parolees from using medical marijuana when used for medical purposes under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA). The AMMA was passed by the legislature in 2010, and both plaintiffs obtained registry identification cards because of medical conditions for which doctors prescribed marijuana treatment. In <a href="http://supremestateaz.granicus.com/DocumentViewer.php?file=supremestateaz_192e655c39caf4285a7b880f8be3eebe.pdf&view=1">Arizona v. Ferrell</a> [opinion, PDF], Justice Ann Timmer reasoned that courts cannot assume powers which were restricted by the legislature. In this case the court found that the state cannot order the plaintiff to refrain from using medical marijuana as part of a plea agreement. In <a href="http://supremestateaz.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1599">Reed-Kaliher v. Hoggatt</a> [text, PDF], Justice Rebecca Berch wrote the opinion of the court, pointing out that AMMA does not bar drug offenders or offenders of violent crimes from using medical marijuana, and would therefore also not bar probationers. Although courts can impose many restrictions on probationers, these restrictions cannot violate state law. The state argued that Arizona law mandates that drug offenders must be prohibited from marijuana use. However, Berch stated that the AMMA distinguishes between medicinal use and illegal recreational use of the drug. </p>

<p>The legal use and sale of <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for both medical and recreational purposes has become a controversial issue in the US with a number of states contemplating various legalization initiatives. Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman filed a brief last month <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/colorado-asks-supreme-court-to-throw-out-marijuana-case.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to throw out a lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization law. In November voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/residents-in-alaska-oregon-dc-vote-to-legalize-marijuana.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to legalize recreational marijuana. The Pennsylvania State Senate last September <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST Report] legislation that would legalize several forms of medical marijuana. In July Illinois Governor Pat Quinn <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/illinois-governor-signs-bill-expanding-medical-marijuana-for-seizures.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] legislation that will allow adults and children suffering from seizures access to medical marijuana. In April 2014 the Maryland House of Representatives passed a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/maryland-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/memo.2015.04.08.Tunisia%20Counterterrorism%20Law.eng_.pdf">analysis</a> [text, PDF] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] of the Tunisian government's new draft counterterrorism law released Wednesday suggests that the law as drafted could potentially lead to serious human rights abuses. The law would permit extended incommunicado detention, weaken due process guarantees for people charged with terrorism offenses, and allow the death penalty for anyone convicted of a terrorist attack resulting in death. The law became a priority for the Tunisian government after the March 18 terrorist attack at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, and would replace the counterterrorism law currently in force that was adopted in 2003. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/08/tunisia-flaws-revised-counterterrorism-bill">sent</a> [press release] their outlined concerns to the Tunisian legislators with the purpose of encouraging the lawmakers to keep human rights needs at the forefront of their drafting efforts in order to create a successful counterterrorism law. </p>

<p>Tunisia has had a history of human rights violations that was hoped to be reformed by the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/tunisia-adopts-new-constitution.php">passage of a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in January 2014 that offered more expansive freedoms of speech, conscience and religion. The new constitutional rights guaranteed by the constitution compelled HRW to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-tunisia-should-release-those-convicted-in-violation-of-human-rights.php">ask</a> [JURIST report] for further action in the release of prisoners convicted under human rights violations in February of that year. However, the practices that HRW denounced remained in place after the passing of the constitution. In January HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-tunisia-has-failed-to-deliver-justice-for-unlawful-killings-during-uprising.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Tunisia had failed to bring to justice those responsible for the use of excessive force by police during the uprising four years ago. Also in January HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-denounces-conviction-of-tunisia-blogger.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Tunisian government after it sentenced blogger Yassine Ayari to three years in prison for posting criticisms of government officials on Facebook.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/15/04/141187P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt may join a lawsuit that seeks to compel the state of Missouri to unseal details on its execution methods. This decision <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-court-oks-larry-flynts-push-missouri-execution-30142529">reverses</a> [AP report] a lower court ruling that found that the magazine publisher did not have standing to join in the suit. The appeals court found that a lower court's finding that Flynt's "generalized interest" in the suit was not enough to justify his being a part of it came from the application of the wrong legal standard. Flynt <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/07/missouri-flynt-idUSL2N0X40WI20150407">argued</a> [Reuters report] that he has a right to see the sealed records, citing the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Whether Flynt's request to unseal the records is granted will be decided by a federal court in Jefferson City, Missouri. He hopes to that unsealing these dockets will shed light on the state's execution protocol. </p>

<p>The death penalty and the use of alternative drug protocols in lethal injections remain <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">controversial topics</a> [JURIST archive] in both the US and abroad. Earlier this month the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 11-9 to repeal the death penalty. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah the only US state with such an option. Also in March the Alabama House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/alabama-votes-to-keep-execution-drug-suppliers-secret-bring-back-electric-chair.php">voted to keep execution</a> [JURIST report] drug suppliers' names secret and to bring back the use of the electric chair when chemical related lethal injection methods are not available. In February US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/holder-voices-support-for-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">voiced his support</a> [JURIST report] for a moratorium on the death penalty pending a decision by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012315zr_6jgm.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order, PDF] in late January to determine the constitutionality of Oklahoma's three-drug execution protocol.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx">Chaloka Beyani</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15808&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario. The crisis, unless rapidly resolved, "could lead to mass displacement in the wake of heavy and ongoing fighting and airstrikes," according to the human rights expert. The last two weeks have seen more than 540 people killed in the conflict, 311 of which were civilians and 74 of which were children. UN humanitarian agencies estimate that more than 10,000 people have already been displaced. Beyani went on to condemn what seems to be the targeting of internally displaced persons in the air bombing campaign. He predicts that the scale of internal displacement, though currently unclear, will increase significantly in the next few weeks as the conflict continues.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] has sparked major international concern. Earlier this month UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Valarie Amos <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-relief-chief-calls-for-protection-of-yemeni-citizens.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for the safety of civilians in Yemen. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official websites] have also each recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-alarmed-by-rising-civilian-casualties-in-yemen.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilian lives as Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have continued. In March, during an emergency meeting, the UN special envoy to Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-envoy-warns-security-council-that-yemen-nearing-civil-war.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the UN security Council that the situation in Yemen is teetering on the brink of civil war. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-calls-for-reinstatement-of-yemeni-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Yemen to reinstate President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/ToxicWastes/Pages/SRToxicWastesIndex.aspx">human rights and hazardous substances and wastes</a> [official website] Baskut Tuncak on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15804&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15263826">Kazakhstan</a> [BBC backgrounder] to increase protections for individuals who live in toxic areas within the country. Tuncak was on an a 14-day mission, during which he visited several cities and towns within Kazakhstan that are known for pollution. He noted that many several individuals were living near "mounds of hazardous waste," in cities with contaminated air, and near illegal radioactive waste dumpsites. He stated, "[t]hese at-risk populations' right to life, health, housing, and food are undermined, denied or outright violated due to the effects of hazardous contamination in their environment." Although Kazakhstan has passed several measures to improve the environment, including the adoption of numerous international human rights and environmental treaties as well as domestic laws, policies and programs, Tuncak said the government still needs to do more. </p>

<p>Kazakhstan has in recent years drawn international criticism for its human rights record. In November 2012 a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-a-court-in-kazakhstan.php">upheld the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of an outspoken opposition leader accused of inciting dissent in an attempt to overthrow the government. In October 2012 Human Rights Watch claimed that <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">oil workers in the country face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. However, along with its recent policies to help their environment Kazakhstan has made leaps to improve their criminal procedure. In January the Kazakhstan prosecutor general <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kazakhstan-police-now-required-to-read-suspects-rights-when-making-arrest.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the newly adopted criminal procedure code will require police to read suspects their rights when making arrests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tolimir was arrested in Serbia in 2007 and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bosnian-serb-sentenced-to-life-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2012. The appeals chamber overturned some of his convictions but kept most of his convictions in place. The court also upheld Tolimir's life sentence, stating "in light of these genocide convictions alone, the appeals chamber considers that Tolimir's responsibility does not warrant a revision of his sentence."</p>

<p>The Srebrenica massacre has led to the arrest and prosecution of numerous war criminals including former Bosnian Serb general <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ratko+Mladic">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa/html/">Panama Electoral Tribunal</a> [official website, in Spanish] said Wednesday that former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ricardo+martinelli">Ricardo Martinelli</a> [JURIST news archive] will no longer be immune from prosecution, which allows investigations of corruption charges from Martinelli's time in office to begin. The <a href="http://www.organojudicial.gob.pa/">Panama Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] had <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/panama-court-lifts-martinellis-immunity-prosecution-30170973">requested</a> [AP report] the lifting of immunity after unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/panama-supreme-court-opens-corruption-probe-of-former-president.php">voting</a> [JURIST report] in January to appoint a special prosecutor and begin the corruption probe. The court will investigate Martinelli for suspected <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/09/us-panama-martinelli-idUSKBN0N007220150409">crimes against public administration</a> [Reuters report]. The supermarket magnate allegedly inflated contracts worth millions of dollars to purchase food for a government social program. Martinelli has not been in Panama since the court announced its investigation.</p>

<p>In October Panama officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/panama-supreme-court-judge-suspended-over-corruption-charges.php">suspended Alejandro Moncada</a> [JURIST report], a justice of the Supreme Court, over corruption charges and accusations that he profited from his ties with Martinelli. Moncada denied any wrongdoing and also claimed to be a victim of Martinelli's political foe and successor Varela. Voters elected Martinelli president in May 2009 national elections, which were "considered generally free and fair by independent observers" according to a 2010 <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154514.htm">human rights report</a> [text]. However, local elections have been marred by controversy. <a href="http://hrev.org/">Human Rights Everywhere</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish], a non profit organization, described the elections in the Ngobe-Bugle community as "confusing" and ill-timed. Martinelli governed Panama until 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Salvadoran ex-general linked to human rights abuses during El Salvador's civil war in the 1980s was deported from the US on Wednesday. Former General Eugenio Vides Casanova will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32228343">not face charges</a> [BBC report] in El Salvador due to an amnesty law. Vides Casanova was tied to killings and torture committed by soldiers under his command, including the deaths of four US churchwomen in 1980. He has lived in Florida since 1989, but he was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-deports-salvadoran-ex-general-tied-to-1980s-rights-abuses/2015/04/08/5f4e6ba2-de4d-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html">taken into custody</a> [AP report] after the top US immigration court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-immigration-judge-rules-former-el-salvador-general-may-be-deported.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that he should be deported. The court decision was brought under a 2004 law designed to keep accused international human rights abusers from seeking refuge in the US. Vides Casanova argues that El Salvador's military tactics were supported by Washington in the 1980s, as evidenced by the fact he was awarded the US Legion of Merit twice for fighting rebels. He arrived in El Salvador with over 100 other deportees on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Vides Casanova in April 2011 for human rights crimes committed while he served as the country's top military officer. The US brought this case as the first against a foreign military officer who faced immigration charges by a special humans rights office at the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official site]. In February 2012 a federal immigration judge in Florida decided that he could be deported for the crimes. In April of the following year, the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/doj-releases-ruling-ordering-deportation-of-former-el-salvador-general.php">released a revised ruling</a> [JURIST report] ordering his deportation. Vides Casanova has an appeal pending before the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">instituted</a> [JURIST report] a $55 million verdict against the general for allowing human rights abuses to occur in the war. During the <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=199">El Salvador Civil War</a> [CJA backgrounder] more than 75,000 people were killed and 10,000 disappeared from 1980-1992.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A California senate committee on Wednesday <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277">approved a bill</a> [SB 227] that would prohibit parents of school children from citing their personal beliefs as a reason to let the children remain unvaccinated. The proposed legislation, introduced by Senators <a href="http://sd06.senate.ca.gov/">Dr. Richard Pan</a> and <a href="http://sd26.senate.ca.gov/">Ben Allen</a> [official websites], would continue to allow medical exemptions to vaccinations in certain circumstances. The measure passed the Senate health committee by a vote of 6-2, but must pass other legislative hurdles before a possible Senate floor vote. The measure generated a renewed urgency of late, as more than 130 cases of measles were reported in California this year. Proponents argue that the personal belief exemption is putting the community in danger by exposing more children to diseases that are avoidable through immunization. Opponents claim the proposed law disregards parents' rights. </p>

<p>Childhood vaccination and the potential harm of vaccination to children has been a topic of debate in America in recent years. If this legislative passes, California will be the third state to have strict vaccination legislation in place, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx">following Mississippi and West Virginia</a> [NCSL materials]. Much of the vaccination debate revolves around the alleged link between certain vaccines and autism. In January a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-york-vaccination-requirement.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New York state rule barring unimmunized children from public schools. In May 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-on-attorneys-fees-under-vaccine-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that even for an untimely petition filed under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, a petitioner may recover attorney's fees as long as the claim was filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis. In February 2011 the US Supreme Court ruled that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">provides blanket immunity</a> [JURIST report] to vaccine manufacturers from all tort actions filed in state or federal court alleging design defects. The decision was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">consistent with 18 major scientific studies</a> [JURIST op-ed], which have failed to show a link between vaccines and the widely-diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder. In August 2010 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">upheld a decision finding insufficient evidence</a> [JURIST report] to link childhood vaccines and autism in three cases. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chechen immigrant <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/tsarnaev-charging-documents-press-releases">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a> [case materials] was convicted Wednesday on <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/training/pdf/BlankVerdictSlip.pdf">30 federal charges</a> [verdict slip, PDF] relating to the April 2013 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/us/boston-marathon-terror-attack-fast-facts/">Boston Marathon bombings</a> [CNN backgrounder]. The attack, supposedly meant to punish America for perceived harm against Muslims, was perpetrated by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31734557">Tsarnaev</a> [BBC profile] and his brother, Tamerlan, who together placed two pressure-cooker explosive in the crowd near the finish line. Those explosives killed 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, 23-year-old Lingzi Lu and 8-year-old Martin Richard, and injured 260 others. Sean Collier, an MIT security guard, was killed during the brothers' flight from authorities. Tsarnaev was convicted on 12 counts pertaining to the pressure-cooker bombs, three counts of conspiracy, three relating to the Collier shooting, and 12 relating to his flight after Collier's death, including the use of improvised explosives against Massachusetts police. Tsarnaev's defense team, who readily admitted his culpability for the crimes, sought to paint the 21-year-old former college student as a pawn controlled by his brother, in an effort to avoid the death penalty. Tamerlan, Tsarnaev's elder by about seven years, was killed during a shootout with police shortly after the bombings. The jury is expected to decide sentencing early next week. </p>

<p>The Boston Marathon bombing trial began in early March after a number of delays. Earlier that month the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/federal-appeals-court-rejects-motion-to-move-boston-marathon-bombing-trial.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by Tsarnaev to move the trial out of Boston. In January a judge for the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/judge-rejects-plea-for-delay-in-boston-bombing-trial.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a plea by lawyers for Tsarnaev to pause jury selection for his trial due to the attacks in Paris. The judge, in a short ruling, noted that he had given potential jurors a questionnaire to asses whether an impartial jury could be chosen in this case. Earlier in January the jury selection <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/jury-selection-begins-for-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect.php">began</a> [JURIST report] with more than 1,200 potential jurors being called to the federal courthouse for consideration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Pakistan court on Thursday ordered the release of the main suspect in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2008/mumbai_attacks/default.stm">2008 attacks in Mumbai</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+attack">news archive</a>], Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. The order came less than a month after Pakistan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-reorders-detention-of-alleged-mastermind-of-2008-mumbai-attacks.php">reordered his detention</a> [JURIST report]. The court <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-court-suspends-2611-mastermind-zakiur-rehman-lakhvis-detention-order-orders-his-immediate-release/article7085188.ece">suspended</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] his detention under the <a href="http://punjablaws.gov.pk/laws/127.html">Maintenance of Public Order</a> [text] because the evidence provided by the government was deemed "unsatisfactory" by the court. Lakhvi was ordered to pay two surety bonds valued at 1 million rupees each (roughly USD $16,000), prior to his release.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/pakistan-high-court-overturns-release-of-terrorist-suspect.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Lakhvi's release in January. Lakhvi was granted bail in early December, but the government immediately imposed a three-month detention order to keep him in prison. However, Lakhvi appealed this order and was released in late December. Hours after his release, Lakhvi was in <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistani-police-detain-mastermind-of-mumbai-attacks-on-abduction-charges.php">police custody</a> [JURIST report] again for an alleged kidnapping. The latest detention of Lakhvi comes after his January 12 hearing. In 2012, India executed the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/29/timeline-the-trial-of-mohammed-ajmal-kasab/">Mohammad Ajmal Kasab</a> [WSJ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kasab">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Claudio Giardiello, a defendant in a bankruptcy case, opened fire during trial on Thursday, killing three people, including a lawyer and a judge. Giardiello, an Italian businessman being tried for fraudulent bankruptcy, fired at least 13 shots from a gun he sneaked into the <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/corte-di-cassazione/">Palace of Justice</a> [official website, in Italian] in Milan, killing the presiding judge <a href="http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-04-09/chi-era-fernando-ciampi-giudice-ucciso-sparatoria-tribunale-125211.shtml?uuid=AB1KDcMD">Fernando Ciampi</a>, lawyer <a href="http://www.si24.it/2015/04/09/chi-era-lorenzo-alberto-claris-appiani-una-delle-vittime-della-sparatoria-al-tribunale-di-milano/87221/">Lorenzo Alberto Claris Appiani</a> [profiles, in Italian] and one of his co-defendants. A fourth person was found dead inside the building after evacuation, reportedly having suffered a heart attack. Giardiello, who is thought to have sneaked the gun through security using a false ID, brought with him two spare cartridges for his weapon, indicating premeditation in the killings. The suspect fled the courthouse after the shooting and was apprehended in the suburb of Vimercate. The ease with which Giardiello was able to smuggle his gun into the courthouse has brought about questions of lax courthouse security.</p>

<p>US judges and court administrators have also been increasingly focused on <a href="http://www.ncsc.org/sitecore/content/microsites/future-trends-2012/home/better-courts/1-1-courthouse-security-incidents.aspx">security issues</a> [NCSC report] following a spate of <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/man-who-committed-suicide-in-wisconsin.php">attacks</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/suspected-pipe-bomb-explodes-outside.php">bombings</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/ny-man-arrested-for-threatening.php">threats</a> [JURIST reports] directed at judges, their families and their workplaces in recent years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Alabama state representative <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/Representative.aspx?OID_SPONSOR=85923&OID_PERSON=6661">Teri Collins</a> [official website] has proposed a <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/SESSBillResult.ASPX?BILL=HB405&WIN_TYPE=BillResult">bill</a> [HB 405] to abortion once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. If approved, opponents argue the bill could ban most abortions. Nikema Williams, vice president of public policy for <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] Southeast has called the bill "unreasonable, dangerous and blatantly unconstitutional," and noted that it would be the most restrictive abortion law in the country if passed. Alabama law currently bans abortions 20 weeks or more into a pregnancy, but fetal heartbeats can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The Alabama House of Representatives approved similar legislation last year, but it did not get a vote in the Alabama Senate. Prospects are uncertain for passage this year.</p>

<p>Abortion continues to be a hotly debated legal issue throughout the US, with a number of states proposing laws to limit <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. This week Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback </a>[official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. Earlier this month Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/wisconsin-ag-appeals-abortion-ruling.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International </a> (AI) [advocacy website] said Thursday that it has evidence showing that Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine killed several captured government soldiers in severe violation of international humanitarian law. According to AI, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/ukraine-new-evidence-of-summary-killings-of-captured-soldiers-must-spark-urgent-investigations/">there are pictures</a> [AI report] showing bullet wounds to the heads and bodies of four Ukrainian soldiers who were confirmed dead. Over the past year it has been estimated that hundreds of Ukrainian troops have been captured by rebel forces and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32228336">nearly 6,000 have died</a> [BBC report] as a result of the war. Earlier this week Arseniy Pavlov, a rebel unit commander, admitted to the <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/">Kyiv Post</a> [media website] via a telephone interview that he personally shot 15 Ukrainian servicemen to death. AI will seek to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators responsible for the deaths. Denis Krivosheev, deputy director at Amnesty International for Europe and Central Asia, said "the torture, ill-treatment and killing of captured, surrendered or wounded soldiers are war crimes."</p>

<p>The crisis between Russia and eastern <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ukraine">Ukraine has intensified</a> [JURIST news archive] over the past few months with no sign of a resolution in sight. Though <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">some progress has been made</a> [BBC timeline] after the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed rebels agreed to a cease-fire deal in February brokered by Western leaders in Belarus. Earlier this month Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ukraine-president-agrees-to-allow-referendum-on-expanded-autonomy-in-rebel-controlled-east.php">announced that</a> [JURIST report] the Ukrainian government would no longer object to allowing a referendum that could grant greater autonomy to the eastern regions of the country controlled by Russian-backed rebels. In March <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the Ukrainian government and Russia-backed rebel forces <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-ukraine-government-rebels-using-cluster-munitions.php">consistently used cluster</a> [JURIST report] munitions in eastern Ukraine in early 2015, killing close to 13 civilians, including two children. Last October AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-atrocities-in-eastern-ukraine-must-be-investigated.php">documented extra-judicial killings</a> [JURIST report] by both pro-Russian separatists and pro-Kyiv forces in eastern Ukraine, though the advocacy group cautioned that the actual number of deaths might not be an accurate figure as reported by the Russian media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Obama administration on Wednesday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/08/petition-response-conversion-therapy">voice support</a> [press release] for banning sexual orientation conversion therapy on minors in response to an <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/enact-leelahs-law-ban-all-lgbtq-conversion-therapy">online petition</a> [text] with more than 120,000 signatures. Conversion therapy is practiced by medical health providers with the goal of changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The practice has been used on minors, who opponents argue do not have the ability to make their own medical and mental health decisions. The White House stated that the practice "is neither medically or ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm." The <a href="http://www.psychiatry.org/">American Psychiatric Association</a> (APA) [official website] opposes conversion therapy, stating in 1998 that "such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes." The APA declassified homosexuality from a mental disorder more than 40 years ago. The petition began in January on the White House website days after transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn committed suicide. Leelah had been taken by her parents to conversion therapy sessions before her suicide. California, New Jersey and the District of Columbia  have banned the practice, while 18 other states have introduced legislation banning conversion therapy. <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-iowa-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy.php">Oregon and Iowa lawmakers </a> [JURIST report] have approved similar legislation. A federal ban would require congressional action. </p>

<p>In September the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-jersey-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">upheld a ban</a> [JURIST report] on sexual orientation conversion therapy in New Jersey. The lawsuit was filed by two licensed therapists, among others, who practice "sexual orientation change efforts." In 2013 the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy-ban.php">upheld California's law</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting licensed therapists from counseling minors with the intent to convert their sexual orientation from gay to straight. California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed the bill</a> [JURIST report] in 2012, making California the first state to pass a law banning this type of therapy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2015/04/09/mind-gap-0">released a report</a> [text] entitled "Mind the Gap: The Lack of Accountability for Killer Robots." The report analyzes the hurdles involved in holding anyone (programmers, manufacturers, and military personnel) accountable for deaths caused by fully autonomous weapons, or "killer robots," that require little to no "meaningful human control." HRW contends that individuals associated with the use or production of these weapons may escape liability, as "neither criminal law nor civil law guarantees adequate accountability for individuals directly or indirectly involved in the use of [killer robots]. ... These weapons have the potential to commit criminal acts for which no one could be held responsible," as a weapon cannot possess the intent required by law and does not fall in the "natural person" jurisdiction of international courts.<blockquote>Human commanders or operators could not be assigned direct responsibility for the wrongful actions of a fully autonomous weapon, except in rare circumstances when those people could be shown to have possessed the specific intention and capability to commit criminal acts through the misuse of fully autonomous weapons. In most cases, it would also be unreasonable to impose criminal punishment on the programmer or manufacturer, who might not specifically intend, or even foresee, the robot's commission of wrongful acts.</blockquote>Problems may also arise in the real-life use of "killer robots," as "there are ... grave doubts that [killer robots] would ever be able to replicate human judgment and comply with the legal requirement to distinguish civilian from military targets."</p>

<p>HRW argued last May that the use of fully autonomous weapons by militaries or law enforcement would be an affront to basic human rights and should be <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/hrw-autonomous-weapons-should-be-banned-by-international-convention.php">preemptively banned by international convention</a> [JURIST report]. Later in May, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/un-concludes-first-multilateral-meeting-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons-systems.php">concluded the first multilateral meeting on lethal autonomous weapons systems</a> [JURIST report] where key issues were discussed surrounding the use and implementation of such devices. Last year HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/rights-group-encourage-un-to-address-killer-robots.php">encouraged action</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of UN members at the upcoming 2013 <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/0D4B67A1E11A22BCC1257A410052DE38?OpenDocument">Convention for Conventional Weapons</a> (CCW) [UN website] in support of France's initiative to add fully autonomous weapons to the CCW's work program for 2014. In 2012 the US was the first country to issue a <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300009p.pdf">governmental policy statement</a> [text, PDF] on the use of partially and fully-autonomous weapons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Cambodian lawmakers on Thursday voted by an overwhelming margin to approve a new electoral commission that promises to ensure fairness in the next national vote in 2018. The vote came after opposition leader Sam Rainsey criticized the electoral commission for being biased and disputed the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23462310">2013 election results</a> [BBC report], which sparked a political crisis and mass demonstrations. The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/cambodian-lawmakers-appoint-electoral-body-053234313.html">new commission</a> [AP report] is made up of four members of Rainsey's <a href="http://www.nationalrescueparty.org/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP) [party website, in Khmer], four from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23257699">Prime Minister Hun Sen's</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.cpp.org.kh/">Cambodian People's Party</a> (CPP) [party website, in Khmer] and one neutral slot reserved for the head of an independent electoral watchdog group. Hun Sen's party has been in power for nearly three decades and allegedly intimidates opposition groups. The legislation needs to be passed by the Senate, but that is considered a formality. </p>

<p>Cambodia has had a history of human rights abuses which have continued to alarm rights organizations around the world. Cambodia's <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/cambodia-passes-controversial-new-election-laws.php">Parliament passed two controversial new election laws</a> [JURIST report] in March that rights groups are criticizing as ill-conceived and potentially damaging to free speech. The laws represent a compromise between the CPP and the CNRP in an effort to avoid the kind of political gridlock that resulted from the July 2013 reelection of Prime Minister Hun Sen, in which the CNRP refused to sit in parliament for a year. The laws are being criticized for instituting heavy fines and imposing bans against NGOs that are critical of political parties during the 21-day campaign period. In January Cambodian General Sao Sohka <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodian-commander-admits-to-using-force-against-political-opposition.php">admitted to using force</a> [JURIST report] against political opponents of the CPP. Earlier in January the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-restarts-genocide-hearings.php">restarted genocide hearings</a> [JURIST report] against the former Khmer Rouge regime's surviving leaders. Proceedings had been postponed since November, when <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trial-postponed-to-january.php">defense lawyers refused to participate </a>[JURIST report] because they were still working to appeal an earlier verdict</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15810&LangID=E">criticized Malaysia's proposed anti-terrorism law</a> [press release], known as the <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/parliament-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law-79-to-60-votes">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a> [<em>Malaysian Insider</em> report]. Zeid said that the proposed law threatens freedom of expression and would breach international human rights obligations. The act would amend Malaysia's <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%201/Act%2015.pdf">Sedition Act of 1948</a> [text], which has also been the subject of substantial international criticism. The proposed law would <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/malaysia-lawmakers-approve-detention-without-trial-with-new-anti-terror-bill.php">approve detention without trial</a> [JURIST report], allowing authorities to detain suspects indefinitely, and it would bar suspects from challenging their detainment in court. The government argues the law is needed to fight Islamic militants, as dozens of Malaysians have been arrested since 2013 for suspected links to the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-investigators-blame-islamic-state-commanders-for-war-crimes-in-syria.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Earlier this week, the chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/about%20the%20court/Pages/about%20the%20court.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], Fatou Bensouda, said that although IS has been accused of widespread atrocities throughout Iraq and Syria, the ICC prosecutor's office <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">lacks jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to open a formal investigation into the group. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=943:un-assistance-mission-for-iraq&Itemid=637&lang=en">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</a> (UNAMI) and the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">jointly released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in Spain decided on Friday that genocide charges against seven former and current Moroccan officials, who are accused of committing torture and killings in the Western Sahara from 1975-91, are justified. In his ruling, Judge Pablo Ruz asked that the men be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/spain-judge-moroccan-officials-genocide-30220474">extradited</a> [AP report] to Spain to face a trial. According to his ruling, some of the victims have Spanish identification cards because they lived in Western Sahara while it was still a Spanish colony. The ruling said victims were beaten, burned, electrocuted and sexually assaulted by Moroccan officials after Spain left the colony and Morocco annexed it and began fighting against the pro-independence group <a href="http://www.saharalibre.es/">Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro</a> (Polisario Front) [advocacy website, in Spanish]. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Maria did not comment on whether they would seek extradition of the officials, who include current security officers. </p>

<p>Morocco has occupied the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara, native home to the Sahrawi, since 1975. Polisario has encouraged the expansion of the presence of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minurso/index.shtml">UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara </a>(MINURSO) [official website] in the region, especially for human rights monitoring, but <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-claims-of-abuse-in-western-sahara-by-morocco-exaggerated.php">Morocco has opposed any such plans as infringements on its sovereignty</a> [JURIST report]. Only 45 UN member states currently recognize the autonomy of the Western Sahara state, known as Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), even in a limited capacity. SADR is not recognized by the UN, although it has approved more than 100 resolutions supporting the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people. In 1991 the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Counci</a>l [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/690%281991%29">established </a>[SC resolution, PDF] MINURSO in accordance with the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/22464">Secretary General's plan for the implementation of the settlement</a> [report, PDF] between Morocco and Polisario. In April the Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47681&Kw1=MINURSO&Kw2=&Kw3=#.VSfl42aosZL">extended MINURSO's mission</a> [UN News Centre report] through April 30, 2015, as no referendum on the independence of SADR has yet been held.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/">Parliament of Malaysia</a> [official website, in Malay] on Friday announced a change to the country's sedition law, which will strengthen government intervention upon seditious activity. Malaysia's original <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29373164">sedition law</a> [BBC backgrounder] banned acts and speech expressing contempt against the government or any of Malaysia's royal sultans and called for violators to pay fines or face prison sentences up to three years in duration. Under the strengthened law, the government is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/10/us-malaysia-lawmaking-sedition-idUSKBN0N10AD20150410">permitted to block online content deemed seditious</a> [Reuters report] as well as impose mandatory prison sentences lasting between three and seven years. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">criticized the tougher law</a> [press release] before the parliamentary vote, stating "[i]t is very disappointing that the Malaysian Government is now proposing to make a bad law worse." Suspects charged with sedition will now be prevented from leaving the country and the courts will be faced with the choice of whether to release suspects on bail.</p>

<p>Countries around the world have struggled to balance citizens' internationally-recognized right to free speech with domestic and international security concerns. Last week a Malaysia political cartoonist was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/malaysia-political-cartoonist-charged-with-sedition-over-tweets.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with nine counts of sedition over tweets criticizing the country's judiciary. In March Malaysian officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/daughter-of-malaysia-opposition-leader-arrested-for-sedition.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] the daughter of jailed opposition leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16440290">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile] for alleged acts of sedition. She was reportedly arrested and detained specifically for a speech she made criticizing the jailing of her father. Anwar Ibrahim's conviction on sodomy charges was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/malaysia-top-court-upholds-opposition-leaders-sodomy-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in February, as was his five-year prison sentence. Many critics in Malaysia and abroad have claimed the arrest is a politically driven act to fight the opposing potential threat of the People's Justice party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rights groups take UK government to European Human Rights Court over mass surveillance</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] revealed on Friday that the group, along with other prominent human rights organizations, has submitted an <a href="/paperchase/IOR6014152015ENGLISH.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], bringing claims of indiscriminate surveillance practices against the UK government. The decision to formally challenge the UK government stems from information obtained from by whistle-blower <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23768248">Edward Snowden</a> [BBC timeline] which showed the bulk collection, retention, and sharing of communications happening both in the UK and the US. After receiving this information, AI filed a claim with <a href="http://www.ipt-uk.com">Investigatory Powers Tribunal</a> (IPT) [official website] which dismissed the charges as compliant with human rights, after holding several closed-door sessions with the government. The current action filed with the ECHR asserts that UK law governing intelligence agencies' interception of communications, and its intelligence sharing practices with the US violates the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] which protects the human rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination. The government has responded saying that mass information gathering is a legitimate tool needed for the protection of citizens. Rights groups claim that national security interests cannot override citizens' fundamental right to privacy. </p>

<p>The concern over mass governmental surveillance reached international saliency after the <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">declarations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] made by former <a href="https://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] employee <a href="/feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST backgrounder], who released allegedly confidential documents purported to reveal the scope of NSA surveillance activities. In the days following Snowden's announcement, several human rights organizations chose to bring suit against the NSA. The first to do so was the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">challenged the NSA's surveillance activities</a> [JURIST report] based on the First and Fourth Amendments. A <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-surveillance.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> [advocacy website] closely followed, which included actions based on alleged violations of Fifth Amendment rights. The fight against mass surveillance and the human rights violations that ensue continue today. In February, the IPT <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of internet activities violates human rights law. Just last month, a coalition of human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">brought suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA's mass surveillance programs, with claims of violating privacy rights and threatening free communication. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a unanimous vote on Friday, <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">Pakistani lawmakers</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/resolution_detail.php?id=196">resolution</a> [text] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Saudi Arabia is leading the campaign against Shia Houthi rebels in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive], and had anticipated assistance from its longstanding Sunni ally. Pakistani lawmakers decided the nation should stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Saudi Arabia, offering diplomatic assistance to defuse the conflict and potential military assistance if Saudi Arabia's borders are compromised or holy cities Mecca and Medina are threatened. Despite Saudi Arabia's considerable <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-pakistan-saudi-idUSBREA2C13G20140313">economic contribution</a> [Reuters report] to Pakistan last year, Pakistan chose neutrality, likely in an effort to maintain relations with Iran, which controls energy resources in the area. At least 643 people have been killed and thousands more injured since the beginning of the conflict last year. </p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked major international concern. Earlier this month, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario. Also this month, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Valarie Amos <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-relief-chief-calls-for-protection-of-yemeni-citizens.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for the safety of civilians in Yemen. Human Rights Watch and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have also each recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-alarmed-by-rising-civilian-casualties-in-yemen.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilian lives as Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have continued. In March, during an emergency meeting, the UN special envoy to Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-envoy-warns-security-council-that-yemen-nearing-civil-war.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the UN security Council that the situation in Yemen is teetering on the brink of civil war. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-calls-for-reinstatement-of-yemeni-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Yemen to reinstate President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/index.aspx">Oklahoma state senate</a> [official website] passed <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2015-16%20ENGR/hB/HB1879%20ENGR.PDF">a bill</a> [HB 1879, PDF] on Thursday that would allow for the use of nitrogen gas in executions if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court </a>[official website], or if the drugs become unavailable. If signed by <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website], Oklahoma would be the first state in the nation to execute inmates with nitrogen gas. Under the new method, nitrogen would be delivered via face mask, depriving the inmate of oxygen. Under current Oklahoma law, the state is compelled to use the electric chair if lethal injection is unavailable. The third option is a firing squad. Opponents of the bill have voiced concern that the nitrogen gas method is untested, and some states have banned its use to put animals to sleep. Executions in Oklahoma have been put on hold while the US Supreme Court considers <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], a case determining whether the state's three-drug method of lethal injection violates the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_viii">Eighth Amendment's</a> [text] prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. </p>

<p><a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST archive] and execution methods have been at the forefront of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Earlier this month the Delaware Senate<a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php"> voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty and the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed. Also last month <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-state-attorneys-general-ask-supreme-court-to-ban-oklahoma-execution-drug-cocktail.php">more than a dozen</a> [JURIST report] former state attorneys general asked the US Supreme Court to rule Oklahoma's use of the three-drug execution cocktail unconstitutional. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="http://www.cair.com/images/pdf/yemensuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Thursday on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official websites] for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The rights groups <a href="https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/12930-arab-muslim-and-asian-groups-to-file-lawsuit-to-assist-us-citizens-stuck-in-yemen.html">held a public news conference</a> [press release] outside the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] before the lawsuit was filed. The lawsuit calls for an evacuation of all known US citizens in Yemen "by all means available." CAIR and ADC also created <a href="http://www.stuckinyemen.com/">Stuckinyemen.com</a> [website] to aid in identifying US citizens still in Yemen. The State Department issued a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/yemen-travel-warning.html">travel warning</a> on April 3, which urged US citizens, "to defer travel to Yemen and for those US citizens currently living in or visiting Yemen to depart," and included a link to <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/YemenCrisis.html">information</a> [official website] regarding the Yemen crisis.  </p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] has sparked major international concern. On Wednesday a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen. Earlier this month UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Valarie Amos <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-relief-chief-calls-for-protection-of-yemeni-citizens.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for the safety of civilians in Yemen. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official websites] have also each recently <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-alarmed-by-rising-civilian-casualties-in-yemen.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilian lives as Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have continued. In March, during an emergency meeting, the UN special envoy to Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-envoy-warns-security-council-that-yemen-nearing-civil-war.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the UN security Council that the situation in Yemen is teetering on the brink of civil war. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/">Idaho State Legislature</a> [official website] on Friday voted to kill legislation that would have brought the state into compliance with federal guidelines on the collection of child support. Legislators were <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/local/capitol-watch/2015/04/10/child-support-collection-idaho/25609377/">concerned</a> [AP report] that the bill would force Idaho to enforce child support rulings made in foreign tribunals, particularly those enforcing Islamic law, under the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/upload/conventions/txt38en.pdf">Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance</a> [text, PDF]. The Convention is a treaty to assist signatory parties enforce judicial decisions regarding child support and spousal support extraterritorially. US President Barack Obama signed <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43109.pdf">implementing legislation</a> [PDF] in September of 2014, although the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2014/09/232337.htm">signed the convention</a> [press release] with its original passage in 2007.</p>

<p>Several US states in recent years have <a href="/forum/2015/03/steven-schwinn-sharia-law.php">adopted laws</a> intended to prevent the use or enforcement of foreign law, particularly <a href="/dateline/2013/10/elizabeth-mohamad-sharia-law.php">Sharia (or Islamic) law</a> [JURIST op-eds]. In November, Alabama voters <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/alabama-voters-approve-prohibition-against-foreign-law.php">passed the Foreign Laws in Court Amendment One</a>, a ballot measure that prohibits courts from applying "any law, rule or legal code system used outside of the United States or the State of Alabama." In August of 2013, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory allowed a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/north-carolina-governor-allows-anti-sharia-bill-to-become-law.php">prohibits North Carolina judges from considering Islamic law</a> [JURIST report] in their decisions to become law. In March of 2012, the Florida House of Representatives approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/florida-house-approves-bill-outlawing-use-of-religious-and-foreign-law.php">ban the use of religious or foreign law</a> [JURIST report] in legal decisions and contracts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) [official website] on Friday released an <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2015_14_f_sign.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] on Greece's draft law prohibiting the foreclosure of primary residences. Under the draft law, banks are prohibited from auctioning primary residences valued at less than &#8364;300,000 (USD $317,580), provided that borrowers meet certain total wealth requirements. The draft law is intended to replace Greece's recently-expired <a href="/paperchase/288-2013/document.pdf">foreclosure law</a> [PDF], which provided protections for homes valued at &#8364;200,000 (USD $211,720) or less, along with less generous total wealth requirements. The ECB expressed in its opinion that the increase in scope for eligible debtors could incentivize unscrupulous debtors to engage in strategic defaults, or simply cease paying their home loans with no repercussions to inspire payment. </p>

<p>The 2012 Greek bailout was one of the most dramatic events in the country's recent history and it had a serious effect on the country's economic stability. Last month, Greece's Hellenic Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/greece-parliament-passes-anti-poverty-bill.php">passed an anti-poverty bill</a> [JURIST report], despite requests from international creditors to hold off on the vote until they had time to assess its budgetary impact. In February, Euro zone finance ministers <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/eu-finance-ministers-agree-to-extend-greece-bailout.php">agreed to extend Greece's financial rescue</a> [JURIST report] by four months. In May 2013 a report by UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights Cephas Lumina found that the conditions of Greece's bailout plan, put in place by its international lenders, had <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-warns-greece-bailout-measures-compromising-human-rights.php">severely undercut the ability of Greek citizens to obtain a standard of living</a> [JURIST report] in line with international human rights standards. In January 2013 Greece's Hellenic Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/greece-parliament-approves-new-tax-legislation.php">approved new tax legislation</a>  [JURIST report] enabling the country to pay back its loans and continue receiving financial aid. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/15/04/141520P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] against portions of a Missouri <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills131/billpdf/commit/HB0701C.PDF">law</a> [text, PDF] which required those providing health plan advice to obtain a license from the state, concluding that the licensing portions of the state law are pre-empted by the <a href="https://democrats.senate.gov/pdfs/reform/patient-protection-affordable-care-act-as-passed.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text]. The advocacy groups challenging Missouri's law, the Health Insurance Marketplace Innovation Act (HIMIA), contended that by enacting such a restrictive law, state lawmakers violated the ACA's preemption clause which prohibits states from taking actions that would "'hinder or impede' implementation of the ACA." Proponents of the licensing requirement <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-blocks-missouris-limits-on-health-law-advisers-1428701000">rested their arguments</a> [WSJ report] in favor of the HIMIA on protection of consumers from potential defective advice and identity theft. The court remanded the case to the district court for further development in accordance with its findings in favor of the advocacy groups that challenged the law.</p>

<p>Comprehensive <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was passed by Congress in March 2010 after over a year of debate, and recent legal challenges have reinvigorated debate. The <a href="http://www.ncsl.org">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> (NCSL) [official website] <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-laws-and-actions-challenging-ppaca.aspx">reports</a> [NCSL statistics] that between 2010 and 2015, at least twenty-one states enacted laws attempting to challenge or completely opt out of mandatory provisions of the ACA. In early March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral arguments for <u>King v. Burwell</u> in which the court was asked to rule on whether the <a href="http://www.irs.gov">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] may adopt regulations to extend tax-credit subsidies to coverage purchased through the federal health insurance exchange established under the ACA. Last June the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that closely held corporations can deny contraceptive coverage to their employees for religious reasons. Two weeks after the Hobby Lobby decision, US Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Mark Udall (D-CO)<a href="/paperchase/2014/07/us-senators-introduce-bill-to-restore-full-contraception-coverage-for-employees.php"> introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore full contraception coverage for employees of closely held corporations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian criminal court on Saturday sentenced US citizen Mohamed Soltan to life in prison for supporting the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] and for transmitting false news. Soltan, who was arrested in 2013 and staged a hunger strike while in prison, is a citizen of both the US and Egypt. Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata, who <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/11/us-egypt-court-brotherhood-idUSKBN0N206A20150411">handed down</a> [Reuters report] Soltan's life sentence and sentenced 14 other members of the Brotherhood to death, addressed reporters regarding Soltan's sentence, stating, "He deserves the punishment because of the money and instructions from the Brotherhood which were found with him, and for spreading chaos and horror in society." Soltan and the 14 men sentenced to death, including Muslim Brotherhood leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=badie">Mohamed Badie</a> [JURIST news archive], have the option to appeal their sentences to Egypt's highest civilian court. A relative to Soltan, Sara Mohamed, said the Soltan family plans to appeal. </p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Late last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] 68 people, including members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state. In February An Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death, along with 14 others to life in prison. The individuals were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges, after clashes near the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, which occurred just days before the ouster of Morsi. Also in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] on bail of two Al Jazeera journalists being retried on terror charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN announced on Saturday that the Commissioner General of the <a href="https://www.unrwausa.org/">UN Relief and Works Agency</a> (UNRWA) [official website] will <a href="http://unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/urgent-mission-yarmouk-unrwa-commissioner-general-pierre-kr%C3%A4henb%C3%BChl">make an urgent trip</a> [press release] to Yarmouk, a Syrian refugee camp that has fallen under control of the Islamic State (IS). According to UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness, the visit is prompted by the organization's "deepening concerns for the safety and protection of some 18,000 Palestinian and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children, as Yarmouk remains under the control of armed groups, and as civilian lives continue to be threatened by the effects of the armed conflict in the area." Commissioner General Pierre Krähenbühl will meet with the Syrian government "to exchange views on  peaceful approaches to addressing the humanitarian consequences of the situation in Yarmouk. He will also consult with other UN members to address peaceful resolutions to the conflict. The UNRWA reports that refugees' access to food, water, and medication has been cut off since militants from the Islamic State took control on April 1st. UN workers have been unable to deliver humanitarian aid and supplies to the camp. Residents of Yarmouk are reportedly surviving on only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/world/middleeast/un-official-visits-syria-to-press-urgency-of-besieged-yarmouk-refuge-camp.html?_r=0">400 calories</a> [NYT report] a day, and are short on medical care. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has caused increasing international alarm over its human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Last month the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR jointly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. Bensouda stated in November that the ICC was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters, but said last week that her office <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">lacks jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to open a formal investigation into the group. In February IS led suicide bombings in eastern Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/islamic-state-kills-40-in-suicide-bombing.php">killing</a> [JURIST report] at least 40 people and injuring 70 more. UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported in December that the IS <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Islamist opposition leader Muhammad Kamaruzzaman was executed in Bangladesh on Saturday for war crimes committed in 1971 during the nation's war of independence. Kamaruzzaman, who was one of the highest-ranking officials in the Islamist <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> party [party website], was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-hangs-top-islamist-leader-1971-war-massacre-164949632.html">convicted of</a> [AFP report] committing torture, abduction and mass murder, including the killing of 120 unarmed farmers in the village of Sohagpu. Kamaruzzaman's attorneys argued that, at 19 years old, he was too young to be held accountable for the crimes. Investigation into crimes committed during the country's war of independence began in 2010 and led to the convictions of eight former officials, who have also been sentenced to death. While many in Bangladesh support Kamaruzzaman's sentence, some critics believe that the execution is politically motivated. UN experts had previously <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15260&LangID=E#">urged</a> [press release] Bangladesh to halt the execution. Shortly before the execution, the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] commended Bangladesh for the "judicial rigor" that was applied to this ruling, but  <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/04/240591.htm">urged</a> [press release] the country not proceed with the execution until the country's justice system can achieve fairness and transparency, and meets international standards.</p>

<p>After the 2010 investigation, Muhammad Kamaruzzaman and other Islamist party leaders were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-indicts-islamic-party-leader.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in June 2012, and convicted in 2013. In November the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/web/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/bangladesh-supreme-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-islamist-politician.php">upheld </a> [JURIST report] the death sentence. In March, Kamaruzzaman filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/bangladesh-war-crimes-convict-appeals-death-sentence.php">review petition</a> [JURIST report] with the country's apex court, urging the court to acquit him of the charges. Earlier this month, a Bangladeshi appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/bangladesh-appeals-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-convicted-war-criminal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] his final appeal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] addressed the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/">13th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice</a> [official website] in Doha, Qatar on Sunday and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50552#.VSsZ2PnF83m">highlighted</a> [UN news report] the crucial connection between the rule of law and sustainable development. The Congress also adopted the Doha Declaration which highlights important aspects of fighting global organized crime, how countries can prevent crime and strengthening criminal justice systems. In his speech, Ban stated: <blockquote>All societies need fair criminal justice systems, effective, accountable institutions, and access to justice for all... Accountable security services can go a long way toward ending cycles of violence. Strengthening legal rights helps address inequalities... There can be no sustainable development without human rights and the rule of law... This September, Member States will consider a post-2015 development agenda that can pave the way to a better future for billions of people. Success requires that the new agenda and sustainable development goals reflect the centrality of the rule of law.</blockquote> Ban also noted that international cooperation is critical in achieving these goals, especially stopping organized crime and terrorism.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/about.shtml">Crime Congress</a> [UN backgrounder] runs through April 19 and takes place a few months before an important summit on the future global development agenda that will occur in September.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kenyan government announced on Sunday that it asked the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> [official website] to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees by July. The request comes in the wake of the Garissa University massacre, an <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/5-kenyans-1-tanzanian-detained-over-kenya-university-massacre.php">attack</a> [JURIST report] by Shebab insurgents that left nearly 150 dead. A statement released by the Kenyan government included statements by Vice President <a href="http://www.deputypresident.go.ke/">William Ruto</a> [official website]. "We have asked the UNHCR to relocate the refugees in three months, failure to which we shall relocate them ourselves," he <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kenya-asks-united-nations-to-repatriate-somali-refugees-after-garissa-massacre-754342">said</a> [Agence France-Presse report]. He also compared the attacks to the September 11th attacks, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/11/africa/kenya-dadaab-refugee-camp/">stating</a> [CNN report], "The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa." When asked about the request, the agency stated that it has not yet received the request, but noted that the refugees cannot be involuntarily repatriated. </p>

<p>Somalia has struggled to stabilize after the collapse of its government in 1991. In the words of JURIST Guest Columnist Stoyan Panov, <a href="/forum/2014/09/stoyan-panov-transitional-constitutions.php">Somalia had been ravaged by an endemic, wide-spread internal conflict</a> [JURIST op-ed] for more than 20 years. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in April 2014 urged Somali authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-urges-death-penalty-moratorium-in-Somalia.php">place a moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] after the execution of a man nine days after he allegedly murdered a town elder. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees released a report in March detailing the asylum trends in industrialized countries in 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-report-shows-increase-in-asylum-claims-to-industrialized-countries.php">indicating that Somalia was a top ten refugee origination zone</a> [JURIST report]. Human Rights Watch released a report entitled "Here, Rape is Normal" in February 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-somali-officials-must-reform-to-prevent-sexual-violence-against-women.php">urging the Somali government to adopt reforms</a> [JURIST report] to help prevent sexual violence against women and provide support for victims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=103">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] on Monday rejected a petition to stop US drone attacks in the northwestern tribal region of the country. Justice Saqib Nisar presided over the petition and <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistani-court-rejects-petition-to-stop-us-drone-strikes-754611">concluded</a> [PTI report] that the it was not a legal issue but rather a security related matter. The decision comes after Pakistan's <a href="http://www.ihc.gov.pk/">Islamabad High Court</a> [official website] last week <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistan-court-orders-case-against-cia-member-for-drone-deaths.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order to register a report against former CIA station chief Jonathan Banks for his involvement in a 2009 US drone attack that killed two tribesmen. Outside of the courts, many Pakistani officials have continually condemned the US drone strikes within the county.   </p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both the international arena and in domestic circles. Last March the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-drone-strikes-should-follow-international-law.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] urging states to comply with international law in the use of armed drone strikes. UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-accountability-transparency-in-use-of-drones.php">called for transparency and accountability</a> [JURIST report] in the use of drones in counter-terrorism operations in his report in October 2013. A joint Human Rights Watch and International Human Rights Clinic <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/arms0514_ForUpload_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] also raised possible threats to human rights, such as the right to life, in law enforcement situations. In the US at the same time, California refused to limit drone use in domestic law enforcement when its governor <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/california-governor-vetoes-drone-use-regulation-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required enforcement agencies to acquire warrants to use drones for surveillance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Turkish court in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Monday acquitted a Dutch journalist accused of producing propaganda materials on behalf of a Kurdish rebel group. Freelance journalist Frederike Geerdink was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/dutch-journalist-acquitted-turkish-terrorism-propaganda-charge-124702041.html">charged</a> [Reuters report] with disseminating "terrorist propaganda" after she made a series of social media posts allegedly in support of the government-banned <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> (PKK) [BBC profile]. Geerdink's arrest and prosecution drew heavy criticism from rights groups and the Dutch government. A panel of three judges acquitted Geerdink inline with a recommendation from the prosecutor that the charges be dropped due to lack of evidence.  </p>

<p>The Turkish government in recent years has been accused of censoring free speech in both print media and social media. Last week a spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/turkish-prosecutor-orders-blocking-of-social-media-sites.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that a state prosecutor had ordered Internet providers to block social networking sites including Twitter and YouTube. In January a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/turkish-court-orders-facebook-to-censor-pages-insulting-prophet-muhammed.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a ban on Facebook pages that contain materials insulting the Prophet Muhammad. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/turkish-government-weakening-rule-of-law-hrw.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey's ruling <a href="https://www.akparti.org.tr/site/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], is taking steps to weaken the rule of law, control Internet and media, and suppress critics and protesters. Last April the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/turkish-authorities-lift-twitter-ban-following-court-ruling.php">lifted a ban</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter following a Constitutional Court ruling, which stated that the ban violated both individual rights as well as the freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN rights expert said Monday that the civilian refugees from Palestine and Syria trapped inside the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-human-rights-official-to-make-emergency-trip-to-is-controlled-syrian-camp.php">Yarmouk refugee camp</a> [JURIST report] have <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50555#.VSvjo_nF8no">suffered "untold indignities"</a> [UN News Centre report]. There are approximately 18,000 people within the Yarmouk refugee camp including 3,500 children. The <a href="http://www.unrwa.org/">UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East</a> (UNRWA) [advocacy website] has been providing humanitarian aid to those trapped inside the camp, but disturbances due to intense fighting between militant groups in some regions have caused thousands to be deprived of aid for months. <a href="http://www.unrwa.org/resources/about-unrwa/biography-unrwa-commissioner-general-pierre-kr%C3%A4henb%C3%BChl">Pierre Krähenbühl</a> [official profile ], Commissioner-General for the UNRWA called for "all sides to respect the beleaguered civilians trapped inside Yarmouk" adding that "the Syria conflict has a human face. These are individuals with a dignity and destiny that must be at the centre of our responses as we grapple with the complexities of protecting civilians, in Yarmouk and beyond."<br />
 <br />
The <a href="=/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Earlier this month IS asserted control over the refugee camp in Yarmouk. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR jointly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda stated in November that the her office was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters, but said last week that her office <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">lacks jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to open a formal investigation into the group. UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported in December that the IS <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] on Monday reported an <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12254&ctl=Details&mid=15756&ItemID=38675&language=en-US">increase in civilian casualties</a> [press release] from ground engagements in Afghanistan compared to the same time last year, with indications that the number will only continue to rise in the coming months. The report appeals to the Afghan National Security Forces and anti-government elements, the main contributors to the Afghan conflict, to "take all necessary measures to protect civilians." Overall recorded casualties for the first three months of this year already number 266, a 43 percent increase from last year. UNAMA also noted a significant increase in women and children casualties, reporting that the toll on both groups surpassed the unprecedented highs of last year. The report identifies anti-government elements as the largest contributor to civilian casualties, followed by improvised explosive devices and targeted killings. The Taliban is identified as a responsible party to a substantial part of target killings, and the UN has called on the group to cease all attacks aimed at non-participants, citing international law restrictions. </p>

<p>Afghanistan has faced much criticism over reported human rights abuses and staggering numbers of casualties. UNAMA's current report shows the alarming increase in the casualty toll, as 2015 has already <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">surpassed</a> [JURIST report] the numbers accumulated for 2014, which was said to be the bloodiest year since 2009. The international community has also appealed for greater human rights protections, especially for women as Afghan law sees them as <a href="/hotline/2009/08/afghanistans-shia-personal-status-law.php">second-class citizens</a> [JURIST op-ed]. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-afghanistan-donors-must-urge-prosecution-of-human-rights-violations.php">economic donors</a> [JURIST report] to Afghanistan to demand prosecution of human rights violations, while <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged for the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">protection</a> [JURIST report] of female activists, and the prosecution of those who use violence to silence their dissent. There does seem to be some improvement of conditions in Afghanistan, as a UNAMA report released earlier this year showed <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-reports-progress-toward-torture-prevention-in-afghanistan.php">"some progress"</a> [JURIST report] towards preventing the torture and ill-treatment of government detainees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli settlement farmers in the occupied West Bank are using Palestinian child laborers in dangerous conditions in violation of international laws, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2015/04/13/ripe-abuse-0">reported</a> [text] Monday. The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/13/israel-settlement-agriculture-harms-palestinian-children-0">report</a> [press release] states that hundreds of Palestinian children, some as young as 11 years old, are working on the farms for low wages to grow, harvest and pack agricultural produce. HRW condemned the Israeli practice of using child laborers, stating that Israel should not be able to profit from rights abuses against Palestinian children. HRW stated that this is a violation of international laws, which protect children from "being exploited economically and performing work that is likely to be hazardous or interfere with the child's schooling." HRW has called upon Israel to dismantle the settlements on occupied Palestinian lands and asks that other countries and businesses uphold their own responsibilities to not benefit from or contribute to the human rights abuses against the Palestinian children. </p>

<p>In recent years child labor laws have become a growing subject of international attention. Last July the <a href="http://www.senado.bo/">Bolivian National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] passed legislation <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/bolivia-lowers-child-labor-age-restriction.php">permitting</a> [JURIST report] children as young as 10 to join the workforce as long as it does not interfere with one's education and is done independently in an effort to provide for their family. In 2013 the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">UN International Labor Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] released a report on child labor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-group-social-protections-key-to-ending-child-labor.php">advocating social protections</a> [JURIST report] as the key to ending the practice. "[The] report contributes to a better understanding of the underlying economic and social vulnerabilities that generate child labour." Globally, the ILO estimates that at least 215 million children are in an adverse labor situation, with 115 million suffering the worst treatment including "practices akin to slavery, debt bondage, offering a child for prostitution, using a child for illicit activities and work that is harmful to health, safety or morals of children." To combat the problem, the ILO advocates the implementation of "social protection floors" in all countries to provide for the most basic needs of children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlement.fr/index.html">French Parliament</a> [official website, in French] on Monday debated a bill that would give French intelligence services more powers to bug and track potential terrorists in France. The bill would require Internet companies to monitor suspicious behavior. Internet companies are concerned that the legislation could deter clients, and civil liberties advocates argue that the bill lacks adequate privacy protections. The government has dismissed these concerns and clarified that the measures being proposed are not aimed at general surveillance, but to monitor target people to protect citizens of France. The government's hope is that such action would prevent an imminent terror attack. The French government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] the bill in March.</p>

<p>Government surveillance policies have been hotly debated recently. Much of the focus comes as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former US <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. One of the first challenges to NSA activities came in June 2013, when the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court just days after Snowden claimed responsibility for the leaks. As the outcry over the revelations began to expand in scope and severity, several other human rights groups decided to sue as well. The following month both the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> [advocacy websites] filed suit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-surveillance.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] similar claims on the behalf of a coalition of 19 separate organizations. Last month a US District Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-warrantless-surveillance.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to NSA warrantless surveillance. Also in February the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of citizens' Internet use violates human rights law. In July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK's <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">Secret Intelligence Service</a> [official website] known as MI6, alleging that the agency accesses data from undersea cables in violation of the rights to private life and freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] So-called "less-lethal" weapons used by law enforcement can have <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/less-lethal-weapons-can-kill-and-police-misuse-them-for-torture/">deadly consequences</a> [press release], <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and the <a href="http://www.omegaresearchfoundation.org">Omega Research Foundation</a> [advocacy websites] said in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/1305/2015/en/">briefing</a> [materials] presented Monday to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/">UN Crime Congress</a> [official website] in Doha, Qatar. Marek Marczynski, Head of Military, Security and Police at AI, stated, "[p]olice force and prison officials have at their disposal a dizzying array of weapons and kit that, while known as 'less-lethal,' can cause serious injury or even death. ... [B]ody-worn electric shock devices, spiked batons, and thumb cuffs have no place in policing." AI acknowledged that when used properly, "less-lethal" weapons can minimize the amount of injuries and deaths during protests. However, these weapons can be particularly harmful to elderly, children, pregnant women or those with compromised health. The briefing covered five categories of equipment, including: restraints, kinetic impact devices, riot control agents, electric shock devises and acoustic devices. Under international standards police may use force only when "strictly necessary" and to the extent required by their duties. AI stated that with the exception of the US and the EU, "less-lethal" weapons are poorly regulated and subject to fewer restrictions than conventional weapons. The groups recommended stricter standards and controls for "less-lethal" weapons, licensing systems to ensure they do not end up in the wrong hands, and clear standards in the development of such equipment to ensure proper use.</p>

<p>Police response to protesters remains a controversial human rights issue across the globe. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/european-rights-court-finds-italy-police-beating-at-2001-g-8-genoa-summit-was-torture.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the beating of a 62-year-old man by an Italian police officer during the Genoa G-8 summit in July of 2001 amounted to torture. In November 2008 an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-court-acquits-majority-of-police.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] the majority of police officers involved in other alleged G8 human rights violations. Last month Human Rights Watch reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/jurist-riot-police-in-kuwait.php">riot police in Kuwait disbanded protests</a> [JURIST report], arresting 16 protesters who may be charged with attacking law enforcement officers and illegal gathering. The demonstrators were seeking democratic reforms including new parliamentary elections, release of some political prisoners, and an end to judicial corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan's <a href="http://ihc.gov.pk/">Islamabad High Court</a> (IHC) [official website] on Monday ordered the Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court to conclude its case over the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2008/mumbai_attacks/default.stm">2008 attacks in Mumbai</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+attack">news archive</a>] within the next two months. The case has been ongoing since 2009 against seven suspects being tried in Pakistan with connection to the attacks, which killed 166 people and damaged relations between India and Pakistan. The IHC warned that if the case did not meet its two-month deadline, it would approve the government's plea for cancellation of the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistan-court-orders-release-of-main-suspect-in-2008-mumbai-attacks.php">bail</a> [JURIST report] granted last week to suspected mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman. It meanwhile adjourned the case regarding the cancellation of Lakhvi's bail until the deadline passes. One of judges also <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-court-sets-two-month-deadline-to-conclude-mumbai-attack-case/66791.html">reportedly</a> [<em>Tribune India</em> report] informed the court that Lakhvi's bail was likely to be cancelled if his lawyers caused any delay in the case. </p>

<p>A Pakistan court ordered Lakhvi's release less than a month after Pakistan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-reorders-detention-of-alleged-mastermind-of-2008-mumbai-attacks.php">reordered his detention</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/pakistan-high-court-overturns-release-of-terrorist-suspect.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Lakhvi's release in January. Lakhvi was granted bail in early December, but the government immediately imposed a three-month detention order to keep him in prison. However, Lakhvi appealed this order and was released in late December. Hours after his release, Lakhvi was in<a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistani-police-detain-mastermind-of-mumbai-attacks-on-abduction-charges.php"> police custody</a> [JURIST report] again for an alleged kidnapping. The latest detention of Lakhvi comes after his January 12 hearing. In 2012, India executed the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/29/timeline-the-trial-of-mohammed-ajmal-kasab/">Mohammad Ajmal Kasab</a> [WSJ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kasab">news archive</a>]. In August 2009 India <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-court-sentences-mumbai-bombers-to.php">sentenced three terrorists to death for their part in similar attacks in 2003</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Monday sentenced a former Blackwater security contractor to life in prison and three others to 30 years for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/world/middleeast/03firefight.html">killing of unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007</a> [NYT report]. Nicholas Slatten, a former Army sniper, was found guilty of murder for firing the first fatal shots. The other three men, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty and Paul Slough, were found guilty of manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and use of a machine gun in a violent crime. The 2007 shooting ultimately ended in the deaths of 17 people. While in court for their sentencing, the men maintained their innocence and claimed that the shootings were justified. Judge Royce Lamberth, although agreeing with the October 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-jury-returns-guilty-verdict-for-blackwater-security-guards.php">guilty verdicts</a> [JURIST report], held back tears when describing the defendants as "good young men who've never been in trouble, who served their country." However, he made it clear that such gruesome, unprovoked shootings would never be tolerated, no matter what the circumstances.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] and its employees have faced legal controversy in recent years for activities during the Iraq war. In October the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-regulation-of-private-security-companies.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] stronger global and regulation of private security companies. The call came on the heels of the guilty verdict against the four ex-Blackwater security guards. In August 2012 Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/blackwater-agrees-to-settle-federal-criminal-charges.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] federal criminal charges dealing with export and firearm violations. Also in 2012 Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/blackwater-settles-last-lawsuit-in-2007-baghdad-shooting-incident.php">reached a confidential settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with survivors and families of victims in the 2007 shooting incident. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts expired and were not renewed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.tncourts.gov/courts/supreme-court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/sites/default/files/docs/death_penalty_order.pdf">postponed</a> [order, PDF] the execution of four inmates on death row as it decides whether current protocols are constitutional, effectively halting all executions in the state. Once the constitutional issues are decided, the court "shall exercise its authority to set new dates of execution." Friday's order makes Tennessee the latest state to halt executions while exploring issues surrounding the drugs used for lethal injections. According to the <a href="http://www.tn.gov/correction/">Department of Corrections of Tennessee</a> [official website], the number of inmates currently on death row within the state is 69; 68 are male, and one is female. The last person sentenced to death row was in December. Tennessee has not executed anyone since 2009 and has only carried out six executions in the past four decades.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST archive] and execution methods have been at the forefront of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Earlier this month the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty, but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed. Also last month <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-state-attorneys-general-ask-supreme-court-to-ban-oklahoma-execution-drug-cocktail.php">more than a dozen</a> [JURIST report] former state attorneys general asked the US Supreme Court to rule Oklahoma's use of the three-drug execution cocktail unconstitutional. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Congressman <a href="http://dougcollins.house.gov">Doug Collins</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://dougcollins.house.gov/uploads/REP%20COLLINS%20RESOLUTION%20OF%20DISAPPROVAL.pdf">introduced a resolution</a> [text, PDF] to block <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/fcc-chairman-proposes-regulating-internet-like-a-public-utility.php">net neutrality rules</a> [JURIST report] that were introduced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February. In a <a href="http://dougcollins.house.gov/press-releases/rep-doug-collins-introduces-measure-to-cancel-fcc-regulations/">press release</a> [press release] Collins noted that this resolution would only require a "Senate majority to pass under special procedural rules of the Congressional Review Act." In Collins' view, the resolution would be "the quickest way to stop heavy-handed agency regulations that would slow internet speeds, increase consumer prices, and hamper infrastructure development ... [as] resources that could go to broadband deployment will go to federal taxes and fees." Collins also questioned the timing of the FCC's net neutrality solution, claiming that it came under political pressure, and that the FCC "will continue to grow its power in secret, despite Congress' authority in this matter." Thus, in presenting this resolution, Collins and his colleagues claim to be promoting a "Free and Open Internet," that "increases access and participation."</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/net-neutrality/">Net neutrality</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has emerged as a major political and legal issue in the US and internationally. In November US President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality">said</a> [statement] that he strongly supports the concept of net neutrality. Last May the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/fcc-approves-new-internet-traffic-rules.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] new Internet traffic rules in light of a recent court <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that struck down former rules requiring broadband providers to employ nondiscriminatory practices in the treatment of Internet content. In April the European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/european-parliament-approves-net-neutrality-proposal.php#.U1qsYP3-VFx">approved</a> [JURIST report] a net neutrality proposal that prohibits Internet service providers from enhancing or restricting services for selected Internet traffic. The proposed law, approved by a 534-25 vote with 58 abstentions, aims to treat all Internet traffic equally by making it illegal to block, slow down or give preferential treatment to certain specific applications and services for economic or other reasons. Last year the FCC announced it <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/fcc-will-not-appeal-federal-appellate-court-net-neutrality-decision.php#.U1qdzv3-VFx">would not appeal</a> [JURIST report] the court ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that struck down net neutrality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Fukui District Court issued an injunction on Tuesday halting the restart of two nuclear reactors is Takahama, Japan. These reactors, operated by <a href="http://www.kepco.co.jp/english/">Kansai Electric Power</a> [official website], met the basic safety guidelines set by Japan's <a href="https://www.nsr.go.jp/english/">Nuclear Regulatory Agency</a> (NRA) [official website, in English] and were scheduled to re-open this year. However, the court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/14/us-japan-nuclear-idUSKBN0N505020150414">ruled</a> [Reuters report] in favor of the locals that requested the injunction, citing the lack of credible evacuation measures and an underestimated earthquake risk. The court <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32297366">stated</a> [BBC report] that the NRA's regulations lack rationality. This decision will further delay government plans to restart reactors, and Japanese courts are set to review other similar injunctions. All nuclear reactors in Japan remain offline since the 2011 <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/fukushima-nuclear-accident-update-log-51">Fukushima nuclear disaster</a> [IAEA backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fukushima">news archive</a>]. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/english/judicial_sys/overview_of/overview/index.html">Japan's court system</a> [official website, in English] has been busy adjudicating issues relating to the 2011 Fukushima disaster. In August 2012 Japanese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-prosecutors-initiate-criminal-investigation-into-fukushima-nuclear-disaster.php">opened</a> a criminal investigation into the power plant meltdown after more than 1,300 people <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/criminal-complaint-filed-against-japan-nuclear-plant-executives.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] a criminal complaint against the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) for causing the catastrophe and the resulting radiation. The complaint came two months after an expert panel <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/expert-panel-claims-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-crisis-was-preventable.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the disaster was preventable, and was not caused solely by the earthquake and tsunami, but that officials did not act quickly enough to prevent the meltdown. In March 2012 a group of TEPCO shareholders <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/japan-power-company-shareholders-suing-over-fukushima-nuclear-crisis.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a USD $67 billion lawsuit against TEPCO also for failing to prevent the disaster. In August 2011 five months after the meltdown, Japan's legislature voted to compensate those adversely affected by the incident by creating a fund for dispensing money to such victims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1508136.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released on Monday stated 2014 was marked by rape, sexual enslavement and forced marriages used by extremists like Boko Haram and the Islamic State. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon</a> [official website] said in the report that <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2015/04/un_report_decries_rape_sexual.html">destroying these radical groups is essential</a> [AP report] in the fight against sexual violence. Nineteen countries including Syria, Nigeria, Iraq and Somalia, are trying to emerge from conflict that has resulted in sexual violence, in which 45 groups are credibly suspected of perpetrating these crimes. Congo's government, in particular, has taken substantial steps to address sexual violence, including prosecuting high-ranking officials for these crimes and compensating victims. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=174">Zainab Hawa Bangur</a> [official profile], Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y8IqiaY7B8&feature=youtu.be">stated</a> [video] that 2014 has proven "the international community must renew its commitment and apply increased pressure so as not to lose the ground we have gained and to meet the demands of new and emerging threats."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] has caused increasing international alarm over its human rights abuses since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR jointly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda stated in November that the ICC was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters, but said last week that her office <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">lacks jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to open a formal investigation into the group. In February IS led suicide bombings in eastern Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/islamic-state-kills-40-in-suicide-bombing.php">killing</a> [JURIST report] at least 40 people and injuring 70 more. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chilean <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/michelle-bachelet/">President Michelle Bachelet</a> [Forbes profile] signed a law on Monday that recognizes civil unions between same-sex couples, a move hailed by advocates as a step toward full marriage rights. The law, which will take effect in six months, gives same-sex and unmarried couples the right to inherit each other's property, join one another's health plans and receive pension benefits. "This ends the monopoly of having to recognize unions, families, as just within marriage," <a href="http://www.movilh.cl/bachelet-union-civil-es-un-paso-para-terminar-con-diferencias-entre-parejas-homosexuales-y-heterosexuales/">said Rolando Jimenez</a> [press release, in Spanish], president of the <a href="http://www.movilh.cl">Gay Liberation and Integration Movement</a> (MOVILH) [advocacy website, in Spanish]. "This is very good news for Chile." Couples will be able to validate their civil unions by registering it in the civil registry. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial globally in recent years, particularly in Latin America. In 2013 Uruguay joined Argentina as the only South American countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-congress-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage.php">to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In May 2012 the City of Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/argentina-district-recognizes-same-sex-marriage-for-foreigners-tourists.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to recognize same-sex marriages for non-citizens. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UK judge ruled Tuesday that a convicted member of the Basque separatist group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">Euskadi Ta Askatasuna</a> (ETA) [JURIST news archive] can be extradited to Spain. In his ruling, Judge Howard Riddle said there had been no abuse of process in Antoio Troitino's case, and he <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/uk-judge-rules-basque-fugitive-extradited-spain-131129567.html">could receive a fair trial in Spain</a> [AP report]. Troitino served 24 years in a Spanish prison for his role in more than 20 killings. He was released in 2011. However, Spanish authorities said he had been released too soon. Troitino was arrested in the UK in 2012 on a Spanish warrant, and he has been fighting extradition ever since. Riddle said Troitino could be extradited on terrorism charges, and gave Troitino seven days to appeal. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/spain-requests-us-aid-in-extradition-of-eta-members-from-cuba.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the US use diplomatic discussions with Cuba regarding the country's removal from the State Sponsors of Terrorism blacklist to seek the extradition of two ETA members residing in Cuba. In January Spain's Interior Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/spain-authorities-arrest-16-for-ties-with-basque-group.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the arrest of 16 individuals for alleged connections with ETA. Twelve of the individuals arrested were lawyers, while the other four were treasurers for a group that represents ETA prisoners. In November 2013 the Spanish National Court ordered the release of 13 members of ETA in compliance with a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-127697#{">ruling</a> [judgment] made the month before. The ECHR decision overturned the "<a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/parot-doctrine/spain-parot-doctrine.pdf">Parot Doctrine</a>" [LOC backgrounder] which had effectively allowed for life imprisonment despite the thirty-year prison limit set by Spain's 1973 Penal Code.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Milan court declared on Tuesday that former Italian prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11981754">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile, JURIST<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Berlusconi"> news archive</a>] has fully served his sentence for tax fraud and will now be permitted to travel out of the country. Berlusconi was found <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php#.U01rQRZCe2w">guilty of tax fraud</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 and was originally sentenced to four years in prison on charges that his media empire <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian] purchased television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declared the costs on its taxes. Berlusconi, now 78, was legally considered too old to serve prison time and would have been subjected to serve his sentence under house arrest. However, he was ordered instead to perform a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/an-italian-court-ruled-tuesday.php">year of community service</a> [JURIST report] at a home for the elderly, and his ability to travel was restricted. Because his sentence has come to an end, Berlusconi's passport will be returned to him. However, he will still be barred from running for public office under Italian anti-corruption laws.</p>

<p>Berlusconi has been at the center of several political scandals in recent years. He was <a href="http://www.dw.de/seven-years-jail-for-berlusconi-appeal-likely/a-16903056">convicted</a> [AP report] in 2013 of paying for sex with an underage exotic dancer and then abusing his power to cover up the crime. However, last year an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/italy-appeals-court-overturns-berlusconi-underage-prostitution-conviction.php">overturned</a> the conviction and seven-year prison sentence, and the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/italy-top-court-upholds-berlusconi-acquittal.php">acquittal was upheld</a> [JURIST reports] in March, after courts determined that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the former prime minister had known that the exotic dancer was only 17 when the incident occurred. Having been a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-prime-minister-silvio-berlusconi.php#.U01sJBZCe2x">defendant</a> [JURIST report] in nearly 50 cases, Berlusconi has avoided prison through successful appeals and expired statute of limitations. He has, however suffered much political fallout as a result of his criminal charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/14/mali-lawlessness-abuses-imperil-population">expressed concern</a> [press release] over the increased violence and human rights abuses committed in Mali. Bandits, Islamist armed groups and pro-government militias have reportedly threatened the security of civilians in the central and northern Mali, with little or no action from the government. The advocacy group recounted interviews they recorded with numerous victims and witnesses of the violence, including mayors, sheep herders, drivers and religious leaders. These accounts detail acts of abduction, threats, abuse, theft and extortion. HRW asked armed groups to stop their violence against civilians and urged the Mali government to address the widespread violence and come to the aid of its citizens. According to the West Africa Director at HRW, "The Malian government needs to re-establish its presence in the north so everyone has the basic security needed to go on with their lives."</p>

<p>Following the armed rising against the Malian government in early 2012, the nation has experienced significant turmoil relating to the exercise of power by the Malian government and opposing forces. In April a UN internal inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-internal-inquiry-finds-use-of-excessive-force-in-mali.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that members of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) used "unauthorized and excessive force" resulting in the deaths of three civilian protesters and the injuries of four other individuals in January. Earlier in April the Taureg-led rebels in Mali <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-mali-talks-idUSKBN0MT29S20150402">met with</a> [Reuters report] Algerian mediators to discuss terms of preliminary peace deals, the same deals they rejected last month. Those rebels are currently in fights with French and U.N. troops in northern Mali, seeking autonomy for the Azawad desert region. In March of last year, UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-expert-urges-mali-to-strengthen-judicial-system.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Mali to strengthen its judicial system due to the difficulty faced in attempting to prosecute war crimes in the nation, and called on MINUSMA to assist. In November 2014 General Amadou Haya Sanogo, the leader of the March 2012 coup, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-mali-junta-detained-for-murder.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of murder, complicity to murder, assassination and kidnapping. In March 2013 Malian Tuareg rebels <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mali-rebels-call-for-icc-investigation.php">called on the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged war crimes committed by Malian government forces during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/15272/index.do">ruled</a> [judgment] Tuesday that the national law requiring minimum sentences for gun crimes is unconstitutional because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The high court ruled 6-3 to <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/04/14/supreme-court-canada-national-gun-laws-mandatory-minimum-sentences-crimes.html">affirm</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] a 2013 ruling on the issue. Section 95 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-47.html#docCont">Canadian criminal code</a> [government website] outlines the criminal punishment for conviction of possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with ammunition. Section 95(2) requires a minimum punishment of three years for a first offense and five years for a second or subsequent offense. The provisions in &#167; 95 were enacted in 2008, as part of a broad omnibus bill introduced by federal conservatives. The court reasoned that in most cases a punishment under &#167; 95(2) will not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but under some reasonably foreseeable circumstances the punishment is unduly strict and there is no real threat to public welfare, such as licensing infractions. Canadian Justice Minister Peter MacKay said the <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/harper-s-tough-on-crime-agenda-dealt-a-legal-blow-by-scc-1.2325934">government will review the decision</a> [CP report] to consider potential "next steps towards protecting Canadians from gun crime and ensuring that our laws remain responsive." </p>

<p>Firearm possession and gun owner's rights has been at the forefront of the Canadian judiciary in recent months, after the debate over minimum criminal sentences worked its way up the courts in the past few years. In March the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the federal government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/canada-top-court-quebec-has-no-legal-right-to-federal-governments-long-gun-registry.php">does not have to relinquish its gun-registry database</a> [JURIST report] to Quebec. The Court's 5-4 decision <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/quebec-has-no-legal-right-to-federal-governments-long-gun-registry-data-supreme-court-rules">affirmed</a> [<em>National Post</em> report] Parliament's constitutional right over criminal law. In January 2013, a judge for the Provincial Court of British Columbia  <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/british-columbia-judge-strikes-down-minimum-sentence-for-firearm-possession.php">held</a> [JURIST report] the federal government's mandatory minimum sentence law for the possession of a loaded and prohibited firearm is arbitrary and fundamentally unjust. In that case, a 29-year-old male with no prior criminal record who was arrested by police and found with a loaded Glock 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun outside a restaurant and he was sentenced to three years. The man's lawyer successfully argued the punishment was unjust. A year prior, the Ontario Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/canada-judge-refuses-to-impose-mandatory-minimum-sentence-in-handgun-case.php">refused to impose a mandatory minimum sentence</a> [JURIST report] established by the Canadian federal government for firearm possession, declaring the guideline unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Boko Haram has abducted at least 2,000 women and girls in Nigeria since the start of 2014, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said Monday in a new <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/our-job-is-to-shoot-slaughter-and-kill-boko-haram-s-reign-of-terror">report</a> [press release] detailing the extreme violence and crimes against humanity committed by the group. The <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/nigeriabhreport2015.compressed.pdf">90-page report</a> [text, PDF] is entitled: "'Our job is to Shoot, Slaughter and Kill': Boko Haram's Reign of Terror." The document relies on testimonials form more than 377 individuals and nearly 200 witness accounts. The report goes into detail about the tactics used by Boko Haram to impose terror; including abductions, mass killings and general destruction of towns and schools. Perhaps most disturbing is the abduction, forced-imprisonment and forced-marriage of schoolgirls and women. AI noted that actual data is hard to find, but the approximate number of abducted women and girls is likely to exceed 2,000:<blockquote>It is difficult to estimate how many people have been abducted by Boko Haram. The number of women and girls is likely to be higher than 2,000. According to a human rights defender who has verified and documented many cases of abductions, between November 2014 and February 2015 alone, more than 500 women and 1,000 children were abducted from Gwoza LGA. The majority of people abducted by Boko Haram were unmarried women and girls, many of whom were forced into marriage with Boko Haram fighters. Men and boys abducted by Boko Haram were forced to provide services for Boko Haram or to join them as fighters. Boko Haram also imprisoned thousands of civilians in its camps and in towns under its control, generally holding them in large houses, prisons or other buildings, under armed guard. In Bama town hundreds of men were held by Boko Haram in the town's prison for several weeks before being executed.</blockquote><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boko+haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501">BBC profile</a>], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. Two weeks ago, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, reported that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">murdering women and girls</a> [JURIST report] previously taken captive by the group. At the end of March, Nigeria held its presidential and gubernatorial elections in spite of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/nigeria-holds-presidential-elections-amid-violence.php">violent attacks directed towards voters</a> [JURIST report] by Boko Haram. The elections, originally scheduled for February 14, were <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/nigeria-elections-postponed-following-boko-haram-v/?page=all">postponed</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] as Nigeria attempted to eradicate Boko Haram after reports that the group had acquired military-grade weaponry, including armored personnel carriers. In February the UN reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">girls have been attacked</a> [JURIST report] and been subjected to gender oppression in at least 70 countries for seeking an education. In January the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-security-council-condemns-boko-haram-attacks.php">UN Security Council condemned attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to terrorist attacks and the release of abducted child soldiers. The hostilities included mass killings, destruction of civilian homes and suicide bombings where children where induced to carry out the attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4780_en.htm">initiated</a> [press release] antitrust proceedings against <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> [corporate website] accusing the company of utilizing their dominant position in the search engine market to hurt competitors. The commission sent Google a Statement of Objections, which describe how the search engine company has negatively affected the <a href="http://www.efta.int/eea">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) [official website] by favoring its own shopping products within search results. The commission also issued a statement in regards to the allegations, which reads, "[t]he Commission is concerned that users do not necessarily see the most relevant results in response to queries&#8212;to the detriment of consumers and rival comparison shopping services." The Commission has also opened an antitrust case against Google addressing issues with its Android operating system. </p>

<p>Google has faced legal action both in the US and internationally.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.guamag.org/">Attorney General of Guam</a> [official website] on Wednesday directed officials to begin processing same-sex marriage applications. The action by Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson comes two weeks after a same-sex couple brought a suit in the US territory <a href="http://www.guamag.org/press%20releases/2015/2-Apr-Jun/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20License%2004.09.2015.pdf">challenging its marriage law</a> [press release, PDF] upon being denied a license. The <a href="http://dphss.guam.gov/">Department of Public Health and Social Services of Guam</a> (DPHSS) [official website] has refused the attorney general's request to process same-sex marriage applications until a legal opinion is released addressing the issue. Barrett-Anderson <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/guam-to-process-gay-marriage-license-applications/2015/04/14/d15c33b8-e321-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_story.html">stated</a> [AP report] that the DPHSS should treat "all same gender marriage applicants with dignity and equality under the Constitution." If Guam moves forward in processing the applications it will become the first US territory to allow same-sex marriage. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is currently legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia but continues to be a controversial issue. In March Puerto Rican officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/puerto-rico-officials-to-stop-opposing-same-sex-marriage.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Puerto Rico is ending its defense of a same-sex marriage ban. The US Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on the issue later this month. The court agreed in January to take the case, <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in four cases. The court consolidated appeals from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee after the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/sixth-circuit-upholds-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">upheld bans</a> [JURIST report] in those states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Senate voted 27-11 to repeal the law, which has been on the books in Florida since 1977. The bill, which already <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2015/7013/Vote/HouseVote_h7013e1013.PDF">passed</a> [vote, PDF] the <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/">Florida House of Representatives</a> in March, now heads to <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website]. The Florida law banning same-sex adoption was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/florida-appeals-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] by a Florida appeals court in 2010.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and adoption remain divisive and controversial issues around the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15836&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] combatants in the current conflict in Yemen to report attacks resulting in civilian casualties so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. The High Commissioner expressed deep concern for Yemeni civilians, stating:<blockquote>such a heavy civilian death toll ought to be a clear indication to all parties to this conflict that there may be serious problems in the conduct of hostilities. The parties to the conflict are obliged to ensure that international humanitarian law and international human rights law are scrupulously respected and that the civilian population is protected. Any suspected breach of international law must be urgently investigated with a view to ensuring victims' right to justice and redress and to ensure that such incidents do not recur.</blockquote>According to the UN at least 364 civilians have been killed since March 26, with another 681 injured. Zeid also noted that air strikes and shelling during the conflict have destroyed significant amounts of public infrastructure including, hospitals, schools, airports and mosques. The commissioner also reported growing concern over reports of Houthi-affiliated forces firing on protesters and conducting arbitrary arrests in areas under their control. Zeid closed his remarks by calling for all sides to negotiate a swift peace.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">situation in Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">news archive</a>] has sparked significant international concern. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Earlier this month, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/15288/index.do">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] unanimously Wednesday that elected officials do not have the right to open municipal council meetings with a prayer. The country's top court <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/supreme-court-rules-saguenay-mayor-cant-say-prayer-ahead-of-council-meetings?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NP_Top_Stories+%28National+Post+-+Top+Stories%29">found</a> [<em>National Post</em> report] that reciting a Catholic prayer at council meetings is unconstitutional and infringes on freedom of conscience and religion. Council meetings usually start with a short two-line prayer that begins "Almighty God." After a moment of silence, "O Canada" is sung, and the meeting begins. The Supreme Court said the government must remain neutral on matters of religion and may neither favor nor hinder any particular belief. The case dates back to 2007 when Alain Simoneau, an atheist and resident of Saguenay, Quebec, complained about councillors praying in public at city hall. The Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the case last year.</p>

<p>Public prayer also continues to be a hotly debated issue in the US. Last April the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-rules-prayer-allowed-at-town-meetings.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-greece-v-galloway/">Town of Greece v. Galloway</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the practice of opening town meetings with a prayer does not violate the <a href="/feature/featured/the-establishment-clause/">Establishment Clause</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of the First Amendment. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/second-circuit-rules-against-town-council-led-prayer.php#.U2et0Cgxp48">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 that the New York town's practice amounted to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. Last April <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] vetoed a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/virginia-governor-vetoes-school-prayer-bill.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have codified the rights of students to pray voluntarily in school and at school events. Also, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/federal-court-upholds-nyc-ban-on-religious-services-in-schools.php#.U0BCMl7TavM">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a regulation by the New York City Board of Education last April banning religious groups from holding worship services in school buildings. Earlier that same week Mississippi lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/mississippi-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2014/pdf/SB/2600-2699/SB2681PS.pdf">Mississippi Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [SB 2681, PDF], which prevented the state from taking any action that "burdens" a citizen's right to religious exercise. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Cairo criminal court on Wednesday jailed the former chief of staff of deposed Egyptian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] following his conviction for abuse of power. Refaa al-Tahtawi was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/egypt-jails-top-morsi-aide-abuse-power-150851767.html">sentenced</a> [AFP report] to a three-year jail term and ordered to pay a USD $9,000 fine after being convicted of appointing a lawyer who had been banned from public service in the presidency's Office of the Ombudsman. The lawyer had been <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/183542/egypt-court-jails-morsi-era-chief-of-staff-for-39-forgery-39.html">sentenced</a> [AA report] to 15 years in prison for distributing leaflets, according to a judicial source, and the court also sentenced him to a one-year jail term and a USD $9,000 fine as well for accepting the appointment. Al-Tahtawi is also awaiting trial where he, Morsi and more than 30 of Morsi's supporters are facing espionage charges.</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of former president Morsi in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Late last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] 68 people, including members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death, along with 14 others to life in prison. The individuals were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges, after clashes near the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, which occurred just days before Morsi's ouster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported Wednesday that asylum-seekers and migrants fleeing war-torn countries are <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/15/serbia-police-abusing-migrants-asylum-seekers">suffering abuse at the hands of Serbian authorities</a> [press release]. Most of the asylum-seekers are Syrian or Afghan, travelling through Serbia to seek shelter in western European states. Based on interviews with 81 asylum-seekers, HRW stated that there is widespread extortion and abuse, including physical violence, by Serbian police. The Serbian police have <a href="http://wtop.com/europe/2015/04/rights-group-accuses-serbia-of-harassing-migrants/">denied the allegations</a> [AP report], stating that they have received no complaints from asylum-seekers of ill treatment. </p>

<p>The number of asylum-seekers in recent years has grown substantially with the increase in conflicts around the world. In March the UN refugee agency released a report identifying a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-asylum-applications-in-industrialized-countries-have-greatly-increased-due-to-the-syrian-and-iraq.php">significant increase in asylum applications to industrialized countries</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the displacement effectuated primarily by the wars in Syria and Iraq. In February Amnesty International reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-bulgaria-authorities-failing-to-prosecute-hate-crimes.php">Bulgarian authorities fail to address hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] against asylum-seekers. In January the High Court of Australia ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/australia-high-court-rules-high-seas-detention-of-asylum-seekers-lawful.php">off-shore detention of more than 150 ethnic Tamil refugees</a> [JURIST report] aboard an Australian Customs and Border Protection Servicevessel was lawful under the Maritime Powers Act of 2013. Earlier that month, HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-france-police-abusing-asylum-seekers-in-calais.php">French police were abusing and harassing asylum seekers</a> [JURIST report] in the port city of Calais.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://media.jrn.com/documents/johnsondecision.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit that challenged the fairness of the <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF] for allowing members of Congress and their staffs to receive subsidies for their health insurance. <a href="http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/">US Senator Ron Johnson</a> [official website] and one of his aides filed the suit and argued that the rule created an administrative burden on the senator and his staff, resulted in unequal protection, and caused him "reputational and electoral injury." The court affirmed the ruling of the <a href="http://www.wied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] and dismissed the case for lack of standing, agreeing that the plaintiffs received a benefit, not an injury, from the ACA. Senator Johnson <a href="http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=8317cdaa-104a-4a72-8c94-af1f0fc36810">announced</a> [press release] his intention to consider his options in moving forward with the case.</p>

<p>Obama's <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform</a> [JURIST feature] has caused continued debate and legal action since it was passed in 2010. Last month the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-turns-away-latest-health-care-challenge.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear a challenge to the ACA's Independent Payment Advisory Board provision. Earlier in March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral arguments for <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> in which the court was asked to rule on whether the <a href="http://www.irs.gov">Internal Revenue Service</a> [official website] may adopt regulations to extend tax-credit subsidies to coverage purchased through the federal health insurance exchange established under the ACA. Last June the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that closely held corporations can deny contraceptive coverage to their employees for religious reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?jezik=e">Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?id=2894&jezik=e">indicted</a> [press release] 10 former Bosnian-Serb soldiers for war crimes committed during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. The men are accused of imprisoning, torturing and killing 20 people abducted from a train in eastern Bosnia in February of 1993. Cooperation between the Prosecutor's Offices in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia have made it possible to prosecute war crimes committed over 20 years ago. In March the Serbian war crimes prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/5-indicted-for-1993-balkan-war-massacre.php">charged five people</a> [JURIST report] for crimes arising out of the same event. The Bosnian prosecutors included 100 pieces of evidentiary material with the indictment, which will be forwarded to the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for confirmation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. Earlier this month Bosnian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/bosnia-prosecutors-indict-3-people-for-war-crimes-against-serbs.php">indicted three men</a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed against more than 300 Serb civilians between April 1992 and July 1993. In February the International Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icj-rules-serbia-and-croatia-did-not-commit-genocide.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Serbia and Croatia did not commit genocide against one another's citizens during the 1990s war. In January the war crimes division of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-politician-for-genocide.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] the indictment of Dragomir Vasic on charges of genocide. The charges stemmed from the executions of Srebrenica Muslims during the Bosnian Civil War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hadzic is accused of coordinating, supporting and instigating efforts to achieve the "permanent removal of a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from a large part of the territory of the Republic of Croatia" during his term as president. Diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, Hadzic has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/court-indicted-croat-serb-leader-must-be-briefly-released/2015/04/13/aef66700-e1f8-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_story.html">unfit to stand trial</a> [WP report] since October. The ICTY has ordered Hadzic to be released to Serbian custody until his next hearing in May.</p>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icty-opens-final-war-crimes-trial.php">ICTY commenced Hadzic's trial</a> [JURIST report] in October of 2012. In August 2011, Hadzic <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hadzic-pleads-not-guilty-at-icty.php">entered a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY. Hadzic had <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-refuses-to-plead-at-icty.php">refused to enter a plea</a> [JURIST report] the previous month when he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-extradited-to-hague-to-face-icty.php">extradited to The Hague</a> [JURIST report]. Hadzic was the last fugitive of the original 161 sought by the ICTY to be <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report]. The ICTY's work in prosecuting suspected war criminals for acts committed during the Balkan War was part of the impetus for the creation of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] and other conflict and region specific criminal tribunals. The ICTY was the <a href="http://www.icty.org/sections/AbouttheICTY">first war crimes court created by the UN</a> [ICTY backgrounder] and the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. It was created by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] pursuant to Chapter VII of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday urged the EU to put into place a search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean following reports of 400 lives lost at sea. HRW acting deputy Europe and Central Asia director Judith Sutherland <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/15/eu-intolerable-inaction-costs-lives-sea">stated</a> [HRW report] that if reports from a recent confirmed shipwreck, from which 11 bodies were recovered, are confirmed, the past weekend would be "among the deadliest few days in the world's most dangerous stretch of water for migrants and asylum seekers." She went on to say that the number of lives lost would continue to grow if the EU did not intervene by implementing search and rescue operations throughout the area. An estimated 400 people died last weekend while trying to reach Europe, according to <a href="http://www.savethechildren.it/">Save the Children Italy</a> [advocacy website, in Italian], which based its estimate on statements made by thousands of migrants and asylum seekers rescued by the Italian Coast Guard in the last five days. HRW stated that the issue is further complicated by anti-immigration politics in Italy and the EU, with the leader of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League earlier this month demanding that authorities resist requests to aid those seeking asylum, saying that is party would work to prevent arrivals by occupying buildings. </p>

<p>HRW is not the first organization to express concern over this continuing issue. In February <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International </a>(AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/europe-should-do-more-to-manage-migration-crisis-in-mediterranean.php">acknowledged positive signs</a> [JURIST report] from the European Commission's announcement on the migration crisis in the Mediterranean but encouraged the commission to develop concrete solutions that protect and save lives. Earlier that month AI criticized the EU's <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">failure to prevent migration casualties at sea</a> [JURIST report]. The statement came amid reports that as many as 300 migrants may have died off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa that month while attempting to flee adverse conditions in their home countries. According to the rights group, the EU Triton operation, which serves as the replacement for the terminated Italian search and rescue operation, is inadequate to address the pressing issue of increasing numbers of migrants willing to cross treacherous waters to gain entry into the safe borders of the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Missouri executed its third inmate of 2015 Tuesday after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041415zr3_f29g.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF] his final appeal, which claimed that mental illness made him unfit for execution. Missouri <a href="https://governor.mo.gov">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] also <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/gov-nixon-denies-clemency-petition-andre-cole">denied</a> [statement] Andrew Cole's clemency petition, which had raised concerns that the black inmate was convicted by an all white jury. Mike O'Connell, spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections, stated that Cole was given lethal injection at 10:15 PM after declining to give a final statement and was pronounced dead minutes later. Cole was convicted of his friend Anthony Curtis in a fit of rage, after finding out that part of his paycheck would be withheld for child support. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and US Supreme Court denied appeals based on Cole's mental health. The US Supreme Court has also denied appeals based on jury instructions and the method in which Missouri obtains its execution drugs. </p>

<p>The death penalty has been a hotly debated topic as of late. Last week the <a href="https://www.tncourts.gov/courts/supreme-court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/tennessee-top-court-postpones-executions-to-determine-constitutional-issues.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of four inmates on death row as it decides whether current protocols are constitutional, effectively halting all executions in the state. Earlier in April the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty, but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row.  In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed a bill to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">restore the firing squad</a> [JURIST report] as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed. Also last month <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-state-attorneys-general-ask-supreme-court-to-ban-oklahoma-execution-drug-cocktail.php">more than a dozen</a> [JURIST report] former state attorneys general asked the US Supreme Court to rule Oklahoma's use of the three-drug execution cocktail unconstitutional. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Reforms in Bahrain have <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/bahrain-hopes-of-reform-crushed-amid-chilling-crackdown-on-dissent/">failed to end serious human rights violations</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported Wednesday. The <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/MDE1113962015ENGLISH.PDF">79-page report</a> [text, PDF] claims that activists are still being jailed and detainees have been mistreated and tortured. The government implemented the reforms four years ago after anti-government protests began to shake the nation. Although the political system was overhauled and reforms were put in place, AI says more can be done to help remedy the situation. AI urged Bahrain to take the necessary steps, including an overhaul of the judiciary and the release of those jailed for "lawfully exercising their right to freedom of expression." The group is also seeking help from Bahrain's allies, including the UK, the US and other European countries, to become more involved in limiting rights abuses and lobbying for a complete reform of the justice system in Bahrain.</p>

<p>Political tensions between the police and protestors in Bahrain have been high since protests began in early 2011. In February a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-court-convicts-11-of-deadly-police-attack.php">Bahraini court found</a> [JURIST report] 11 Shiites guilty of an attack carried out against police in 2013, and three Shiites were sentenced to death. The other eight defendants were sentenced to life in prison, and their citizenship was stripped. Also in February Bahrain's <a href="http://www.interior.gov.bh/default_en.aspx">Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] initiated a criminal investigation <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">into alleged criminal content</a> [JURIST report] posted by the country's main opposition group, the Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society. In early February a group of UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-experts-urge-bahrain-to-release-political-opposition-leader.php">human rights experts</a> [JURIST report] urged the Bahrain government to release peaceful politician Sheikh Ali Salman. The religious figure serves as the main political opposition to the Al-Wefaq. He was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bahrain-prosecutors-charge-prominent-shiite-leader.php">charged in January</a> [JURIST report] for inciting a change of regime by non-peaceful means.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Alabama and 12 other states filed an <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/news/624.pdf">amicus brief</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/News-624">press release</a>] with the US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday in support of the three-drug combination being used in Oklahoma for executions. Lethal injection executions in many states have been put on hold until the Supreme Court considers <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], a case determining whether Oklahoma's three-drug method of lethal injection violates the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_viii">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The brief calls on the Supreme Court "to close the litigation floodgates" and affirm the constitutionality of the three-drug protocol. Other states to join Alabama in the brief are Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada,Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. </p>

<p>The <a href="/forum/2014/05/brandon-garrett-hangmans-cloak.php">controversy</a> [JURIST op-ed] surrounding the contents of lethal injection drugs and execution protocol in the US has been a mainstream issue in politics and in courts around the US. Last month more than a dozen former state attorneys general <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-state-attorneys-general-ask-supreme-court-to-ban-oklahoma-execution-drug-cocktail.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court to find Oklahoma's use of the three-drug execution cocktail unconstitutional. In January Ohio's <a href="http://www.drc.ohio.gov/">Department of Rehabilitation and Correction</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/ohio-to-change-lethal-injection-drug-protocol.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it is revising its execution protocol to no longer use the two-drug combination that caused the troubling 26-minute execution of Dennis McGuire last year. Last April Oklahoma's execution by lethal injection of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett went <a href="/forum/2014/06/andrew-spiropoulous-oklahoma-death.php">awry</a> [JURIST report]. According to witnesses, 13 minutes after being injected with the drug cocktail, the inmate appeared to regain consciousness and experience pain. Lockett died of a heart attack 27 minutes after state officials called off the execution. Use of the three-drug cocktail has also led to problematic executions in Ohio and Arizona.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Paksitan</a> [official website] suspended all death sentences on Thursday rendered by the country's new military tribunal after the <a href="http://www.scbap.com/scbn/index.php">Supreme Court Bar Association</a> [official website] challenged the constitutional amendment that created the tribunals. This move directly affects six prisoners who <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-6-to-death-for-terrorism.php">faced imminent executions</a> [JURIST report]. The 17-judge panel held that the military tribunals will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32332313">not be permitted</a> [BBC report] to hear terrorism cases until the Supreme Court makes its final ruling because verdicts in these cases often carry death penalties. This decision arises from concerns of fairness and the extent of military power, following international concern by advocacy groups and foreign governments regarding Pakistan's escalating executions. Those convicted by the military tribunals may continue pursuing appeals.</p>

<p>Pakistan's nine military courts were established in January after Taliban militants attacked children in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30505448">Peshawar school massacre</a> [BBC archive; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-savage-extremism-of-taliban-insurgents.php">report</a>], killing 134 students and 19 adults. Military power was subsequently expanded, giving military courts jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism despite the country's civilian government. Critics argue that the new procedures defer too much power to the military. Allegations of torture and judicial abuse were widespread during the reign of previous Pakistani military courts. However, many Pakistanis support the military courts due to the crumbling civilian system. Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] last December, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, last month the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row are <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">minors</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [ official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/ortega_melendres_v_arpaio_9th_circuit_court_of_appeals_-_opinion_4_15_15.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion PDF] that the <a href="http://www.mcso.org">Maricopa County Sherrif's Office</a> [official website] and, specifically, Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, engaged in practices of racial profiling in conducting traffic stops. The court found that the Sheriff's office was improperly named as a defendant, and that the Sheriff, in his official capacity, is representative of the entire entity. The court also ordered that Maricopa County be substituted as a party in lieu of the Sheriff's Office. In affirming part of the District Court's findings, it was ruled that the "provisions of the injunction pertaining to corrective training and supervision procedures and provisions requiring specific data collection and video recording of traffic stops" was not overbroad, and thus was upheld. The court, however, vacated a portion of the lower court's ruling, finding that the provision of the injunction requiring an appointed monitor to consider reports of officer misconduct and internal investigations "created a problem to the extent that such internal investigations and reports were unrelated to the constitutional violations found by the district court." In doing so, the court ordered the district court to "tailor them so as to address only the constitutional violations at issue in this case."</p>

<p>The use of racial profiling by law enforcement officials has been an ongoing topic of discussion in the US. Last year the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">UN Committee Against Torture</a> [official website] <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf">urged the US</a> [report, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-committee-urges-us-to-investigate-police-brutality-and-limit-use-of-tasers---dnp.php">open investigations</a> [JURIST report] into all cases of police brutality and excessive use of force by police officers. The committee expressed concern over the use of force against certain people and the use of "racial profiling by police and immigration offices," among other tactics used by law enforcement. In 2013 the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/blog/government-spying-you-aclu-releases-new-evidence-overly-broad-surveillance-everyday-activities">accused</a> [press release] governmental surveillance centers of invasion of privacy and reliance on racial and religious profiling in their Suspicious Activity Reports <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/asset_upload_file444_12586.pdf">urging</a> [letter, PDF] the centers to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-surveillance-centers-to-narrow-suspicious-activity-standards.php">adopt stricter standards of reporting</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Colombian government on Tuesday modified proposed legislation that would have allowed an expansion of the military courts' jurisdiction and power. <a href="http://www.santospresidente.com/">President Juan Manuel Santos</a> [official website, in Spanish] introduced Senate Bill 85 of 2013 to strengthen the military justice system after Colombia's "false positive" scandal, where army officers tried to present civilians as guerrillas killed in combat to inflate body counts and earn bonuses. Critics of the bill argued that its language was unclear and would allow killings to be tried in the military courts, which have a history of ruling leniently on rights abuses. The bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/colombia-modifies-bill-to-judge-killings-in-military-courts/2015/04/14/76cd8c62-e2fe-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_story.html">emerged from committee</a> [AP report] Tuesday with the ambiguous language removed, ensuring all human rights abuses will remain in the jurisdiction of civilian court. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] praised the decision, as it was one of the most outspoken advocacy groups <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/08/colombia-withdraw-military-jurisdiction-expansion-bill">criticizing the unmodified bill</a> [press release].</p>

<p>In October the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-report-columbia-should-reconsider-expanding-jurisdiction-of-military-courts.php">urged Colombia</a> [JURIST report] to reconsider adopting Senate Bill 85 of 2013 in its original form, because it would have extended military courts jurisdiction to cover homicide, breaches of international humanitarian law and crimes against public security. In 2013 the <a href="http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/">Constitutional Court of Colombia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/colombia-top-court-rules-expanded-military-justice-system-unconstitutional.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] similar legislation expanding the military justice system was unconstitutional based on "procedural defects" within the law. The measure would have placed violations of international human rights law involving the armed forces&#8212;categorizing them as acts related to military service&#8212;under the jurisdiction of an expanded military justice system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French court on Thursday permitted four lesbian women to adopt their wives' children born in foreign countries through artificial insemination. France has legalized same-sex marriage and adoption, but only heterosexual couples are authorized to have medically assisted fertilization. In April 2014 a lower Versailles court ruled that a birth mother had committed fraud by having artificial insemination in Belgium, and the birth mother's wife was not allowed to adopt the child. Versailles' appeals court overturned this ruling before the case headed to <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/">France's highest court</a> [official website, in French], which ruled that medically assisted fertilization performed abroad <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/french-court-oks-adoption-lesbian-partners-30359103">is "not an obstacle" for women</a> [AP report] wishing to adopt the children of their partners. Same-sex couples were granted the right to marry in May 2013. </p>

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be hotly debated issue, both in the US and abroad. France's highest court ruled in January that a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/france-top-court-rules-same-sex-french-moroccan-couple-may-marry.php">same-sex French-Moroccan couple may legally marry</a> [JURIST report]. Also in January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to rule on same-sex marriage, granting <em>certiorari</em> in four separate cases. In August Ugandan Attorney General Peter Nyomb <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal against the constitutional court ruling that struck down the nation's anti-homosexuality law. Last January the Nigerian president <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, banning same-sex marriage and criminalizing same-sex relationships. Similar laws exist in <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">Singapore</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-condemns-lgbt-discrimination-in-jamaica.php">Jamaica</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] approved a resolution on Wednesday <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150413IPR41671/html/Armenian-genocide-centenary-MEPs-urge-Turkey-and-Armenia-to-normalize-relations">calling</a> [press release] the massacre of Armenians during World War I a "genocide," while urging Armenia and Turkey to reconcile their diplomatic relations. The resolution comes days after Pope Francis <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32272604">instigated outrage</a> [BBC report] by using the same term in Turkey. Members of the European Parliament commended the statement of the Pope, "honoring the century of the Armenian genocide in a spirit of peace and reconciliation." The Parliament has asked Turkey to "conduct in good faith an inventory of the Armenian cultural heritage destroyed or ruined during the past century within its jurisdiction." The Parliament also proposed an "International Remembrance Day for Genocides," so as to remind all people, and all nations, of the right to peace and dignity.</p>

<p>In recent years Armenian nationals have fought with the international community to recognize the killing of 1.5 million Armenian citizens as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=armenian+genocide">genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. Turkey has long disputed the numbers, alleging the killings were a result of a civil war that took place after the collapse of the Ottoman empire. In December 2009 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/europe-rights-court-criminal-conviction-for-armenian-genocide-denial-unjustified.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that prosecutions for denying that the killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 was a genocide are an attack on freedom of expression. In 2009 Turkey and Armenia <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/turkey-and-armenia-sign-accord.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a landmark accord in Switzerland to normalize relations between the two countries and open up borders. In 2010 a spokesperson for the US State Department stated that the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">opposed a vote</a> [JURIST report] before the House of Representatives on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [HR 252 materials] branding the World War I-era killings of Armenians by Turkish forces as genocide. In September 2014 the Parliament of Greece ratified a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/greece-parliament-ratifies-bill-criminalizing-armenian-genocide-denial.php">criminalizes the denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Georgia <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/biography-2">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official profile] signed <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20152016/HB/1">House Bill 1</a> [text] on Thursday to legalize medical marijuana in the US state of Georgia. The approved legislation is effective immediately and allows for patients suffering from cancer, Crohn's disease, glaucoma and other serious ailments to receive 20 fluid ounces or less of low-THC cannabis oil. Additionally, HB 1 calls for the immediate repeal of conflicting laws. The bill is known as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/16/us/georgia-medical-marijuana-bill-signing-haleigh-cox/">Haleigh's Hope Act</a> [CNN report], named for a 5-year old Georgian girl that suffered from hundreds of seizures per day before she began using cannabis oil to treat her condition. Deal stated the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/medical-marijuana-bill-georgia-facts/nkwWM/">administrative framework for doctors and patients</a> [<em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> report] should be in place within the next two months, but it remains illegal to cultivate cannabis oil in one's home.     </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale of marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for both medical and recreational purposes has become a controversial issue in the US with a number of states contemplating various legalization initiatives. Earlier this month the Arizona Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/arizona-top-court-rules-medical-marijuana-cannot-be-prohibited-for-parolees.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in two separate decisions that courts cannot prohibit parolees from using medical marijuana when used for medical purposes under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA). Last month Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman filed a brief <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/colorado-asks-supreme-court-to-throw-out-marijuana-case.php">urging the US Supreme Court to throw out a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by Nebraska and Oklahoma challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization law. Last November voters in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/residents-in-alaska-oregon-dc-vote-to-legalize-marijuana.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to legalize recreational marijuana. In September the Pennsylvania State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST Report] legislation that would legalize several forms of medical marijuana. In July Illinois Governor Pat Quinn <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/illinois-governor-signs-bill-expanding-medical-marijuana-for-seizures.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that will allow adults and children suffering from seizures access to medical marijuana. Last April the Maryland House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/maryland-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A bill was introduced in the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Wednesday proposing to tie any further removal of sanctions against Cuba to the nation's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/cuba">human rights record</a> [HRW report]. The measure, titled <a href="http://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cuba_human_rights_bill.pdf">The Cuban Human Rights Act of 2015</a> [text, PDF] and introduced by <a href="http://chrissmith.house.gov/">Representative Chris Smith</a> [official website] of New Jersey, comes in the wake of President Barack Obama's recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/world/americas/obama-cuba-remove-from-state-terror-list.html?_r=0">pronouncement</a> [NY Times report] to Congress that he intends to remove Cuba from the <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm">State Sponsors of Terrorism list</a> [text]. The list is composed of nations the Secretary of State deems guilty of funding international terrorism, and the new measure seeks to prevent Cuba's removal due to an alleged history of sheltering terrorists from Spain, Colombia and the US. Proponents of the bill, such as Smith and <a href="http://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/">Ileana Ros-Lehtinen</a> [official website], argue that it is a bipartisan bill seeking to inform the American people of regular human rights violations in Cuba, and it also serves to rebuke Obama for unilaterally seeking to alter American relations with Cuba. Cuba has been a member of the State Sponsors of Terrorism list since 1982, and is joined on the list by Iran and Sudan.</p>

<p>The US and Cuba recently began working to restore ties for the first time since the nations <a href="http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113">severed relations</a> [CFR backgrounder] in 1961. Earlier this month Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro at the <a href="http://www.summit-americas.org/default_en.htm">Summit of the Americas</a> [official website] in Panama, making a commitment to repairing relations. In January eight Senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-end-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would end US travel restrictions on Cuba. The legislation, which was introduced by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, would also end financial transaction restrictions on travel between the two countries. In December Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/obama-announces-cuba-policy-changes.php">directed</a> [JURIST report] Secretary of State John Kerry to reestablish diplomatic relations and to review Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. He also announced "steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba." In 2011 Obama ordered the Departments of State, Treasury and Homeland Security to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ease restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on travel and remittances to Cuba. The regulations built off of those <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009, which eased travel and remittances restrictions for Cuban Americans and their families in Cuba only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15842&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] Thursday that the upcoming elections in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html">Burundi</a> [CIA backgrounder] place the nation at a critical moment in history, with an opportunity to choose free and fair elections to "strengthen and mature Burundi's still fragile democracy, and enable an improvement in its dire socio-economic situation." Speaking at a press conference during his mission to Burundi, Zeid urged the incumbent administration and opposition parties to proceed with civility and place the good of the country above themselves, and stated that the nation's culture and economy could not afford any more outbreaks of violence. The UN High Commissioner noted that to this point, Burundi has been on a path to greater human rights and democracy, but pointed to recent tensions in the buildup to elections, to take place between May and August, as cause for concern. </p>

<p>Although Burundi has recently adopted various treaties pledging respect for human rights, there have been a string of accusations against Burundi for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">committed</a> [JURIST report] at least 47 extrajudicial executions following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. Earlier that month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about freedom of expression in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine. In November the OHCHR reported that human rights activists in Burundi are <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/burundi-government-hounds-human-rights-activists.php">treated as political opponents</a> [JURIST report] by the state and subject to physical threats, anonymous phone calls, arbitrary arrests, assaults and judicial harassment. In June 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/burundi-passes-media-law-restricting-journalistic-freedom.php">Burundi lawmakers passed</a> [JURIST report] a media law that restricted journalistic freedom by limiting topics that can be reported and reducing the protection afforded to sources. The bill prohibited stories that could affect Burundi's "national unity; public order and security; morality and good conduct; honor and human dignity; national sovereignty; the privacy of individuals; the presumption of innocence" or issues involving "propaganda of the enemy of the Burundian nation in times of peace as of war" and "information that could affect the credit of the state and the national economy." In July 2010 Transparency International <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-ranks-burundi-as-most-corrupt-east-africa-country.php">named</a> [JURIST report] Burundi the most corrupt East-African nation with a corruption index of 36.7 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two UN human rights experts said Thursday that human rights and freedoms should not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism solely because abridging those rights is politically convenient. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a>, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/FreedomReligionIndex.aspx">Heiner Bielefeldt</a> [official profiles], Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, both acknowledged that preserving human rights while countering terrorism is essential to defeating terrorism. UN member states have recognized this theory with <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2010/sc10133.doc.htm">Security Council resolution 1963</a> [text], which says that states cannot solely rely on military force, law enforcement measures, and intelligence operations, and must preserve human rights to counter terrorism. According to the experts, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15846&LangID=E">terrorism is fostered by factors such as</a> [UN report] armed conflict, government corruption or incompetence, extreme poverty, environmental decay, political, economic, cultural and social discrimination, along with prolonged periods of collapsed state or disenfranchised populations. "By actively promoting and protecting human rights, States contribute to preventing terrorism in an effort to address its root causes and risk factors," the experts said, also noting that, "respect for the rule of law, and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential to offer a viable alternative to those who could otherwise be susceptible to terrorist recruitment and to radicalization." The experts said that states should empathize with terrorism victims to provide a sustainable alternative to the violence terrorism offers.</p>

<p>This report is in response to terrorist groups such as the <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder], which has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. Earlier this month IS asserted control over the refugee camp in Yarmouk. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. Also in March the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR jointly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda stated in November that the her office was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters, but said last week that her office <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">lacks jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to open a formal investigation into the group. UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported in December that the IS <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December 2014. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-enacts-strict-anti-terror-legislation.php">UK has enacted an anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] to stop a citizen's re-entry into the country when he or she is suspected of aiding terrorist groups and requiring internet providers to maintain communication data of UK citizens to allow the police to find individuals who may be using certain devices. Civil rights groups have criticized the re-entry provision, stating that it could violate international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.mx/">Mexican Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] approved legislation on Thursday that gives the public access to data from almost all institutions that receive government funding. The legislation <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-congress-expands-reach-freedom-information-law-30381979">passed the lower house of Congress</a> [AP report] 264-68 and will go to the president for his signature. President Enrique Peña Nieto posted on his <a href="https://twitter.com/epn">Twitter account</a> [text, in Spanish] that the measure "will strengthen the accountability of the Mexican government and combat corruption." The legislation expands the ability of Mexican citizens to request information from not just government agencies, but also unions, political parties and government supported councils and commissions. The law also limits the ability of government agencies to skirt information access by defining information as classified.</p>

<p>Mexico is one of 90 nations around the world with a freedom of information act. The UK Freedom of Information Act <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/british-freedom-of-information-act.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in January 2005, four years after its passage by Parliament. The Act, in conjunction with the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act, makes most government documents accessible to citizens through a request process. The UK Supreme Court ruled last month in favor of <em>The Guardian</em>, deciding that the UK newspaper <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/uk-supreme-court-grants-release-of-prince-charles-letters.php">may publish a series of letters</a> [JURIST report] between Prince Charles and high government officials due to the Act. Also in March, a US federal judge ordered the Department of Defense to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dod-ordered-to-release-photographs-of-detainee-abuse-in-iraq-afghanistan.php">turn over photographs</a> [JURIST report] depicting prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan to the ACLU after the organization requested the photos through the Freedom of Information Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukrainian <a href="http://mfa.gov.ua/en/about-mfa/minister/biography">Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin</a> [official website] on Friday stated that his nation has requested an expansion of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] investigation in Ukraine to include recent conflicts in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The nation <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/icc-opens-preliminary-investigation-into-alleged-ukraine-crimes.php">already granted</a> [JURIST report] the ICC permission to investigate crimes on its territory from November 21, 2013, to February 22, 2014, the period leading up to the fall of former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182830">Viktor Yanukovich</a> [BBC profile]. Ukraine now requests that the ICC investigate to the furthest reaches of its <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/UICCEng.pdf">mandate</a> [text, PDF], including looking into allegations that Russia funded pro-separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine soon after Russia <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/">annexed Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. Those conflicts were nominally brought to an end in February of this year with the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31436513">Minsk ceasefire</a> [BBC report], but <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/02/22/the-minsk-ceasefire-has-failed-what-now-for-ukraine/">conflict still remains</a> [Forbes report]. Earlier this week, about 300 US paratroopers arrived in Ukraine to help train the nation's forces to fight pro-Russian rebels, assistance Russia has condemned as "destabilizing." Around 6,000 people have been killed and another 15,000 wounded in the ongoing conflict. </p>

<p>The crisis between Russia and eastern Ukraine has intensified over the past few months with little sign of a true resolution in sight. Earlier this month Amnesty International announced that it has evidence showing that Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-ukraine-rebels-killed-captured-soldiers.php">killed several captured government soldiers</a> [JURIST report], a violation of international humanitarian law. Also this month Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ukraine-president-agrees-to-allow-referendum-on-expanded-autonomy-in-rebel-controlled-east.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his government would no longer object to allowing a referendum that could grant greater autonomy to the eastern regions of the country controlled by Russian-backed rebels. In March Human Rights Watch said that the Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed rebel forces <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-ukraine-government-rebels-using-cluster-munitions.php">consistently used cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] in eastern Ukraine in early 2015, killing close to 13 civilians.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] At the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/congress/">13th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice</a> [official website] on Thursday, the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50602#.VTEnUTrWpUR">announced</a> [press release] that prison overcrowding has reached "epidemic proportions" worldwide. "Prison overcrowding can also be considered as a symptom of a malfunctioning justice system, and the problems of overcrowding have to be dealt with by the prison administration, although the solutions are seldom within their reach," said Piera Barzano, Senior Regional Advisor of the Justice Section at UNODC. "Prison overcrowding impacts the quality of nutrition, sanitation, prisoner-activities, health care services and the care of vulnerable groups. It affects the physical, mental health and well-being of all prisoners. It generates prisoner tension, violence, exacerbates existing mental and physical health problems." Overcrowding refers to prisons where the number of prisoners exceeds the prison's official capacity. According to the UNODC, there are over 10 million people imprisoned across the globe. Last year, 77 countries had a prisoner occupancy rate higher than 120 per cent, and some had a rate as high as 400 per cent. Ms. Barzano indicated that UNODC has worked with the Red Cross to publish a handbook containing strategies to reduce overcrowding in prisons. Miroslawa Czerna of the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [advocacy website] shared Barzano's outrage at many prison conditions, and recognized overcrowding as "a very serious humanitarian concern as it generates substandard and inhumane conditions."</p>

<p>In July, the French Senate <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/france-lawmakers-adopt-measure-to-reduce-prison-overcrowding.php">adopted a measure</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to reduce prison overcrowding. In August 2013 the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/italy-parliament-approves-measure-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">approved a measure</a> [JURIST report] to ease some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe by cutting pre-trial detentions and using alternative punishments for minor offenses. The move came after the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/eu-court-rules-italy-prison-overcrowding-violates-rights.php">ordered Italy to address the problem</a> [JURIST report] within a year. In August 2012 the Colombian Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/colombia-transfers-inmates-to-solve-prison-overcrowding-problem.php">announced a new initiative</a> [JURIST report] to solve the problem of overcrowding in the nation's prisons. In June 2012 UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Kyung-wha Kang <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-official-urges-malawi-to-improve-human-rights-conditions-accountability.php">urged the government of Malawi</a> [JURIST report] to address the problem of prison overcrowding and improve the human rights condition in the country. In April 2012 South Africa <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/south-africa-president-pardons-35000-offenders-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">announced that it will issue pardons</a> [JURIST report] to 35,000 offenders in order to ease prison overcrowding</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US House passes bill to repeal federal estate tax</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Thursday approved the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1105/text">Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015</a> [HR 1105, text], a bill set to end the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Estate-Tax">federal estate tax</a> [IRS overview], by a 240-179 vote. The tax, which Republicans refer to as the death tax, is applied to estates upon passage to an heir after the owner's death. The current top tax rate is 40 percent, but exemptions of $5.43 million for a single person and $10.9 million per couple make it so the tax applies to less than 1 percent of estates. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, should it be passed by the Senate, because it is projected to add $269 billion to the budget over a decade. Without enough votes in the Senate for the measure to pass, however, many analysts believe House Republicans are positioning to make the estate tax an election issue. President Barack Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget">latest budget</a> [2016 budget overview] calls for lowering the per-person exemption to $3.5 million and raising the top tax rate to 45 percent, while doing away with provisions that allow capital gains passed to heirs to escape taxation. Proponents of the bill, such as its sponsor <a href="http://kevinbrady.house.gov/">Representative Kevin Brady</a> [official website], say that the estate tax is mainly felt by small business owners and farmers who have significant asset wealth such as land, but generate little income. Brady stated, "[t]hese are family-owned, hard-working, risk-taking, determined Americans who are building their business, their farm, their ranch. These are not, as we will hear today, the Paris Hiltons and robber barons of the Teddy Roosevelt days." Opponents of the bill, including <a href="http://mcdermott.house.gov/">Representative Jim McDermott</a> [official website], say the bill helps the rich get richer, stating that "[t]his proposed repeal of the estate tax is nothing more than a massive unfunded tax break for a small sliver of America's wealthiest families." </p>

<p>The House vote on HR 1105 ran mostly along partisan lines, with only seven Democrats voting for and three Republicans voting against the bill. The last time the House voted on estate tax repeal, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/8">the measure</a> [HR 8] <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/federal-estate-tax-repeal-approved-in.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] 242-162, with 42 Democrats crossing party lines and voting in favor of the bill. The current model of the estate tax was <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/house-passes-pension-plan-minimum-wage.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, by a 230-180 vote. That <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.05970:">consolidated bill</a> [HR 5970] also increased the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over three years.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Thai Constitution Drafting Committee (CDC) announced on Friday the completion of the first draft of a potential constitutional charter and its submission to an advisory council for review. The new document would replace the one voided nearly a year ago by military coup and could be ratified as soon as September of this year. Should the constitution be ratified, it would become the country's twentieth since 1932. Previous experience over past constitutional and political issues has influenced the drafting of the new charter. The new document seeks to protect against the previous problems of monopolization of power by elected officials, a lack of checks and balances, money politics and corruption by creating unique provisions such as the exclusive appointment of senators by state committees, the possibility of a non-elected person becoming prime minister in an emergency and the creation of a people-centric council meant to check politicians. However, the charter has been criticized as undemocratic for it's distinctive modifications allowing the transfer of power from elected members to the non-elected. </p>

<p>Thailand has experience much upheaval since the military coup of 2014. On May 20 Thailand's armed forces, led by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">General Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile], declared <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-armed-forces-impose-martial-law.php">martial law</a> [JURIST report] and began a regime of censorship. Two days later the military proceeded to take <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">control</a> [JURIST report] of the country and suspend the constitution. The governmental control was followed by the replacement of civilian courts with military tribunals, called <a href="http://news.mthai.com/hot-news/general-news/366959.html">National Council for Peace and Order</a> (NCPO) [MThai report, in Thai]. The military saw themselves validated in late July when the king expressed his <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/thailand-king-endorses-interim-constitution.php">support</a> [JURIST report] for an interim constitution that would award great power to the NCPO. Early this month, the Thai Prime Minister announced that the country will no longer be under martial law, but be governed by a new <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-pm-announces-end-to-martial-law-after-10-months.php">security order</a> [JURIST report] based on an interim constitution that would allow for the apprehension without a warrant for anybody deemed to be a threat to national security by the prime minister. This new order drew the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-concerned-by-thailand-governments-new-security-order.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] of the UN High Commissioner for Human rights, who noted that the new interim constitution is more conducive to wide-scale human rights violations, such as the elimination of freedom of expression and the essential legalization of human rights violations under the authority of the prime minister. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chinese court on Friday <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1767750/veteran-chinese-journalist-gao-yu-be-sentenced-friday">sentenced</a> [press release] 71-year-old freelance journalist Gao Yu to seven years in prison for 'leaking state secrets' to foreign contacts. Yu has been detained since April 2014, and maintains that she is innocent. The sentence has been met with criticism. An official for the <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/china/index_en.htm">European Union Delegation to China</a> [official website] remarked that the sentence "has heightened [the Delegation to China's] concern on the situation of human rights defenders in China, including lawyers and journalists." As Yu was leaving the court after sentencing, she <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/17/us-china-rights-idUSKBN0N806I20150417">reportedly told her lawyer</a> [Reuters report] that she plans to appeal her sentence. According to the <a href="https://www.cpj.org">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website], Yu is <a href="https://www.cpj.org/2015/04/chinese-journalist-gao-yu-sentenced-to-seven-years.php">one of 44 imprisoned journalists</a> [CPJ statement] in China.</p>

<p>Since the appointment of President Xi Jinping in 2013, China has set out on a campaign against corruption. Earlier this month China's former national security chief Zhou Yongkang was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/former-china-security-chief-charged-with-disclosing-state-secrets.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with bribery, abuse of power and disclosing state secrets. Last month the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/china-implicates-14-generals-in-anti-corruption-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the conviction and investigation of 14 generals for corrupt financial practices. In February Chinese officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-to-prosecute-top-parliamentary-official-for-graft.php">announced plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] Su Rong, former vice-chairman of the country's top parliamentary advisory body, for graft, including taking bribes and selling ranks and titles. China has also set out to reform its court system in recent months. Last October China <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/communist-party-of-china-announces-legal-reform-giving-judges-more-independence.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a blueprint for judicial reform aimed at giving judges more independence and limiting the influence of local officials over courts. Guidelines for the reform were <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/china-communist-party-introduces-guidelines-to-strengthen-legal-system.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the following week. In February China's <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn">Supreme People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] announced a five-year comprehensive <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-top-court-announces-five-year-legal-reform-plan.php">legal reform plan</a> [JURIST report] to make the judiciary more impartial, fair, independent and accountable as a way to emphasize the rule of law and "safeguard national unity."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nebraska lawmakers voted 30-13 Thursday in favor of <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=25136">legislation</a> [LB 268 materials] that would repeal the death penalty and replace it with life imprisonment in first-degree murder cases. Nebraska currently has 11 men sitting on death row but no way of executing them because its supply of sodium thiopental expired in December 2013. Thursday's debate included death penalty supporters who told tales of violent killings involving a bank robbery. Senator Ernie Chambers of Omaha, as sponsor of the Nebraska measure, has fought for the last 40 years to eliminate capital punishment. The only time Nebraska Legislature passed a repeal measure was in 1979, but it was vetoed by then governor Charles Thone. The bill must pass through two more rounds of voting in the unicameral legislature, but if support holds up, death penalty opponents would have a sufficient number of votes to supersede a promised veto by <a href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/">Governor Pete Ricketts</a> (R) [official website]. Nebraska last executed someone in 1997. </p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST archive] and execution method issues have been the hot topics of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Earlier this month the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/tennessee-top-court-postpones-executions-to-determine-constitutional-issues.php">postponed the execution</a> [JURIST report] of four inmates on death row while it determines whether current protocols are constitutional, thus effectively halting all executions in the state. Also in April the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the only states with that option. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the epicenter</a> [JURIST report] of the lethal injection drug debate last year after the death of Clayton Lockett, a death row inmate who died of an apparent attack minutes after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of three federal judges for the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] heard arguments on Thursday aiming to block proposed EPA regulations meant to slow climate change. However, the panel abstained making an affirmative action by stating it was procedurally too early to render a decision. The contested rule is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Obama's</a> <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-proposed-rule">Clean Power Plan</a> [official websites], that seeks to achieve a 30% reduction in carbon pollution by 2030 by requiring power plants to turn away from coal-fire power in favor of cleaner burning energy methods. The plaintiffs, which include 12 states and the coal companies, petitioned the courts to block the EPA from finalizing the proposed regulation, arguing that the EPA lacks the authority to issue it. During arguments, two of the three judges on the panel appeared highly skeptical of the plaintiffs' efforts to stop the regulation before it is complete. However, the panel made it clear they would be willing to review the regulation once it is finalized.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] has been in action for decades, seeking to regulate harmful environmental practices. The proposal for the Clean Power Plan was <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/epa-proposes-plan-to-reduce-carbon-emissions.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in early June 2014, and was an effort to establish the first national limits on carbon pollution levels, which would simultaneously improve air quality and reduce power costs. Late last month, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> heard <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-epa-case.php">oral arguments</a> [official website, JURIST report] in three consolidated cases against the EPA which asked the question if the agency unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining their regulations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Supreme Court Justice <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Samuel Alito</a> [official profile] issued a temporary stay on Wednesday preventing the federal government from requiring the Roman Catholic dioceses and its affiliates in Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania to comply with the birth control mandates of the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/where-can-i-read-the-affordable-care-act/">Affordable Care Act</a> [text]. The religious groups petitioned the US Supreme Court for a stay after the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] in February <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/133536p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, pdf] that the federal government could require the Western Pennsylvania dioceses, its faith-based non-profits, and a small Catholic college to provide health insurance that would provide contraception coverage to its employees, or else to require them to sign a statement explicitly opting out. However, the opt-out option would allow an employee to have contraception coverage through their insurers anyway. The Pennsylvania religious groups argued that, even with the opt-out option, the law substantially burdens their religious freedoms by making the diocese complicit in the provision of artificial contraceptives. The order from the US Supreme Court calls for a government response by Monday.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's rulings on the contraceptive mandate and the mandate itself have <a href="/hotline/2014/07/myers-dessalegn-hobby-lobby.php">generated controversy</a> [JURIST op-ed].  The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-exception-requirements-to-contraception-mandate.php">religious non-profit groups' rights were not violated</a> [JURIST report] when required to certify that they are opting out of the <a href="/feature/featured/contraception-mandate/">contraception mandate</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. HHS issued <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/us-government-proposes-changes-to-contraceptive-mandate-exemptions.php">proposed rules</a> [JURIST report] in August in response to the Supreme Court's rulings in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/conestoga-wood-specialties-corp-v-sebelius/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell</a> [SCOTUS backgrounders], which held that "closely held" corporations cannot be required to provide contraceptive coverage to their female workers if the corporation's owners have religious objections. Louise Melling, deputy legal directer of the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/"> American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/supreme-court-allows-employers-discriminate-against-employees-denying-contraception-coverage?redirect=reproductive-freedom/supreme-court-allows-employers-discriminate-against-employees-denying">stated of the court's ruling in Hobby Lobby</a> [press release] that "[r]eligious freedom is a fundamental right, but that freedom does not include the right to impose beliefs on others. In its ruling today, the Court simply got it wrong." Barbara Green, one of the founders of Hobby Lobby,<a href="http://www.hobbylobbycase.com/"> said</a> [press release] that "[o]ur family is overjoyed by the Supreme Court's decision. Today the nation's highest court has re-affirmed the vital importance of religious liberty as one of our country's founding principles. The Court's decision is a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith. We are grateful to God and to those who have supported us on this difficult journey."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/16/azerbaijan-rights-defender-convicted">reported</a> [press release] the conviction of leading human rights activist Rasul Jafarov by a court in Azerbaijan Thursday and called for his immediate release. HRW criticized the arrest and conviction as a government initiative to silence political critics. As the founder and chair of Human Rights Club, Jafarov had been attempting to compile a comprehensive list of Azeri victims of politically motivated arrests prior to his own arrest in August. Giorgi Gogia, senior South Caucasus researcher at Human Rights Watch, said of the conviction, "Jafarov was one of the most authoritative and outspoken critics of politically motivated prosecutions in Azerbaijan, and now he has become a victim of one." The charges against Jafarov were based primarily on Human Rights Club's unregistered state status and include tax evasion, abuse of power, illegal business activities, and embezzlement. The court sentenced him to six and a half years in prison. </p>

<p>The human rights situation in Azerbaijan has drawn heavy criticism from the UN and various rights groups. A <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/azerbaijan?page=1">report</a> [World Report 2015: Azerbaijan] published by HRW reported escalating repression of political critics in 2014 by the Azerbaijani government. In February the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/azerbaijan-court-extends-detention-of-human-rights-activist-without-trial.php">detention</a> [JURIST report] of Azeri human rights activist Leyla Yunus, held without trial since July, was extended an additional five months. Yunus was reportedly working on the comprehensive list of politically motivated arrests in Azerbaijan with Rasul Jafarov. In August the conviction against leading human rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev, also involved in the project with Jafarov and Yunus, was <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/azerbaijan-court-upholds-conviction-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. With the opening of the <a href="http://www.baku2015.com/">European Games</a> [official website] on June 12, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/azerbaijan-urged-to-release-political-prisoners-ahead-of-european-games.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] political leaders across Europe not to endorse the multi-sport event unless the political prisoners are released. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW welcomes Malawi marriage act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malawi enacted the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Act of 2015 (Marriage Act) on Wednesday, a move that <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/17/malawi-new-marriage-law-can-change-lives">welcomed</a> [press release] as "an important step toward preventing child marriage." The act was passed by Parliament in February and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32325177">approved</a> [BBC report] by President Peter Mutharika this week, setting a minimum marrying age of 18 for both boys and girls. It also requires marriages to be registered with the government and gives equal status to husbands and wives, which HRW has commended as a strong protection for women. A widow can now inherit her husband's property if he dies. Additionally, the Marriage Act places financial responsibility on the families of minor boys for children they have while underage. However, HRW is urging the Malawi government to amend its constitution to give full effect to the Marriage Act and to establish provisions requiring full consent of all parties entering marriage. HRW is also advocating for the elimination of provisions in the Marriage Act which discriminate toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people. The act defines marriage as that between people of opposite sexes, defines sex as the sex assigned at birth, and prohibits "unnatural offenses," a provision which could be used to criminalize homosexuality.</p>

<p>Malawi currently has one of the highest rates of child marriages in the world, with approximately half of Malawian women getting married before they reach 18 years of age. Factors that contribute to this high statistic include poverty, lack of education or employment opportunities, and a culture of female subordination. The current constitution permits marriage for children aged 15 to 18 with their parents' consent. In March, HRW called on Malawi to end child and forced marriage in a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-calls-on-malawi-to-end-childhood-marriage.php">report</a> [JURIST report] detailing how child marriage exposes girls to domestic and sexual violence. In recent years child marriage has been criticized in other areas of the world as well. In September Bangladeshi officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/bangladesh-officials-approve-child-marriage-prevention-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Child Marriage Prevention Act of 2014, requiring a two-year jail term for any person who marries a girl under the age of 18. However, in October, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-urges-bangladesh-not-to-lower-marriage-age.php">considering</a> [JURIST report] changing the country's law once again to allow marriage at 16, a move HRW urged against. In December 2011 HRW also called on the government of Yemen to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/rights-group-urges-new-yemen-government-to-raise-legal-marriage-age.php">increase</a> [JURIST report]the minimum age for girls to enter into marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/ohio-voters-gain-greater-access-ballot-aclu-settlement">announced</a> [press release] a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/naacphustedsettlement_agreement.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] Friday over early voting in Ohio. The now settled lawsuit was filed last year by the ACLU challenging the decreased availability of early voting opportunities in the state as a result of the passage of <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/legislation/2013-2014-sb-238">Senate Bill 238</a> [bill summary]. The bill eliminated the "golden week," a six-day window when people were able to both register to vote and cast an early ballot on the same day. The settlement provides an additional Sunday voting opportunity and restores extended evening voting hours for all elections through 2018. </p>

<p>Voting laws have been a contested subject in the US recently, especially voter ID laws. In March the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/aclu-urges-supreme-court-to-review-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a petition</a> asking the US Supreme Court to review the September federal appeals court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-voter-id-law-in-wisconsin.php">upholding</a> [JURIST reports] Wisconsin's voter ID law. Wisconsin's <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23.pdf">Act 23</a> [text, PDF] requires residents to present photo ID to vote. In November a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering to vote. In October the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-allows-texas-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] Texas to enforce a strict 2011 voter ID law requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls. Also in October the <a href="https://courts.arkansas.gov/courts/supreme-court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/arkansas-high-court-declares-voter-id-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a voter ID law finding it unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Argentina's Minister for Issues Relating to the Falkland Islands, <a href="http://www.danielfilmus.com.ar/">Daniel Filmus</a> [official website], announced on Friday the country is beginning legal proceedings against oil and gas companies from the US and UK drilling off of the islands. Filmus <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/17/britain-argentina-oil-idUSL2N0XE18C20150417">claims</a> [Reuters report] that extracting resources from the islands is illegal, saying they belong to Argentina, but UK officials have called the lawsuit a form of bullying. The government of the Falkland Islands <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32354222">agrees</a> [BBC report] with the UK, stating that they have a right to their own economic development and reject the applicability of domestic Argentinian law. Filmus says the court could impose heavy fines and as much as 15 years in prison for the oil and gas companies. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18425572">Falkland Islands</a> [BBC profile], called Las Islas Malvinas by Argentinians, are located in the South-West Atlantic Ocean. The dispute dates back to the 1800s when an island settlement by the newly-formed Argentina was banned by the UK. The UN ordered the two nations to reach an agreement over the territory in 1965, but after years of talks, Argentina sent troops to the island. Between April and June 1982, UK and Argentina fought a war over the territory which led to the deaths of 655 Argentinian and 255 British soldiers. Although Argentina surrendered, the countries have continued to disagree over the islands. In November 2008 the governments of the UK and the Falkland Islands <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/falkland-islands-announces-upcoming-referendum-for-its-sovereignty.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they agreed on a new constitution for the disputed islands. In June 2012 the government of the Falkland Islands announced that it would hold a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/falkland-islands-announces-upcoming-referendum-for-its-sovereignty.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] on its political status and the residents voted overwhelmingly to remain under British control in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Saturday condemned the targeting of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen by combatants. Rebel soldiers and pro-government forces <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rights-group-yemen-fighting-damaged-hospital-30410357">fortified near the hospital</a> [AP report], and the resulting combat forced the hospital to evacuate all but those receiving emergency treatment in violation of the laws of war, according to HRW. The <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC backgrounder] prohibit attacks on medical facilities. HRW urged all parties to the conflict in Yemen <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/17/yemen-fighting-damages-hospital">not to target medical facilities</a> [press release] and personnel, or otherwise disrupt the treatment of patients at hospitals. </p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">situation in Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">news archive</a>] has sparked significant international concern. Earlier this week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">Yemeni combatants to report attacks resulting in civilian casualties</a> [JURIST report] so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Earlier this month UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Oklahoma <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website] on Friday signed into law a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2015-16%20ENGR/hB/HB1879%20ENGR.PDF">bill</a> [HB 1879, PDF] that allows for the use of nitrogen gas in executions if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website], or if the drugs become unavailable. Under this new method, nitrogen would be delivered via face mask, depriving the inmate of oxygen. The nitrogen gas method supplants the old alternative methods of electric chair or firing squad. Fallin <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/17/oklahoma-nitrogen-execution-method-death-penalty">stated</a> [remarks], "I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard." Executions in Oklahoma have been put on hold while the US Supreme Court considers <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], a case determining whether the state's three-drug method of lethal injection violates the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_viii">Eighth Amendment's</a> [text] prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST archive] and execution methods have been at the forefront of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Earlier this month the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty, but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed. Also last month <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-state-attorneys-general-ask-supreme-court-to-ban-oklahoma-execution-drug-cocktail.php">more than a dozen</a> [JURIST report] former state attorneys general asked the US Supreme Court to rule Oklahoma's use of the three-drug execution cocktail unconstitutional. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], Ravina Shamdasani, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15855&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] Friday at the "dire human rights situation" in Ukraine after reports of intensified fighting in violation of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31436513">Minsk Agreement</a> [BBC backgrounder], a ceasefire deal proposed for peace negotiations. Shamdasani indicated that after breaches of this agreement, violations of human rights will become more prevalent. Since breach of the agreement, a large number of civilians have reportedly been killed. The OHCHR recognizes civilian lives as of the utmost importance, so those who have caused recent deaths and deaths and injuries to civilians, in violation of human rights and international law, must be held accountable. The OHCHR called on parties to the agreement to comply with these laws and abide by the terms of the Minsk Agreement. </p>

<p>The crisis between Russia and eastern Ukraine has intensified over the past few months with little sign of a true resolution in sight. Earlier this month Amnesty International (AI) announced that it has evidence showing that Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-ukraine-rebels-killed-captured-soldiers.php">killed several captured government soldiers</a> [JURIST report], a violation of international humanitarian law. Also this month Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ukraine-president-agrees-to-allow-referendum-on-expanded-autonomy-in-rebel-controlled-east.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his government would no longer object to allowing a referendum that could grant greater autonomy to the eastern regions of the country controlled by Russian-backed rebels. In March Human Rights Watch said that the Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed rebel forces <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-ukraine-government-rebels-using-cluster-munitions.php">consistently used cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] in eastern Ukraine in early 2015, killing close to 13 civilians. Last October AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-atrocities-in-eastern-ukraine-must-be-investigated.php">documented extra-judicial killings</a> [JURIST report] by both pro-Russian separatists and pro-Keiv forces in eastern Ukraine, though the advocacy group cautioned that the actual number of deaths might not be an accurate figure as reported by the Russian media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/">Legislative Assembly of El Salvador</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday approved a <a href="/paperchase/elsalvadormarriage/ACUERDO%20No.%204%20-2009-2012.pdf">measure to amend the constitution</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] to limit marriage and adoption to couples with only one man and one woman. The bill would make same-sex marriages made outside of El Salvador have no legal validity in El Salvador. A similar legislative attempt <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/09/rights-el-salvador-anti-gay-reform-fails-in-congress/">failed in 2009</a> [IPS report]. The bill <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/noticias/archivo-de-noticias/acuerdo-para-elevar-a-rango-constitucional-matrimonio-entre-hombre-y-mujer-asi-nacidos">must be ratified by a two-thirds majority</a> [press release, in Spanish] during the 2015-2018 legislative session in order to take effect.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial globally in recent years, particularly in Latin America. Earlier this month, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet signed a law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/chile-president-signs-same-sex-civil-union-law.php">recognizes civil unions between same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report], a move hailed by advocates as a step toward full marriage rights. In 2013 Uruguay joined Argentina as the only South American countries to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-congress-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage.php">legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In May 2012 the City of Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/argentina-district-recognizes-same-sex-marriage-for-foreigners-tourists.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to recognize same-sex marriages for non-citizens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghanistan must strengthen its criminal justice system to provide protection for women victims of domestic violence, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/AF/UNAMA_Afghan_Women15April2015.docx">report</a> [text, DOC] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15861&LangID=E">released</a> [press release] Sunday by the the <a href="http://www.unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites]. The report said only 5 percent of domestic violence cases in the country lead to criminal prosecution, and the majority of cases are handled through mediation, a practice the UN believes should be modified to include greater support for the victims. According to the report, many Afghan women who have experienced violence choose to settle the matter in mediation because they believe the criminal justice system is corrupt and unprofessional. Additionally, many victims are more concerned with civil remedies, such as divorce or custody, and worry about having nowhere to go if they are forced to leave the marital home. The report states laws in Afghanistan do not protect women's property and fail to provide safeguards like protection orders. The report urges the Afghan government to implement policies to protect women against violence, including civil remedies, common standards among the courts, and training staff of men and women to help the victims.</p>

<p>Human rights groups have criticized Afghanistan's record in recent years. Earlier this month an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] report <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Afghanistan women's rights activists are facing increased violence and a lack of governmental support. Last month UNAMA also released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">report</a> [JURIST report] indicating a 22 percent increase in civilian causalities in 2014, making 2014 the deadliest year in Afghanistan since 2009. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-calls-for-protection-of-womens-rights-in-afghanistan.php">called on the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address violence against women in the country. UNAMA and the OHCHR released a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">study</a> [JURIST report] last year that raised concern over the treatment of women in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court has referred 11 men accused of being involved in deadly 2012 soccer riots to the most senior religious official, the final step before imposing a death sentence. The Grand Mufti is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/19/us-egypt-soccer-trial-idUSKBN0NA0A320150419">scheduled to give his final decision</a> [Reuters report] on May 30. The riots, which occurred in Port Said, killed more than 70 and injured about 1,000 others crushed by crowds attempting to leave the stadium when fans of Al-Masry violently stormed the stands and attacked Al-Ahly fans after Al-Masry won the soccer match. Seventy-three people have been <a href="http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150419/1021094312.html">accused</a> [Sputnik report] of involvement in the riots. </p>

<p>In January 2013 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 21 people who were found guilty of involvement in the Port Said soccer stadium disaster to the death penalty. Protesters angry over the verdict later rioted, leading to the deaths of at least 30 people. Then-president Mohamed Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a state of emergency later that week in an attempt to quell the protests. A Cairo court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentences-for-21-involved-in-fatal-soccer-riot.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the death sentences of the 21 individuals in March 2013, and the court handed down verdicts for the remaining 52 defendants also charged in the incident. It is widely believed that police were responsible for causing the riot, during which police reportedly retreated from the crowd and cut electricity to the stadium, leaving many fans to be crushed against locked doors in the darkness. The High Court ordered a retrial for the 21 death sentences a year later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN officials congregating at the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/">13th UN Crime Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice</a> [official website] in Doha, Qatar ,on Saturday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50622#.VTP4-yFVhBc">called on</a> [UN News Centre report] member states to implement new <a href="https://srsg.violenceagainstchildren.org/sites/default/files/documents/docs/Model%20strategies%20and%20practical%20measures%20on%20the%20elimination%20of%20violence%20against%20children%20in%20the%20field%20of%20crime%20prevention%20and%20criminal%20justice.pdf">standards</a> [text, PDF] for eliminating violence against children. The standards were approved by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] in December and are geared toward improving the effectiveness of the criminal justice system's ability to prevent and respond to violence against children. Valerie Lebaux, the Chief of the Justice Section, Division for Operations, in the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] said, "[these strategies represent] an historical achievement and a strong endorsement of the commitment of Member States towards addressing the issue of violence against children. ... Considering the complex nature of the issue, the needs for technical assistance are extensive and cannot be met within a short period of time. ... Our joint efforts are essential to translate the Model Strategies into concrete actions." Additionally, UNODC has entered into a joint global program with the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] to address the issue of violence against children.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/about.shtml">Crime Congress</a> [UN backgrounder] runs through April 19 and takes place a few months before an important summit on the future global development agenda that will occur in September. On Thursday the UNODC reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-drugs-and-crime-office-spotlights-prison-overcrowding-epidemic.php">prison overcrowding has reached "epidemic proportions"</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. "Prison overcrowding can also be considered as a symptom of a malfunctioning justice system, and the problems of overcrowding have to be dealt with by the prison administration, although the solutions are seldom within their reach," said Piera Barzano, Senior Regional Advisor of the Justice Section at UNODC. On Monday Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/rights-groups-less-lethal-weapons-can-have-deadly-consequences.php">said in a briefing</a> [JURIST report] that so-called "less-lethal" weapons used by law enforcement can have deadly consequences, noting, ""[p]olice force and prison officials have at their disposal a dizzying array of weapons and kit that, while known as 'less-lethal,' can cause serious injury or even death. ... [B]ody-worn electric shock devices, spiked batons, and thumb cuffs have no place in policing." Last Sunday UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-sg-speaks-to-crime-congress-highlights-crucial-connection-between-rule-of-law-and-sustainable-dev.php">addressed</a> [JURIST report] the Crime Congress, highlighting the crucial connection between the rule of law and sustainable development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Sunday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/19/egypt-scant-evidence-mass-convictions">criticized</a> [press release] the mass trial of 51 Muslim Brotherhood supporters, claiming that the government presented no evidence of a crime being committed by the men other than the testimony of a single police officer. Specifically they noted that the only evidence presented shows that the men were only spreading news about and organizing peaceful protests. On April 11 the court convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egyptian-court-sentences-us-citizen-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] 14 of the 51 men and gave the 37 others life sentences for organizing opposition to the military's removal of ex-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] in July 2013. The charges included publishing false news stories and conspiring to overthrow the government. The protests in Cairo's Rab'a al-Adawiya Square on August 14, 2013, were violently broken up by security forces and resulted in the deaths of more than 800 peaceful protesters. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director, stated, "The fact that people who covered and publicized the mass killings in 2013 could go to prison for life or be executed while the killers walk free captures the abject politicization of justice in Egypt."</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Earlier this month an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-prosecutor-refers-187-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-to-military-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] 187 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to a military court. The supporters are accused of killing police officers while storming a Maghagha police station in the southern province of Minya in August 2013, only weeks after the removal of Morsi. In late March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted 68 people</a> [JURIST report], including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In closing remarks at the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/">13th UN Crime Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice</a> [official website] Sunday in Doha, Qatar, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] Yury Fedotov <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50627#.VTT-mvnF8Wk">called on</a> [UN NewsCentre report] member states to implement the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/congress//Documentation/ACONF222_L6_e_V1502120.pdf">Doha Declaration</a> [text, PDF] to combat transnational crime and bolster criminal justice systems around the globe. The declaration on "integrating crime prevention and criminal justice into the wider United Nations agenda to address social and economic challenges and to promote the rule of law at the national and international levels, and public participation" was unanimously adopted at the opening of the Congress on April 12. Fedotov <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2015/April/13th-un-crime-congress-closes-with-vow-to-implement-doha-declaration-for-crimes-victims.html?ref=fs1">urged</a> [press release] the representatives from 149 member states to fully embrace the recommendations in the declaration, stating, "[a]s you take the journey back to your capitals and to your homes, I call on you, in the name of justice and fairness, and human rights, to turn this powerful document into the action that can help people ... everywhere." Fedotov also acknowledged the recent migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean citing the events as a compelling example of the need for adopting the Doha Declaration. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/crimecongress2015/about.shtml">Crime Congress</a> [UN backgrounder] ran from April 12 through the 19 a few months before an important summit on the future global development agenda that will occur in September. At the same Congress earlier this week, delegates <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-urge-new-standards-for-eliminating-violence-against-children.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] member states to implement <a href="https://srsg.violenceagainstchildren.org/sites/default/files/documents/docs/Model%20strategies%20and%20practical%20measures%20on%20the%20elimination%20of%20violence%20against%20children%20in%20the%20field%20of%20crime%20prevention%20and%20criminal%20justice.pdf">new standards</a> [text, PDF] for eliminating violence against children.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian Criminal Court in Giza on Monday sentenced 22 people to death for their involvement in the storming of a police station and killing of an officer on the day Mohamed Morsi was overthrown. The defendants are <a href="http://wkrn.membercenter.worldnow.com/story/28843570/egypt-court-sentences-22-to-death-over-2013-attack-on-police">alleged</a> [AP report] to be Morsi supporters and members of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The charges on which the defendants were convicted include murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, destruction of property and vandalism. Eight of the defendants were sentenced <em>in absentia</em>, and the ruling is subject to appeal.</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Earlier this month an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-prosecutor-refers-187-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-to-military-court.php">referred </a>[JURIST report] 187 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to a military court. The supporters are accused of killing police officers while storming a Maghagha police station in the southern province of Minya in August 2013, only weeks after the removal of Morsi. In late March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted 68 people</a> [JURIST report], including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042015zor_8758.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in appeal brought by Rajat Gupta, the former director of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for his 2012 insider trading conviction. The <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015_03_31-Reply-Brief-for-Petitioner_144057333_1.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] submitted to the Supreme Court argued erroneous utilization of Federal Rule of Evidence 403 and noted a circuit split on jury instructions for character evidence. Gupta appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] early last year, but his conviction was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-insider-trading-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. This is the second time the Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal brought by Gupta, the first being a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-rejects-appeal-by-ex-goldman-sachs-director.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] to a permanent ban from acting as a public company officer brought January of this year. </p>

<p>Gupta was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/former-goldman-sachs-director-convicted-of-fraud.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in June 2012. The convictions rested largely on telephone conversations between Gupta and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive], head of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm where Gupta disclosed financial and investor information of Goldman Sachs. Gupta was sentenced  to two years in prison, one of supervised release, and ordered to pay $5 million dollars in fines. Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> in 2011 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 11 years in prison and $64 million dollars in fines, the largest sentence to ever be awarded for insider trading. Rajaratam appealed to the Second Circuit in 2013, but the conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-hedge-fund-managers-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kuwait's supreme court on Monday ordered the release on bail of former opposition leader <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/who-is-musallam-al-barrak-1.1095928">Musallam al-Barrak</a> [Gulf News profile], accused of insulting the country's leader. Al-Barrak has a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/top-court-frees-leading-kuwait-opposition-figure-bail-30440213">hearing scheduled for May 18</a> [AP report] in which the court will render a final judgment on his charges. Bail was set at 1,000 dinars (USD $3,310). Al-Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 after a public speech was found to contain remarks detrimental to the "social and political balance of the country." The remarks came during a boycott movement led by al-Barrak against a controversial election law that the opposition claims is illegal and will establish a rubber stamp parliament. </p>

<p>Throughout the years the Kuwaiti government has been criticized for restricting rights to assembly and for prohibitions of free speech in the country. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that riot police in Kuwait disbanded protests <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/jurist-riot-police-in-kuwait.php">arresting 16 protesters</a> [JURIST report] who may be charged with attacking law enforcement officers and illegal gathering. In January Nabil al-Fadhl, a member of the Kuwait parliament, was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-lawmaker-facing-legal-action-for-supporting-sale-of-alcohol.php">charged with insulting</a> [JURIST report] the honor of Kuwaiti society and history after making a comment in support of the legalized sale of alcohol. Also in January Kuwaiti authorities ordered the 10-day detainment of former lawmaker <a href="https://twitter.com/SalehAlmulla">Saleh al-Mullah</a> [personal Twitter account, in Arabic] for tweets <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-authorities-detain-former-lawmaker-for-tweets-critical-of-egypt.php">criticizing</a> [JURIST report] the Gulf country's leader <a href="http://www.da.gov.kw/eng/picsandevents/amir15.php">Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah</a> [official website] and his support for Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Later that month a Kuwaiti appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-court-upholds-prison-sentence-for-insulting-ruler-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling that sentenced a man to five years in prison for posting comments about the Gulf nation's ruler on Twitter. A court in Kuwait last October <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/kuwait-sentences-13-to-jail-for-reciting-opposition-speech.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 13 people of challenging the country's ruler by reciting a speech by al-Barrak. In July 2013 Kuwait's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/kuwait-top-court-upholds-10-year-sentence-for-twitter-user.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a 10-year prison sentence for a man accused of posting Tweets insulting the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/muhammad_1.shtml">Prophet Mohammed</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/subdivisions/sunnishia_1.shtml">Sunni Muslim</a> [BBC backgrounders] rulers of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042015zor_8758.pdf">threw out</a> [order list, PDF] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers. The case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dickson-v-rucho/">Dickson v. Rucho</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], was remanded to the <a href="http://www.nccourts.org/courts/appellate/supreme/">Supreme Court of North Carolina</a> [official website] for further consideration in light of a similar ruling issued last month by the Supreme Court in <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lower-court-erred-in-upholding-alabama-redistricting-plan.php">Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama</a> [JURIST report]. North Carolina's Supreme Court will re-hear the case to decide whether the legislature relied too heavily on race when it redrew voting districts after the 2010 consensus. Advocacy groups and Democratic voters argue that oddly shaped districts created clusters of Democratic-leaning black voters, benefiting Republicans elsewhere in the state.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</span>, the Supreme Court said the lower court used the wrong test in upholding legislative districts and determining that race was not a primary motivating factor in drawing district lines. The Supreme Court avoided ruling on the lawfulness or constitutionality, and remanded the case to the lower court. It noted that the court should have asked "the extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minority's present ability to elect the candidate of its choice." The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-redistricting.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on Alabama's redistricting plan in November, at which time the court seemed divided over the issue with some confusion about when race can be appropriately used in redistricting plans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15865&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] the EU on Monday that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. The experts said they were encouraged by the decision to hold an EU summit on the issue and urged states to use the summit to tackle the issues in a way that would comply with their international human rights obligations. Monday's statement comes in response to the more than 1,000 deaths of irregular migrants that have occurred at sea in the past week. UN experts stated that front-line states, like Italy, should not be left with the sole responsibility of saving lives and that Europe needs to create innovative mobility avenues that will incentivize migrants to avoid having to resort to smugglers to get them into the country or other perilous routes. UN experts recommended that Europe create safe legal channels for migration so migrants can be registered, provided with information on labor markets, and be warned of the risks of irregular migration. The UN hopes that this will lead to more migrants finding legal ways to enter Europe and will reduce the number of illegal border crossings through criminal smuggling rings. </p>

<p>Immigration reform has been an area of major political concern in a number of countries across the globe. In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the EU's failure to prevent migrant casualties at sea. Also in February a UN rights expert advised the EU to bank on the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-calls-on-european-leaders-to-bank-on-mobility-of-migrants.php">continued mobility of migrants</a> [JURIST report]. In November UK Prime Minister David Cameron raised the possibility of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/uk-pm-threatens-to-leave-eu-if-no-welfare-payments-changes-allowed.php">UK leaving the EU</a> [JURIST report] if other member state leaders block plans to restrict access to welfare payments for migrants. Cameron outlined proposed welfare reform that would block European migrants to the UK from receiving welfare payments or state housing until they have been UK residents for four years. Also in November US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">announced executive action</a> [JURIST report] on immigration that would allow 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the US. In October a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-expert-criticizes-uk-for-halting-search-and-rescue-efforts-in-mediterranean.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] British authorities to reconsider their decision not to support search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. In September the Israeli High Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/israeli-court-orders-shut-down-of-detention-center-for-african-migrants.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a detention center used to detain African migrants who had crossed illegally and were captured in the Negev Desert to close.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Somali government officials <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/20/somalia-forced-evictions-displaced-people">evicted</a> [HRW report] thousands of displaced people from Mogadishu in early March, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] stated Monday. The Somali government order stated that people were to be evicted from a 600-650 meter section of Mogadishu within a week. Security forces reportedly beat residents resisting the eviction, destroyed all their shelters and threatened individuals. The displaced population is made of about 1.1 million individuals displaced by the 2011 famine and fighting. According to HRW, the displaced people have been subject to numerous abuses, including rape, physical attacks, restrictions on access to humanitarian aid and discrimination. The displaced are now congregating in an area called the Afgooye corridor where HRW says they do not have clean water or sanitary facilities, and there are increased security concerns. International laws dictate that displacing individuals requires a lawful reason, like public interest, and that displacement must be carried out with proper notification and due process protections. After displacement, individuals must be given alternative housing with access to food, education, health care, employment and other opportunities. HRW argues that Somali authorities should cease evictions and assist the displaced people while protecting their rights.</p>

<p>The country of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Somalia">Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive] has been in turmoil for years due to issues of poverty, hunger and war. In February Somalia's prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/somalia-prime-minister-urges-us-banks-to-resume-money-transfers.php">appealed to the US government and US banks</a> [JURIST report] to resume allowing money transfers to Somalia, a crucial service for many in the war-torn country. Earlier in February the Spanish National Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spanish-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six Somali pirates to 16 years in prison for an October 2012 attack on the Spanish boat Izurdia. In November 2014 the UN Security Council <a href="paperchase/2014/11/UN-renews-resolution-to-fight-piracy-off-Somali-coast.php">unanimously adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] renewing its international call to fight piracy off the coast of Somalia. In August a Somali police official reported that security forces <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/security-forces-arrest-somali-pirate-commander.php">arrested Somali pirate</a> [JURIST report] Mohamed Garfanji. Garfanji, second-in-command of Somalia's pirate industry, was arrested for possessing illegal arms and other charges related to piracy. In April 2014 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-urges-death-penalty-moratorium-in-Somalia.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Somali authorities to place a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042015zor_8758.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list] in a case in which relatives of guerrilla conflict victims in Colombia sought to sue <a href="www.chiquitabrands.com">Chiquita Brand International</a> [corporate website] for human rights abuses. Family members of several thousand victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/chiquita-sued-in-us-court-for-aiding.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010 against Chiquita Brand International, which has admitted to funding <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11400950">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [BBC backgrounder], a right-wing paramilitary group. Chiquita admitted to making payments to paramilitaries but argued it was a victim of extortion and was not responsible for any crimes, including torture and murder, committed by the paramilitaries. The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] threw out the charges against Chiquita last year, <a href="http://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/12-14898/12-14898-2014-07-24.pdf?ts=1411128933">finding</a> [opinion, PDF]  that American courts have no jurisdiction because the events in question occurred in Colombia. The Supreme Court's denial to hear the case means that the decision of the appellate court remains in place.  </p>

<p>This is not the first time Chiquita has faced such claims. In February 2010 a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-allows-suit-against.php">federal judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit accusing Chiquita of assisting Marxist rebels who killed Colombian missionaries may go forward. The suit was <a href="www.palmbeachpost.com/news/judge-rules-families-can-proceed-with-suit-against-214454.html">brought</a> [Palm Beach Post report] by family members of five North American missionaries who had worked for the <a href="www.palmbeachpost.com/news/judge-rules-families-can-proceed-with-suit-against-214454.html">New Tribes Mission</a> (NTM) [mission website] in South America and were killed in separate incidents between 1995 and 1996. Chiquita admitted it had paid AUC for protection of its workers, but it argued that it did not condone the killings. In 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after admitting to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to AUC. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-7120_4f15.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] Monday on whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun should be considered a violent felony under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [text]. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/johnson-v-united-states-3/">Johnson v. US</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court specifically is considering whether the residual clause in the ACCA is constitutionally vague. The ACCA stipulates that a mandatory 15-year sentence be imposed for anyone unlawfully possessing a firearm who has three prior "violent felony" convictions. However, the vagueness that is being contested comes when the statute attempts to define such felonies. First the statute lists some exemplative crimes such as burglary, arson and crimes involving explosives. Then, in its residual clause, the statute gives a general definition for any felony that "otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another." In Johnson's <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV5/13-7120_supp_pet.authcheckdam.pdf">supplemental brief</a> [brief, PDF], he argued, "The residual clause is unconstitutional across the board." However, the government contended in its <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV5/13-7120_resp_US_supp.authcheckdam.pdf">supplemental brief</a> [brief, PDF] that it is not uncommon for some courts to struggle with statutory language in laws as important as the ACCA, and that there is a test to apply the language set out in the court's previous cases.</p>

<p>This case is the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/04/re-argument-preview-is-possession-of-a-sawed-off-shotgun-a-violent-felony-the-government-is-not-going-down-without-a-fight/">fifth in seven years</a> [SCOTUSblog op-ed] to address ACCA's residual clause. In two previous cases Justice <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Antonin Scalia</a> [official profile] has made suggestions that the clause is indeed vague. However, the majority of the court did not agree with his suggestions. In this case, the court first heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-7120_jhek.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] in November, but ordered re-argument in January. It was when they ordered the re-argument that they directed the parties to address the constitutionally vague question.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] was sentenced to 20 years in prison Tuesday after being convicted of inciting violence and ordering the killing and torturing of protesters in 2012. The court did not <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/egypt-morsi-sentenced-150421063227546.html">convict</a> [Al Jazeera report] Morsi, or any of the 14 other defendants, of murder, which could have resulted in death sentences. The former democratically elected president is currently awaiting verdicts in numerous other cases against him, including charges of <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/morsi-goes-on-trial-over-espionage-allegations.php">espionage and leaking information to Qatar</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/1493/2015/en/">criticized the trial</a> [report] and conviction for being unfair from the start and politically motivated. The rights group called for Morsi to be released or granted a retrial. </p>

<p>Clashes between Morsi supporters, including the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder], and current President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Abdul Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">ouster of Morsi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have resulted in an intense national security campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters. In February four members of the Muslim Brotherhood were <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] for murder and possession of firearms. Earlier in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-retrial-for-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">ordered a retrial</a> [JURIST report] of 36 Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The 36 are among 183 supporters sentenced to death in June in connection with violence following Morsi's ouster. In January security forces <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egypt-authorities-arrest-516-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] 516 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. In August the Supreme Administrative Court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood-political-wing.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-271_j4ek.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in favor of Learjet and other natural gas retail purchasers in their action against interstate natural gas pipeline ONEOK, finding that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-15B">Natural Gas Act</a> [text] does not provide the <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> [official website] exclusive control over the actions of energy firms. Learjet, representing a group of institutions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines, brought suit against pipeline ONEOK for reporting false information affecting natural gas prices. In the 7-2 decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court determined that because the action was targeting practices affecting retail sales, which are "firmly on the States' side of [the jurisdictional] dividing line," and was an area of regulation traditionally relegated to the states, that the federal regulation did not field preempt the state law antitrust claim. The petitioners and government argued that because the Natural Gas Act gives the FERC authority to to determine whether "any rate, charge, or classification ... is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential," Congress implicitly "occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce." Instead, the court held that the act limits FERC's jurisdiction to the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce, leaving to the states regulation of other portions of the industry, including direct sales. The dissent, authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, stated that the opinion gives "the States [the power to] use their antitrust laws to regulate practices already regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whenever 'other considerations ... weigh against a finding of pre-emption.'"</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Western-States-Cert-Petition-FINAL.pdf">granted</a> [petition] <em>certiorari</em> on July 1, 2014, and heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-271_n6io.pdf">oral argument</a> [transcript] on January 15. The case came to the court after the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/In_re_W_States_Wholesale_Natural_Gas_Antitrust_Litig_Learjet_Inc_">reversed</a> [opinion] a decision by the <a href="http://www.nvd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nevada</a> [official website] <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/nevada/nvdce/2:2006cv00233/47062/272/0.pdf?ts=1376969177.%20%20715%20F.3d%20716%20(9th%20Cir.%202013)">granting</a> [opinion] summary judgment in favor of the defendant natural gas pipelines. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Oskar Groening, a former Auschwitz guard, admitted in his opening statement before a court in Germany Tuesday that he shared the burden of moral guilt for his role at Auschwitz, which earned him the title, "Accountant of Auschwitz," but left it to the judges to determine if his actions were sufficient to be convicted as an accessory to murder. Groening, now 93, collected and tallied belongings stolen from people entering Auschwitz from 1942-44. He is <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with 300,000 counts of accessory murder for supporting the Nazi efforts economically and processing the belongings of the victims. The court ruling will determine if anyone stationed at the Nazi death camp is complicit in the atrocities that took place there. If found guilty, Groening faces a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/04/21/uk-germany-nazi-trial-idUKKBN0NC05V20150421">maximum of 15 years in prison</a> [Reuters report].</p>

<p>Despite the age of the accused, the <a href="http://www.zentrale-stelle.de/pb/,Lde/Startseite">Nazi crime investigation unit</a> [official website, in German] is dedicated to prosecuting the few remaining living Nazi war criminals who have escaped justice. There are currently 11 other proceedings taking place against former Nazi officers on charges of accessory to murder. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/germany-court-dismisses-case-against-former-nazi-solider.php">threw out a case</a> [JURIST report] against a former SS soldier who was accused of being involved in the largest massacre in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. In 2013 German prosecutors brought a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/trial-of-92-year-old-former-nazi-begins-in-germany--dnp.php">92-year-old former Nazi to trial</a> whose case was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/germany-court-drops-case-against-92-year-old-former-nazi.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports] in January due to too many gaps in the evidence. January marked the seventieth anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-chief-marks-anniversary-of-auschwitz-death-camp-liberation.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that the world is still haunted by the tragic events of the Holocaust and continued discrimination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled Tuesday that extending an already completed traffic stop in order to conduct a drug sniff violates the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Constitution</a> [text] as an unreasonable seizure. In a 6-3 decision by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the majority held in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-9972_p8k0.pdf">Rodriguez v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF] that "a seizure justified only by a police-observed traffic violation, therefore, 'become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete th[e] mission' of issuing a ticket for the violation." Dennys Rodriguez, stopped and warned by Officer Morgan Struble for driving on the shoulder, was detained after refusing to consent to a drug sniff following the conclusion of the traffic stop. Upon conducting the sniff, officers found methamphetamine in the vehicle. In deciding the case, the court relied on precedent set in 2005 in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10622335546539670066&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Illinois v. Caballes</a> [opinion], in which the court determined that a traffic stop is only warranted as long as it takes to complete the "mission," in this case to ticket Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder. Any detention beyond that mission constitutes an unreasonable seizure in violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The court did not determine if reasonable suspicion would permit an officer to extend an already completed stop. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that the officer had suspicion to subject Rodriguez to a search, and read <span class="casename">Cabellas</span> as permitting the action taken in this case. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a separate dissent, stating that the decision was arbitrary and hypothetical, as the officer had reasonable suspicion upon which to base the drug sniff. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in October and heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-9972_1a7d.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] in January. The case came to the court after the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13-9972-opbelow.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the determination by the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] that the prolonged stop was a <em>de minimis</em> intrusion upon Rodriguez's personal liberty, sentencing him to five years in prison. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-21-15.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-378_2b8e.pdf">McFadden v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">report</a>] to determine what level of knowledge is required for a narcotics conviction. The question originally before the court was whether, to convict a defendant of distribution of a controlled substance analogue, the government must prove that the defendant knew that the substance constituted a controlled substance analogue. A controlled substance analogue is a substance with a chemical structure that is "substantially similar" to a schedule I or II drug and has a "substantially similar" effect on the user. Stephen McFadden was convicted by a jury of nine charges stemming from his distribution of substances that the government alleged were prohibited by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/802">Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986</a> [21 USC §§ 802(32)(A), 813], and the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3357488043525162287&q=united+states+v.+mcfadden&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_ylo=2014">affirmed</a> [opinion]. As stated by McFadden's attorney Tuesday, both parties now agree that "to prove an offense, the government must show that the defendant knowingly distributed an analogue." However, counsel for McFadden also said Tuesday, "Where we may disagree is over the government's alternative theory that it can instead show that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal or regulated." Counsel for the government responded, "Our position is not that we can prevail if we can prove that the defendant believed that his conduct was illegal under some law other than the CSA or the Analogue Act. Our position is that we can prevail if we can prove that a defendant knowingly distributed a drug and that he believed that his conduct, that his distribution of the drug was illegal, generally."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">General Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddd6db5b133bab44bca85fad0227633e64.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuPchf0?text=&docid=163863&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=225281">upheld</a> [decision] sanctions placed on individuals and companies in Zimbabwe. The action, brought in 2012 by Zimbabwe's Attorney-General Johannes Tomana and 120 other individuals, challenged sanctions first imposed in 2002 as a result of the EU's concerns regarding pre-election violence and "serious infringements of human rights" committed by the government of Zimbabwe. The sanctions, which are renewable on a 12-month basis, have mostly been ratcheted back in recent years, with only President Robert Mugabe, his wife and one defense company still subject to the asset freeze and travel ban. The decision can still be appealed to the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The human rights record of Mugabe and his government has triggered numerous sanctions and condemnations from nations and rights groups. In January <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-urges-zimbabwe-president-to-address-african-rights-concerns.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Mugabe to address human rights concerns in Zimbabwe and other parts of the African continent. Also in January Zimbabwe's <a href="http://www.jsc.org.zw/">High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/zimbabwe-court-halts-eviction-of-farmers.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an immediate halt to the demolition of the homes of farmers who were evicted to clear space for a game park envisioned by First Lady Grace Mugabe. In September 2013 the high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/zimbabwe-court-orders-release-of-21-members-of-opposition-party.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of 21 activist members of the opposition party that had been detained for over two years. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4828_en.htm">issued</a> [press release] a Statement of Objection to <a href="http://www.gazprom.com/">Gazprom</a> [corporate website] accusing the Russian gas giant of <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4829_en.htm">abusing its position</a> [EU factsheet] as the dominant source of gas in Central and Eastern European in breach of EU anti-trust rules. According to the Commission, "Gazprom is the dominant gas supplier in a number of Central and Eastern European countries. It has a market share well above 50% and in some cases up to 100% in these markets." Based on preliminary investigation, the European Commission believes Gazprom is breaking EU antitrust rules by implemeting a strategy to "partition Central and Eastern European" with the goal of perpetuating unfair pricing policies in EU member states. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E102:EN:HTML">Article 102</a> [text] of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits the abuse of a dominant market position, which may affect trade between Member States. Gazprom has 12 weeks to reply to the Statement of Objections.</p>

<p>The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has been at the forefront of combating unfair business practices. Last week the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/eu-initiates-antitrust-proceedings-against-google.php">initiated</a> [JURIST report] antitrust proceedings against <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> [corporate website] accusing the company of utilizing their dominant position in the search engine market to hurt competitors. In March the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/eu-unveils-draft-legislation-requiring-automatic-exchange-of-tax-rulings.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a package of proposed legislation aimed at combating tax deals between individual EU member states and multinational companies. In October the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/eu-commission-sues-sweden-for-online-betting-and-poker-laws.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Sweden for failing to change its laws on online betting and poker games that breach EU law on the free movement of services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Tennessee lawmakers on Tuesday approved two measures that, if signed into law, will require state abortion clinics to be licensed as surgical centers and require women to wait 48 hours after receiving counseling before being able to get an abortion. The measures have been sent to Republican <a href="http://www.tn.gov/governor/">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website], who is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/22/usa-abortion-tennessee-idUSL1N0XJ0IV20150422">expected to sign</a> [Reuters report] them into law. The 48-hour waiting period was approved in a 79-18 vote, and the new clinic regulations were approved 79-17. Despite the wide margin in the votes, there was still <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/21/abortion-bills-head-governors-desk/26125037/">contention</a> [<em>The Tennessean</em> report] among legislators on the subject. Democratic Representative John Ray Clemmons stated, "The ultimate effect of this is putting an obstacle in the path of a woman seeking to exercise her constitutional right to an abortion." Republican supporters of the measures, however, insist that the proposed requirements are meant to protect women's health. According to the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/">Guttmacher Institute</a> [website], 22 states currently require centers performing abortions to meet ambulatory surgical center standards and 26 states require waiting periods. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to be a hotly debated legal issue throughout the US, with a number of state legislatures proposing laws to limit abortion. This month Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill</a> to ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Also in April Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. Earlier this month Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/wisconsin-ag-appeals-abortion-ruling.php">appealed</a >[JURIST report] a federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1074_09m1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that time limits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FTCA) [28 USC § 2401(b)] are subject to equitable tolling. In a 5-4 vote in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-june/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">United States v. June</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-wong/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">United States v. Wong</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders], the justices <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/high-court-makes-it-easier-to-sue-government-for-negligence/2015/04/22/3fcee5f0-e8fb-11e4-8581-633c536add4b_story.html">ruled</a> [AP report] that the deadline for filing suit against the federal government for negligence could be extended if plaintiffs have made an effort to comply or failed to learn about important information prior to a deadline. The cases were combined in a majority opinion by Justice Elena Kagan who wrote that Congress did not clearly state when passing the FTCA that it wanted deadlines to be firm, saying, "The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits, nothing more." </p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-time-limit-for-suing-us-government.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December concerning time bars for filing claims against the US government under the FTCA.  In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-1074_m64n.pdf">United States v. Wong</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether the six-month time bar for filing suit in federal court under the FTCA is subject to equitable tolling. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Kwai_Fun_Wong_v_Beebe_732_F3d_1030_9th_Cir_2013_Court_Opinion">held</a> [opinion] "that § 2401(b) is not "jurisdictional," and that equitable tolling is available under the circumstances presented in this case." In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-1075_gebh.pdf">United States v. June</a> [transcript, PDF] the court considered a similar question: "Whether the two-year time limit for filing an administrative claim with the appropriate federal agency under the [FTCA] ... is subject to equitable tolling." The Ninth Circuit had reached the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/June_v_United_States_1117776_DC_No_211cv00901SRB_2013_BL_355595_9">same conclusion</a> [opinion] in light of its ruling in <span class="casename">Wong</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Department of Agriculture</a> [transcript, PDF] over a government program that requires California raisin farmers to turn over a portion of their crop. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA) and the California Raisin Marketing Order require raisin growers to turn over a percentage of their crop to the federal government to stabilize prices. Petitioners, a group of California raisin growers, refused to turn over their crops and sought judicial review of fines imposed by the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website], claiming a <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_viii">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] violation. The questions before the court are:<blockquote><ol><br />
	<li>Whether the government&#8217;s "categorical duty" under the Fifth Amendment to pay just compensation when it "physically takes possession of an interest in property" ... applies only to real property and not to personal property.</li><br />
	<li>Whether the government may avoid the categorical duty to pay just compensation for a physical taking of property by reserving to the property owner a contingent interest in a portion of the value of the property, set at the government&#8217;s discretion.</li><br />
	<li>Whether a governmental mandate to relinquish specific, identifiable property as a "condition" on permission to engage in commerce effects a per se taking.</li><br />
</ol></blockquote>At oral argument Wednesday, the justices seemed <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-california-raisins-20150422-story.html">prepared to rule in favor of petitioners</a> [LAT report]. </p>

<p>The court previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-in-california-raisins-takings-case.php">ruled in this case in 2013</a> [JURIST report], finding that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction to review petitioners' takings claim. The Ninth Circuit had held that petitioners were required to bring their takings claim in the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to review petitioners' claim. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court disagreed: "Petitioners' takings claim, raised as an affirmative defense to the agency's enforcement action, was properly before the court because the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over takings claims brought by raisin handlers." The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top UN human rights officials and the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/home">International Organization for Migration</a> (IOM) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/5538d9079.html">joint statement</a> [text] Thursday calling on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. The statement, signed by UN High Commissioner for Refugees <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c8.html">Antonio Guterres</a>, UN human rights chief <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a>, UN Special representative for migration <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/partners/srsg.shtml">Peter Sutherland</a> and Director General of the IOM <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/director-general">William Lacy Swing</a> [official profiles], criticized the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4813_en.htm">10-point plan</a> [text] generated by the EU earlier this week, arguing that the EU plan focuses too heavily on stemming the arrival of migrants and refugees rather than "the safety, protection needs, and human rights of all migrants and refugees." The statement urges the EU to establish "robust, proactive, and well-resourced search-and-rescue operation" and commit to creating sufficient new channels for safe migration so to receive significantly higher numbers of refugees.</p>

<p>Refuges from the conflicts in the Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. Earlier this week UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-court-opens-investigation-into-cueta-migrant-drowning-incident.php">accused</a> 16 civil guards of using excessive force against 15 sub-Saharan immigrants who drowned attempting to swim around a seawall between Ceuta and Morocco last February. Also in February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the EU's failure to prevent migrant casualties at sea. The statement comes amid reports that as many as 300 migrants may have died off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The current government of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13150040">Central African Republic</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=car">news archive</a>], the National Transition Council, voted Wednesday to create a Special Criminal Court. The new judicial entity is <a href="http://en.starafrica.com/news/car-creates-special-court-to-help-end-impunity.html">to be made up of</a> [StarAfrica report] 27 judges, including 14 from CAR and 13 from other countries. The creation of the special criminal tribunal has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/20/why-special-criminal-court-central-african-republic-deserves-your-support">garnered strong support</a> [HRW report] from international and African human rights groups, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which have viewed the body as the best method of combating the atrocities committed during recent unrest in the country which has left thousands dead and many more displaced.</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR for the past two years, escalating after the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted the government of Bozize in March 2013. According to UN estimates, nearly 440,000 people remain displaced in the country while 190,000 others have sought asylum outside its borders. In January members of a UN investigatory commission reported that crimes against humanity have been widely committed by all parties to the conflict in the CAR and <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-investigators-urge-creation-of-war-crimes-tribunal-for-car.php">called for the establishment of an international court</a> [JURIST report] to objectively investigate and prosecute perpetrators of these crimes. Earlier in January the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-concludes-war-crimes-in-car-not-genocide.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that the acts committed in the CAR constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity but not genocide. Despite this finding, members of the international community maintain that there is <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">much work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation. In September the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-prosecutor-opens-second-investigation-into-central-african-republic-war-crimes.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] a second investigation into CAR war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The parents of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=michael+brown">Michael Brown</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/michael-browns-family-files-civil-lawsuit-against-ferguson/">filed a civil lawsuit</a> [complaint] Thursday under Missouri's wrongful death statute against the city of <a href="http://www.fergusoncity.com">Ferguson, Missouri</a> [official website]. In addition to the city of Ferguson, the complaint also names former police chief Thomas Jackson, and former police officer Darren Wilson as defendants in the suit. The complaint asserts that Michael Brown was "unjustifiably shot and killed ... using an unnecessary and unreasonable amount of force in violation of [Brown's] constitutionally guaranteed right to life ... [as well as] his well-established civil rights protected both by the [US] Constitution and the state of Missouri Constitution." Through the lawsuit, the Brown family is seeking financial compensation for damages suffered, as well as attorneys fees and costs, and declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>

<p>The Ferguson Police Department has been heavily criticized after the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown last August and the police response to protests. The US Department of Justice report released in March <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-report-no-prosecution-of-ferguson-police-officer.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] the former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson from federal prosecution for Brown's death. Former <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] additionally stated that the report <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-holder-delivers-update-investigations-ferguson-missouri">shows</a> [press release] that racial disparities in police practices could not be alternatively explained other than through racial bias, which he says is proven through statistics and an examination of records and emails. Last October Amnesty International reported that police in Ferguson committed human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">abuses</a> [JURIST report] against peaceful protesters last August. Also in October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a tactic employed by the Ferguson police to control protesters, in which protesters had to constantly keep moving, is unconstitutional because it prevented protesters from peacefully assembling on public sidewalks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The systematic anti-foreigner language used in British tabloids for decades, and a recent article in <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/">The Sun</a> [media website] calling migrants "cockroaches," moved the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to take action on Friday, calling on UK officials and the media to curb incitement to hatred. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx">called on EU countries</a> [press release] to take a firm stance on xenophobia and racism, which he said is flourishing under the guise of freedom of expression, to halt the cycle of intolerance of migrants and other marginalized European minorities. An article by a <em>Sun</em> columnist on April 17 entitled "I would use gunships to stop migrants" began with the worlds "Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don't care." The columnist continued to describe the migrants as "a plague of feral humans" turning some British towns into "festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers shelling out benefits like Monopoly money." She also spoke of drilling holes in the bottom of migrant vessels. The column was published two days before a migrant boat from Libya capsized in the Mediterranean, claiming about 800 lives. The UN human rights chief said the language used in such xenophobic articles is similar language used by Nazi propagandists and some Rwandan media outlets during the 1994 genocide. Article 19 of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20999/volume-999-I-14668-English.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text, PDF] protects freedom of speech, but Zeid argues that the right is not absolute. Article 20 of the same Covenant says, "Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law."</p>

<p>Refuges from the conflicts in the Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. Earlier this week UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. UN officials called on the EU to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">create a new rescue operation program</a> [JURIST report] for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. In February a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-court-opens-investigation-into-cueta-migrant-drowning-incident.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] 16 civil guards of using excessive force against 15 sub-Saharan immigrants who drowned attempting to swim around a seawall between Ceuta and Morocco last February. Also in February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the EU's failure to prevent migrant casualties at sea. The statement comes amid reports that as many as 300 migrants may have died off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Romanian court sentenced former Senior Judge Stan Mustata to 10 years and eight months in prison on Friday for granting favorable verdicts to defendants in exchange for money. Mustata was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/world/301195411.html">convicted of six counts</a> [AP report] of taking bribes from October 2013 until his arrest in April 2014. Mustata claims to have been inebriated when some of the exchanges took place. The <a href="http://www.just.ro/">Bucharest Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Romanian], the same court on which Mustata once sat, also banned Mustata from the profession for five years, but he has the right to appeal. Another Romanian judge was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/romania-judge-sentenced-for-accepting-bribes.php">sentenced to 22 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison in February for several instances of taking bribes from wealthy Romanian businessman in exchange for ruling in their favor in court.</p>

<p>Romania is one of the most corrupt nations in the EU, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#ROU_DataResearch_SurveysIndices">ranking</a> [TI profile] 69 out of the 177 nations globally according the watchdog group <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/">German Parliament</a> [official website] on Friday approved a <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/documents/kw17_armenier/371446">resolution</a> [press release] declaring the killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces during World War I a "genocide." The resolution's approval, which coincides with the centenary of the start of the killings, was led by President of the Bundestag <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/lammert_neu/lammert/246232">Norbert Lammert</a> [official website], who believes that Turkey must join Germany in reconciling with the world for the prior acts of genocide of the past. Lammert stated in regards to shared reconciliation, "[t]he unparalleled experiences of violence in the 20th century have ensured that we know there can be no real peace until the victims, their relatives and descendants experience justice: through remembrance of the events." The Bundestag also noted the global issues today of political, ethnic and religious prosecution and how the world must continue to fight these actions against humanity to not repeat mistakes of the past. </p>

<p>In recent years Armenian nationals have fought with the international community to recognize the killing of 1.5 million Armenian citizens as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=armenian+genocide">genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. Turkey has long disputed the numbers, alleging the killings were a result of a civil war that took place after the collapse of the Ottoman empire. In December 2009 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/europe-rights-court-criminal-conviction-for-armenian-genocide-denial-unjustified.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that prosecutions for denying that the killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 was a genocide are an attack on freedom of expression. In 2009 Turkey and Armenia <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/turkey-and-armenia-sign-accord.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a landmark accord in Switzerland to normalize relations between the two countries and open up borders. In 2010 a spokesperson for the US State Department stated that the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">opposed a vote</a> [JURIST report] before the House of Representatives on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [HR 252 materials] branding the World War I-era killings of Armenians by Turkish forces as genocide. In September 2014 the Parliament of Greece ratified a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/greece-parliament-ratifies-bill-criminalizing-armenian-genocide-denial.php">criminalizes the denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US government source on Friday revealed that <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/239-shaker-aamer">Shaker Aamer</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shaker+Aamer">news archive</a>], a Saudi citizen Saudi citizen and former UK resident detained at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder], is expected to be released in June after recent calls from the UK government. Aamer and his counsel had <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/last-former-english-resident-in-guantanamo-bay-requests-release-on-declining-health.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] a federal judge last week to release him on the grounds that he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other illnesses. The undisclosed US source has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3053701/British-Guantanamo-detainee-Shaker-Aamer-freed-June-government-source-claims.html">said</a> [AFP report] that Aamer will be transferred to another country with other released detainees. The US State Department's Special Envoy for the Closing of Guantanamo<a href="https://www.skadden.com/professionals/cliff-sloan">Cliff Sloan</a> [official website] told media that there is no reason Aamer should not be released.</p>

<p>In February the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainees-challenge-to-force-feeding.php#.U0QSz_ldXT8">denied</a> [JURIST report] Aamer and three other detainees their request for injunctive relief to stop prison authorities from force-feeding prisoners to end their hunger strike. Aamer <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/guantanamo-detainee-files-complaint-against-uk-security-forces.php#.U0QU__ldXT-">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in September against UK security forces <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> and <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">MI6</a> [official websites] regarding his treatment while detained by them. In December 2012, Aamer also <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/guantanamo-detainee-launches-defamation-suit-against-uk-agencies.php#.U0QT6_ldXT8">filed a defamation suit</a> [JURIST report] against both agencies. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-chides-prolonged-detention-of-uk-man-in-guantanamo.php#.U0QT7vldXT8">denounced</a> [JURIST report] Aamer's continued detention, calling it a "mockery of justice" in a February 2011 report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/22/yemen-warehouse-strike-threatens-aid-delivery">statement</a> [press release] on Thursday denouncing as a violation of the laws of war an airstrike led by the Saudi Arabian coalition that led to the destruction of a humanitarian warehouse in Yemen earlier this month. The attack was said to be executed by the Saudi coalition, which includes Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, as a response to the ousting of Former President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/02/2012219133034774204.html">Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's</a> [Aljazeera profile]  government in January. The attack destroyed an international aid organization's warehouse, which HRW notes will have far reaching negative effects on the current humanitarian situation in Yemen by diminishing the availability of relief supplies. HRW asserts that the airstrike violated Yemeni <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/06/q-conflict-yemen-and-international-law">laws of war</a> [advocacy website] which prohibit attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate attacks not directed at a specific military objective. The coalition has executed many similar attacks in recent months, and HRW has called for independent investigation by members of each country of the coalition on the alleged war crimes committed by those participating. The United States was also implicated in the attack by the released report. Although not an official member of the coalition, HRW believes that the US was providing logistics and intelligence to the Saudi forces in the form of direct targeting support for airstrikes, and asks the US to disclose their role in the operation. </p>

<p>As the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">crisis in Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder] inches closer to a civil war, the effect on the Yemeni nationals as well as other countries in the region continue to be affected. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> expressed his <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-alarmed-by-rising-civilian-casualties-in-yemen.php">alarm</a> [official profile, JURIST report] over the rising civilian death toll caused by Saudi-led airstrikes. Two days later, the emergency relief coordinator for the <a href="http://www.unocha.org">Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs</a> (OCHA) also expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-relief-chief-calls-for-protection-of-yemeni-citizens.php">concern</a> [official website, JURIST report] about civilian safety in Yemen after reports surfaced of over 500 deaths and thousands of injuries in under two weeks. The following week,a UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons warned about the massive potential <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">displacement</a> [JURIST report] and humanitarian crisis that could result from civilians fleeing Yemen. Shortly after, Pakistani lawmakers passed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] to remain out of the conflict in Yemen, going against Saudi requests for aid in the form of warships, aircrafts and ground troops. That same day, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] on behalf of all US citizens still in Yemen for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. Last week, the High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Yemeni combatants to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">report</a> [JURIST report] attacks resulting in civilian casualties so that they may be properly investigated under human rights law, while HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php">condemned</a> the targeting of a hospital in Yemen by pro-government forces. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nineteen eurozone creditors held a meeting in Latvia on Friday to demand the completion of the economic reform program agreed to by Greece necessary to avoiding a Grecian default or exit from the euro. An <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/eu-finance-ministers-agree-to-extend-greece-bailout.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] between Greece and the creditors in February set an end-of-April deadline for the production of a comprehensive agreed-upon list of reforms; compliance would allow Greece access to the remaining 7.2 billion euros in its bailout fund. However, with the initial deadline rapidly approaching and the failure of Greece to produce agreed-upon reforms, european officials are disenchanted with the delaying tactics expressed by the Greek government. The ministers are now in talks to declaring a new June deadline to allow for a wider time allotment for Greece to make its initial payments. The Greek financial minister seemed confident that a deal would be reached, as all sides agree that they are running out of time. Such a deal could occur on May 11th, the next meeting of the eurozone ministers, and the day before Greece owes a large payment to the International Monetary Fund. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216">debt crisis</a> [BBC timeline] in Greece began in 2009 with a down-grade of a credit rating, and in the following years, has led Greece to borrow hundreds of billions of euros. In January of this year, Greek voters went to the polls in an <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/greeks-vote-in-election-that-could-lead-to-renegotiation-of-bailout-terms.php">election</a> [JURIST report] that saw the leftist party promise to renegotiate terms of the bailout that were seen by many Greek citizens as too harsh. Last month, Greece's parliament passed an <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/greece-parliament-passes-anti-poverty-bill.php">anti-poverty bill</a> [JURIST report] that would provide free electricity and food-stamps to low-income households. While the bill was not approved by Greece's international creditors, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras offered it his support as an action that will offer something to the people. Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/euro-bank-identifies-risks-in-greece-anti-foreclosure-law.php">concerns</a> [official website, JURIST report] about Greece's draft law that prohibits the government from foreclosing on primary residences where borrowers can prove total wealth requirements as ripe for unscrupulous debtors to engage in strategic defaults without repercussions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations </a>(UN) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50679#.VTvbTiFViko">reported </a>[UN report] that the intense fighting in Yemen has claimed the lives of  approximately 551 civilians, 115 of which were children. Rupert Colville, the spokesperson for the Office of the UN<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx"> High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], noted that this death toll only calculated civilian casualties and that the actual number of lives lost during the fighting is projected to be much higher. He also stated that another 1,185 civilians have been injured. Colville concluded urging all sides contribute to humanitarian aid in the region.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">situation in Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">news archive</a>] has sparked significant international concern. Last week,  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the<a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php"> targeting of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen by combatants </a>[JURIST report]. Also last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">urged Yemeni combatants to report attacks resulting in civilian casualties </a>[JURIST report] so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Earlier this month UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> (UN) [offical website] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] on Friday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50685#.VTvf6CFVikq">expressed concern </a>[UN report] over attacks in Mali in which members of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma/">United Nations Multidimensional Integrated  Stabilization Mission in Mali</a> (MINUSMA) [advocacy website] were specifically targeted, resulting in numerous casualties. So far, the UN has reported that several separate attacks have been orchestrated against peacekeepers in the region. On Thursday seven peacekeepers were injured when one of their vehicles struck an explosive device. The attack on Thursday was preceded by three separate attacks, one on April 15, one on the 17th, and one on the 20th. The Secretary- General noted that such attacks were violative of international law and that those responsible would be brought to justice. He concluded expressing his "profound gratitude" for the peacekeepers serving in the Mail region and the nations who have sent troops to the region as well.</p>

<p>Following the armed rising against the Malian government in early 2012, the nation has experienced significant turmoil relating to the exercise of power by the Malian government and opposing forces. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch </a>(HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/14/mali-lawlessness-abuses-imperil-population">expressed concern</a> [press release, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-urges-mali-to-address-growing-violence-and-abuse.php">report</a>] over the increased violence and human rights abuses committed in Mali. Also earlier this month a UN internal inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-internal-inquiry-finds-use-of-excessive-force-in-mali.php">concluded </a>[JURIST report] that members of MINUSMA used "unauthorized and excessive force" resulting in the deaths of three civilian protesters and the injuries of four other individuals in January. Earlier in April the Taureg-led rebels in Mali <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-mali-talks-idUSKBN0MT29S20150402">met with </a>[Reuters report] Algerian mediators to discuss terms of preliminary peace deals, the same deals they rejected last month. Those rebels are currently in fights with French and U.N. troops in northern Mali, seeking autonomy for the Azawad desert region. In March of last year, UN rights experts<a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-expert-urges-mali-to-strengthen-judicial-system.php"> urged</a> [JURIST report] Mali to strengthen its judicial system due to the difficulty faced in attempting to prosecute war crimes in the nation, and called on MINUSMA to assist. In November 2014 General Amadou Haya Sanogo, the leader of the March 2012 coup, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-mali-junta-detained-for-murder.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of murder, complicity to murder, assassination and kidnapping. In March 2013 Malian Tuareg rebels <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mali-rebels-call-for-icc-investigation.php">called on the ICC </a>[JURIST report] to investigate alleged war crimes committed by Malian government forces during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] (DOS) <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/04/241054.htm">released a statement</a> [text] Thursday condemning the imprisonment of human rights lawyer Intigam Aliyev and calling for his release. Aliyev was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison and a three-year ban from holding public office for on charges of illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and abuse of power. The DOS statement also called the charges "questionable," while Aliyev himself called them "politically motivated." Aliyev is one of the country's most well-known human rights lawyers and head of the <a href="http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/10771.html">Legal Education Society</a> [advocacy website] and worked to defend the rule of law in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>Aliyev's lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/azerbaijan-court-upholds-conviction-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] after his arrest in 2011, saying, "his detention was connected with his activity as human rights defender, and the purpose of this is to silence him down, based on a political instruction from above." Charges have also been brought against other activists in the recent past. Earlier this month Human Rights Watch (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-calls-for-release-of-azerbaijan-human-rights-activist.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of leading human rights activist Rasul Jafarov by a court in Azerbaijan and called for his immediate release. In February the detention of Azeri human rights activist Leyla Yunus, held without trial since July, was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/azerbaijan-court-extends-detention-of-human-rights-activist-without-trial.php">extended an additional five months</a> [JURIST report]. Yunus was reportedly working on the comprehensive list of politically motivated arrests in Azerbaijan with Rasul Jafarov</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indonesia notified nine convicted of drug traffickers--four Nigerian men, two Australian men, a Filipino woman, and one man each from Brazil, France and Indonesia--that their executions will be carried out within 72 hours. The executions will be <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/26/indonesia-gives-72-hours-notice-executions/26406111/">carried out by firing squad</a> [AP report] in Besi prison on Nusakambangan Island at the earliest on Tuesday or Wednesday. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/ban-asks-indonesia-execute-drug-convicts-150425234147138.html">appealed</a> [Al Jazeera report] to Indonesia to stop the planned executions, urging President Joko Widodo to "urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition."</p>

<p>Indonesia has been under international scrutiny over its use of the death penalty. In February a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. In January another spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The OHCHR reported that eight more people convicted of drug trafficking in Vietnam had been sentenced to death. Also in January Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> [JURIST report] their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bahrain Public Prosecution on Sunday extended the period of detention of Bahraini human rights activist <a href="https://twitter.com/NABEELRAJAB">Nabeel Rajab</a> [personal Twitter account; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nabeel+Rajab">news archive</a>] by 15 days, citing a need for further investigation. According to Rajab's wife, the activist was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32167009">arrested </a>[BBC report] on April 2 for tweets he posted about torture practices in Jau prison. At the time of his arrest Rajab was released on bail for charges relating to a September tweet criticizing security institutions in Bahrain, suggesting that they acted as an "ideological incubator" for jihadists. This 15 day extension by the prosecution marks<a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/leading-bahraini-activist-detention-extended-6-months-1192660616"> the second such extension</a> [MEE report] this month, the first of which was made on April 11. A statement from the prosecution said that Rajab stands accused of "spreading tendentious rumors" and "attacking a state institution." The extension was criticized by directory of advocacy for the <a href="http://birdbh.org/">Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy</a> [official website] <a href="https://twitter.com/salwadaei">Sayed Alwadaei</a> [personal Twitter account], who called on the EU and UK to speak out against Rajab's trial and in support of freedom of expression and accused Bahrain of targeting the activist for revealing torture practices rather than those who committed the torture. Both Britain and the United States have demanded that Rajab be released and the case against him be dropped. </p>

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents in recent years. Rajab was <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/bahrain-rights-activist-charged-over-insulting-tweets.php">charged </a>[JURIST report] in October with insulting the ministries of defense and interior over his tweets that alleged Bahrain's security institutions were the first incubators for extremist ideology. A judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/bahrain-court-rejects-request-to-release-activist.php">rejected </a>[JURIST report] a request for conditional early release for Rajab in December 2013. Rajab was initially sentenced to three years in prison, though his sentence was<a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-court-cuts-prison-sentence-for-activist-nabeel-rajab.php"> reduced to one year</a> [JURIST report] after he had already served his sentence. In October 2012<a href="http://www.hrw.org/"> Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Bahrain's court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-center-for-human-rights-urges-king-to-release-their-leader.php">overturn the conviction of Rajab</a> [JURIST report]. That same month the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] for nine medics convicted for their involvement in Bahrain's pro-democracy uprising. According to <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> [official website], at least 95 health workers were arrested in Bahrain only after some medics treated those hurt by security forces and spoke out against the crackdown against protesters, which included firing upon ambulances.  Also in 2012 government officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-pledges-to-follow-un-plan-to-improve-human-rights-conditions.php">pledged to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] the 158 recommendations included in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BHSession13.aspx">UN Universal Periodic Review </a>[materials] regarding human rights abuses against political opposition. HRW called on Bahrain to follow through with their promises, but raised doubts as to whether the government is fully committed to reform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Sunday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/25/egypt-morsy-trial-badly-flawed">said </a>[press release] that the trial of deposed Egyptian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi </a>[BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">news archive</a>] was "badly flawed" and compromised by due process violations. The former president was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-20-years.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] on April 21 for inciting violence and ordering the killing and torturing of protesters in 2012 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. While the full judgment has not yet been made public, a review conducted by HRW of the prosecution's case file summary revealed little evidence to support Morsi's conviction other than testimony from military and police officers and that the case against him was based on his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood. HRW also noted concerns from Morsi's defense team, who said their complaints about limited access to their client were ignored by the court and that the defense team called no witnesses for fear of arrest. One lawyer stated that the glass barrier that surrounded Morsi during the trial also constituted a due process violation, as it made it difficult for him to hear the judge and prevented lawyers from speaking to him. Morsi's defense team plans to appeal the conviction of the former president, who faces five other ongoing prosecutions as well. </p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">ouster of Morsi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Earlier this month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-egypt-mass-trial-relied-on-single-witness-testimony.php">criticized </a>[JURIST report] the mass trial of 51 Muslim Brotherhood supporters, claiming that the government presented no evidence of a crime being committed by the men other than the testimony of a single officer. Also in April an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-prosecutor-refers-187-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-to-military-court.php">referred </a>[JURIST report] 187 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to a military court. The supporters are accused of killing police officers while storming a Maghagha police station in the southern province of Minya in August 2013, only weeks after the removal of Morsi. In late March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted 68 people</a> [JURIST report], including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also in March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced </a>[JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/index.php?page=web.Beranda">Indonesian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Indonesian] has agreed to hear a last minute appeal by two condemned drug smugglers known as the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-04/bali-nine-profiles-andrew-chan-and-myuran-sukumaran/6089120">"Bali Nine Pair"</a> [ABC profile]. The pair's legal representative <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3057399/Indonesias-Constitutional-Court-reportedly-hear-Bali-Nine-appeal-12.html#v-4198358348001">said</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] Monday that the court has agreed to hear the appeal. The pair had been due to face death by firing squad Wednesday after being convicted of trying to smuggle a large amount of cocaine into Australia.Indonesian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15105920">President Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] has denied clemency. It is unclear whether Wednesday's scheduled execution will now be delayed. </p>

<p>Indonesia has been under international scrutiny over its use of the death penalty. Earlier this month an Indonesian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indonesia-court-rejcets-appeal-by-australian-drug-smugglers-on-death-row.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the Bali Nine Pair's appeal. In February a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. In January another spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The OHCHR reported that eight more people convicted of drug trafficking in Vietnam had been sentenced to death. Also in January Brazil and the Netherlands<a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php"> recalled</a> [JURIST report] their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: Cambodia should drop restrictive NGO legislation</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday urged Cambodia to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/26/cambodia-drop-restrictive-organizations-law">drop plans to revive</a> [press release] a restrictive nongovernmental organizations (NGO) law. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13006542">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] has reportedly said he would use the Law on Associations and Nongovernmental Organizations (LANGO) to "handcuff" non compliant groups. Brian Adams, HRW Asia director said that NGOs play a crucial rule in holding the government accountable and that the new law would allow the government to "clamp down on groups that criticize human rights abuses, corruption, and other government misdeeds." The <a href="http://www.cpp.org.kh">Cambodian Peoples Party</a> (CPP) [party website] has suggested bills like this several times in the past 20 years. While drafts of the proposed legislation have improved, HRW says that the vague text will potentially allow the government to remove disfavored groups at their discretion. HRW also claims that the draft legislation contains burdensome reporting requirements for groups and barriers for international groups. HRW has urged the government to make the draft available for public debate and drop current drafts until then.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature has led to international concern. Earlier this month the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="http://t.co/MLGiUA6TX0">stated</a> [report, DOC] that the government needs to make public all draft legislation in order to facilitate debate. Cambodia has had a history of human rights abuses that have continued to alarm rights organizations around the world. In early March <a href="http://en.nac-kh.org/httpdocs/naweb/english/group-article/51">Cambodia's Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/cambodia-passes-controversial-new-election-laws.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] two controversial new election laws that rights groups criticized as ill-conceived and potentially damaging to free speech. In January Cambodian General Sao Sohka admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodian-commander-admits-to-using-force-against-political-opposition.php">using force</a> [JURIST report] against political opponents of the CPP. Earlier in January the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-restarts-genocide-hearings.php">restarted genocide hearings</a> [JURIST report] against the former Khmer Rouge regime's surviving leaders. Proceedings had been postponed since November, when defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trial-postponed-to-january.php">refused to participate</a> [JURIST report] because they were still working to appeal an earlier verdict. In October the Cambodian government <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/cambodia-children-facing-violence-report.php">released the findings of a survey</a> [JURIST report] showing the magnitude of violence against children throughout the country. In September UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia Surya Subedi <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-rights-expert-commends-cambodia-progress.php">commented</a> [JURIST report] on Cambodia's recent efforts in human rights protection, noting that while there have been improvements, there are still substantial problems in the judicial system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042715zor_9o6b.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in two cases on Monday. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/spokeo-inc-v-robins/">Spokeo v. Robins</a> [docket], the court is <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/13-1339-Spokeo-v-Robins-Cert-Petition-for-filing.pdf">asked</a> [cert petition, PDF] to determine whether Congress may confer Article III standing upon a plaintiff who suffers no concrete harm and who therefore could not otherwise invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, by authorizing a private right of action based on a bare violation of a federal statute. Plaintiff Thomas Robins seeks statutory damages under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-41/subchapter-III">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA) [text] for a technical violation of the statute that did not cause him any harm. Robins alleges that defendant <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo, Inc.</a> [corporate website], a persons search website, published false information about him. Under the Act, an individual may seek recovery for a bare violation. The case thus raises the constitutional issue of whether the Act confers standing on a plaintiff who alleges a violation of a federal statute but who does not allege any resulting injury.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/green-v-donahoe/">Green v. Donahoe</a> [docket], the court is <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Green-v-USPS-w-Appendix-FINAL.pdf">asked</a> [cert petition, PDF] to determine whether, under federal employment discrimination law, the filing period for a constructive discharge claim begins to run when an employee resigns, as five circuits have held, or at the time of an employer's last allegedly discriminatory act giving rise to the resignation, as three other circuits have held. The case was brought after the plaintiff, a former postmaster for the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">US Postal Service</a> [official website], was turned down in 2008 for a promotion in favor of a Latino man. He filed a charge with the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] alleging race discrimination under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1311">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text], and the matter was eventually settled. Green alleges that he experienced what he perceived to be threats and harassment about his EEO filing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-27-15.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] on Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/04/argument-preview-pre-trial-detainees-and-excessive-force-in-jail/">Kingsley v. Hendrickson</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] over whether excessive-force claims brought by pre-trial detainees should be governed by the standard applicable to free people on the street, or instead by a standard like the one applicable to convicted criminals in prison. In the case, plaintiff Michael Kingsley <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-6368_5426.pdf">argues</a> [transcript, PDF] that his excessive force claim should governed by an objective <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_iv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] inquiry focusing on "unreasonable" searches and seizures, as are typical excessive force claims. In cases of convicted persons, people are generally treated as lawfully "seized," rendering the Fourth Amendment largely inapplicable. At the time of the alleged incidents, Kingsley was in detention awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Allegations regarding the use of excessive force in the US have led the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">Committee Against Torture</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-committee-urges-us-to-investigate-police-brutality-and-limit-use-of-tasers---dnp.php">urge the US</a> [JURIST report] to begin prompt, impartial investigations into all cases of police brutality and excessive use of force by police officers, and to limit the use of electrical discharge weapons. Last year advocacy organizations such as <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy websites] issued reports alleging the use of police force and intimidation tactics to dispel largely nonviolent protesters <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/rights-groups-allege-constitutional-freedoms-threatened-in-wake-of-missouri-shooting.php">threatens constitutional freedoms</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] USA Executive Director Steven Hawkins on Tuesday <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-usa-baltimore-police-must-exercise-restraint-during-protests">urged Baltimore police</a> [press release] to exercise restraint during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force. The statement comes amid protests over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Hawkins also addressed the right to protest and peacefully assembly, emphasizing that it should not inhibited by intimidation and excessive force. The statement continues:<blockquote>Officers have the right to defend themselves and a duty to protect the safety of the public, but when confronting violence they must work in accordance with international standards governing the use of force. Large-scale use of tactics like tear gas and smoke bombs should not be used to quell acts of violence by a minority when the majority of protesters are non-violent. Such tactics will only lead to an escalation that places everyone at greater risk.</blockquote>Maryland does not have a state law governing the use of force. On Monday Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency as protests escalated, and National Guard troops have been deployed.</p>

<p>Racial tension has recently mounted in the US following several police killings of unarmed black men. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who last year <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">shot and killed Micheal Brown</a> [<em>USA Today</em> Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case even reached international news with AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN independent board of inquiry announced Monday that it uncovered evidence that at least 44 Palestinians were killed by "Israeli actions" while sheltering at UN locations during last year's Gaza war. The investigation also <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/un-israeli-actions-killed-44-palestinians-un-shelters-162503602.html">found</a> [AP report] that at least 227 Palestinians were injured. In response to the findings, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50705#.VT-Z6JTF8ww">stated</a> [UN News Centre report]:<blockquote>The agony of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and the tragic, decades-long predicament they endure there, is reflected in the report of the Board of Inquiry. We should also bear in mind that Israeli civilians in southern Israel continue to face the threat of rocket and terrorist attacks by Hamas and other militant groups.</blockquote>Ban also stressed the need for resumption of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and called for international support.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/israel-palestine">Israel-Palestine conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] continues to be a significant international legal issue. Last month the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-annual-humanitarian-overview-for-the-situation-in-palestine-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its 2014 Annual Humanitarian Overview, noting that Palestinian civilians continue to face daily threats to their physical safety and liberty, with 2014 holding the highest civilian death toll in the conflict since the annexation of the Palestinian territories in 1967. Also last month the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights told the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] that human rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-condemns-violations-in-gaza-conflic.php">violations "fuel and shape the conflict"</a> [JURIST report] in the occupied Palestinian territories. In November the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-body-urges-israel-to-investigate-alleged-war-crimes.php">urged Israel to investigate</a> [JURIST report] alleged violations committed by its forces during the recent conflict in Gaza. The 2014 conflict lasted from July 8 to August 26, resulting in more than 100,000 buildings damaged and nearly 2,200 deaths, with a high quantity of civilian casualties. Last year <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] accused the Israeli military of <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes-in-gaza.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report] by attacking schools where hundreds of displaced Palestinians sought shelter. Earlier that month the <a href="http://israellawcenter.org/">Israel Law Center</a> [advocacy website] asked the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">open an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged war crimes committed by Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-28-15.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] Tuesday on <a href="/feature/featured/the-states-and-same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The court heard two-and-half hours of oral arguments in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], which was consolidated with three other cases. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2014/14-556-q1">first question</a> [argument audio; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q1_7l48.pdf">transcript</a>, PDF] before the court was "Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?" The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2014/14-556-q2">second question</a> [argument audio; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q2_2dp3.pdf">transcript</a>, PDF] was "Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?" Questions from the justices touched on topics ranging from the historic definition of marriage to equal protection. It is unclear how the justices will rule, but many legal experts predict that the court will split along liberal and conservative lines with Justice Anthony Kennedy as the swing vote. A ruling is expected by the end of June.</p>

<p>Earlier this month a group of 15 US states, led by Louisiana, <a href="/paperchase/Louisianaamicusbrief.pdf">urged</a> [amicus brief, PDF] the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/15-states-urge-us-supreme-court-to-uphold-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">uphold same-sex marriage bans</a> [JURIST report]. The brief asserted that voters should decide for themselves whether to allow same-sex marriages in their respective states. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in January to rule on same-sex marriage. The court consolidated appeals from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee after the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/sixth-circuit-upholds-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">upheld bans</a> [JURIST report] in those states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight convicted drug smugglers were executed in Indonesia early Wednesday despite international criticism and pleas for clemency. Among those <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/04/29/ri-executes-8-drug-convicts.html">executed by firing squad</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report] were Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, part of the so-called "Bali Nine," who were arrested in 2005 for recruiting seven others to smuggle heroin from Indonesia into Australia. Also executed Wednesday were Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, Nigerians Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Raheem Agbaje Salami and Okwudili Oyatanze, and Ghanaian Martin Anderson. Filipina prisoner Mary Jane Veloso was originally scheduled for execution Wednesday but was spared after an individual who allegedly recruited her to smuggle drugs turned herself over to authorities. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/04/indonesia-reprehensible-executions-show-complete-disregard-for-human-rights-safeguards/">condemned the executions</a> [press release] as "reprehensible," saying they show "complete disregard for due process and human rights safeguards."</p>

<p>Indonesian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15105920">President Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] has remained firm in his stance that drug smugglers must face harsh penalties despite international criticism. In February a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. In January another spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The OHCHR reported that eight more people convicted of drug trafficking in Vietnam had been sentenced to death. Also in January Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> [JURIST report] their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Dutch appellate court ruled Wednesday that Gen. Thom Karremans, who ordered Bosnian Muslims away from a UN peacekeeping compound during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Srebrenica+">news archive</a>], will not be prosecuted. Karremans, along with two other soldiers, faced charges for forcing three Bosnian Muslim men to leave the UN compound during the massacre, which ultimately led to their death. At this time, Bosnian Serb forces had overtaken the town and were busy leading approximately 8,000 Muslim men and boys to remote sites for execution and mass burial. Family members of the victims argued that their Muslim relatives should have been offered protection. However, the court found that Karremans could not be held criminally liable, as he was not obligated to realize the Bosnian Muslims had a chance of execution if turned away from the UN peacekeeper compound.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced. Investigations of war crimes relating to the Bosnian-Serbian conflict are ongoing, and suspects are still being arrested and prosecuted. Earlier this month the ICTY upheld the majority of <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icty-upholds-life-sentence-for-bosnian-serb-army-general.php">convictions</a> [JURIST report] for Bosnian Serb army General Zdravko Tolimir for his involvement in the massacre. At the end of January the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/icty-upholds-bosnian-serb-genocide-convictions.php">upheld genocide convictions</a> [JURIST report] for Vujadin Popovic and Ljubisa Beara for crimes perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces during the 1995 massacre. Also in January the war crimes division of the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-politician-for-genocide.php">confirmed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] of Dragomir Vasic on charges of genocide. In October the <a href="http://www.defensie.nl/english">Netherlands Ministry of Defense</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/netherlands-plans-to-appeal-finding-of-liability-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] to appeal a ruling finding Netherlands liable for the deaths of 300 of the men and boys killed in the Srebrenica massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-04/cp150046en.pdf">restricted</a> [press release, PDF] bans on blood donations from homosexual men. Since 1983, France automatically and permanently banned blood donations from all men who had ever had sex with another man, calling it a measure of safety against spreading the HIV virus. This ban was seen by many critics as a discriminatory action based on sexual orientation. A French man, Geoffrey Léger, filed a lawsuit over the ban in 2009 after he was turned away from a blood bank for admitting to prior sexual relations with another man. The ECJ then examined the case, determining that the ban may be permitted if it was in the best interest to protect the health of others. However, the ECJ limited the ban to apply only under strict conditions. Rather than instilling a blanket ban over the blood donations of all homosexual men, the ECJ stated that acceptance of donations should be determined on an individual basis. The court suggested that questionnaires and individual interviews with donors should be instituted in effort to weed out those with "high-risk sexual behaviour." Additionally, the ECJ called upon health professionals to determine if there are techniques to effectively detect HIV in the blood, for the health benefit of all donation recipients. </p>

<p>Bans on blood donations from homosexual individuals garner much debate. In 2013 a Northern Ireland judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/ireland-ban-on-homosexual-blood-donation-ruled-irrational.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Health Minister Edwin Poots could not continue to enforce the lifetime ban on gay men donating blood, calling the law "irrational." The UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health">Department of Health</a> [official website] announced in September 2011 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-lifts-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-men.php">lift the lifetime ban</a> [JURIST report] on blood donations from men who have had sex with other men. An <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.ca/">Ontario Superior Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="/paperchase/Freeman%20Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] in September 2010 that the <a href="https://www.blood.ca/">Canadian Blood Services</a> (CBS) is <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-upholds-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.php">justified in prohibiting sexually active gay males from donating blood</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that the CBS discriminates on the basis of health and safety considerations rather than on sexual orientation. In March 2009 a Tasmanian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/australia-court-rules-red-cross-not.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.redcross.org.au/default.asp">Australian Red Cross</a> [organization website] <a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/faq">policy</a> [text] to refuse blood donations from sexually active homosexual males. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Giza Criminal Court on Wednesday sentenced 69 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] supporter to 25 years in prison for attacking and burning a church in a village near Cairo in 2013 during protests against former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive]. In addition, Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/29/us-egypt-court-idUSKBN0NK1FR20150429">sentenced</a> [Reuters report] two other juvenile defendants to 10 years in prison without the opportunity for parole. The defendants were charged with torching religious facility, possessing weapons and unlicensed ammunition, attempted killing, blocking of roads, resisting authorities and joining the banned political party. The sentences may be appealed.</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the ouster of Morsi in 2013, and political backlash has been particularly strong against his Muslim Brotherhood party. Earlier this month an Egyptian Criminal Court in Giza <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-supporters-to-death.php">sentenced 22 people to death</a> [JURIST report] for their involvement in the storming of a police station and killing of an officer on the day Morsi was overthrown. Also this month an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-prosecutor-refers-187-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-to-military-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] 187 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to a military court. The supporters are accused of killing police officers while storming a Maghagha police station in the southern province of Minya in August 2013, only weeks after the removal of Morsi. In late March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-free-68-activists.php">acquitted 68 people</a> [JURIST report], including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were charged with gathering illegally and attacking security forces earlier this year. Also last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 13 others to death after finding them guilty of planning attacks against the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1499_d18e.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 Wednesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/williams-yulee-v-the-florida-bar/">Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that states may ban judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign donations. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that such restrictions do not violate the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text]. Roberts wrote:<blockquote>Judges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot. And a State's decision to elect its judiciary does not compel it to treat judicial candidates like campaigners for political office. A State may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favor&#8212;and without having personally asked anyone for money.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito also filed dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Judicial candidate Lanell Williams-Yulee conducted a mass mailing seeking contributions for her judicial campaign. In response, she was charged by the Florida bar for violating a rule of judicial professional conduct that prohibits candidates for judicial office from personally soliciting campaign funds. She was ultimately publicly reprimanded and forced to pay the costs of her disciplinary proceeding. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-florida-judicial-campaign-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in January after <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in October.. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1019_c1o2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that courts have authority to review whether the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] has fulfilled its duty under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1311">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text] to attempt conciliation. Additionally, the court ruled that the appropriate scope of judicial review of the EEOC's conciliation activities is narrow, enforcing only the EEOC's statutory obligation to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve voluntary compliance. By limiting such review, EEOC discretion is protected while still ensuring that it follows the law. The case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mach-mining-v-equal-employment-opportunity-commission/">Mach Mining, LLC v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], was brought after a woman filed a charge with the EEOC claiming that petitioner Mach Mining, LLC, had refused to hire her as a coal miner because of her sex. After finding reasonable cause to believe that Mach Mining had discriminated against the complainant, the EEOC then sued the company in federal district court alleging sex discrimination in hiring.</p>

<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 directs the EEOC to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-5">try to negotiate</a> [42 USC § 2000e-5(b)] an end to an employer's unlawful employment practices before suing for a judicial remedy. Mach Mining sought dismissal of the EEOC's suit on the ground that the agency failed to engage in good-faith conciliation before filing. Last year the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/EEOC_v_Mach_Mining_LLC_738_F3d_171_121_FEP_Cases_327_7th_Cir_2013">ruled</a> [opinion] that "an alleged failure to conciliate is not an affirmative defense to the merits of a discrimination suit." The Supreme Court was asked to resolve the split among the circuits, calling on the court to interpret anti-discrimination statutory provisions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-29-15.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in two cases Wednesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-7955_1b72.pdf">Glossip v. Gross</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional under the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_viii">Eighth Amendment</a> [text]. The case originated when four death row inmates <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.newsok.com/documents/Warner%20Complaint.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] against the director of the <a href="http://www.ok.gov/doc/">Oklahoma Department of Corrections</a> [official website] for the use of the midazolam drug in the state's lethal injection protocol, alleging that the drug can cause a substantial risk of "severe pain, needless suffering, and a lingering death." The inmates also alleged that a negligent administering of the drug can cause one to be conscious for the remainder of the lethal injection process, as evidenced by Oklahoma's <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">botched execution of former inmate Clayton Lockett</a> [JURIST report]. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-185_d1o2.pdf">Mata v. Lynch</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether a federal appeals court has jurisdiction over denials by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) of requests to equitably toll motions to reopen. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5th-Cir-Mata.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that it had no jurisdiction to review petitioner's request that the BIA equitably toll the 90-day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1003.2">8 CFR § 1003.2(c)(2)</a> [text]. Wednesday's arguments mark the last of the current term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Pakistan anti-terrorism court in the Swat region sentenced 10 men to life in prison on Thursday for their involvement in the 2012 attack on education activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23241937">Malala Yousafzai</a> [BBC profile]. Yousafzai, then 15, was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/ten-men-jailed-pakistan-malala-attack-150430101505917.html">shot in the head</a> [Al Jazeera report] on her school bus on her way home from school, and the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/breaking-down-tehreek-e-taliban-2013112121349713830.html">Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan</a> (TTP) [Al Jazeera backgrounder] had claimed responsibility for the act. None of her original assailants was among the 10 sentenced Thursday, but the men on trial allegedly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/malala-yousafzai-pakistan-court-jailed-attack-terrorism">assisted in planning</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the assassination attempt. The exact charges against the men are unclear, as the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32530324">trial was closed</a> [BBC report] to media and the public. Several of the actual gunmen are believed to have fled across the border into Afghanistan, and Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah is wanted in connection with the crime. A life imprisonment sentence in Pakistan lasts for a period of 25 years. These were the first convictions related to the 2012 attack.</p>

<p>Yousafzai, now 17, was targeted for rallying against the Taliban's efforts to keep young girls from receiving an education and against militants operating in the Pashtun area of Pakistan. Two other girls were injured in the shooting, but Yousafzai's injuries were the most critical. After the attack she received treatment in the UK and remains there today. She and her family cannot return to Pakistan due to many Taliban death threats. Yousafzai was awarded the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2014/press.html">2014 Nobel Peace Prize</a> [press release] for her campaign for children's rights. She runs an international organization called the <a href="http://www.malala.org/">Malala Fund</a> [advocacy website] to advocate for all girls to have the right to receive an education around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] North Korean leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile] has ordered the execution of 15 officials this year, the <a href="http://eng.nis.go.kr/svc/index.do">South Korean National Intelligence Service</a> [official website] told a closed parliamentary meeting on Wednesday. These officials were allegedly <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32511431">executed by firing squad</a> [BBC report] for spying. Four members of the Unhaso Orchestra are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/29/world/north-korea-executions/">believed to be among the 15 executed</a> [CNN report]. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/29/kim-jong-un-executes-15-top-officials-south-korean-spies">Two vice-ministers were also killed</a> [Guardian report], allegedly for disagreeing with or complaining about their orders from Kim. North Korea has not confirmed these executions, but Kim has been known to "purge" his opponents before. In 2013 he put his uncle, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25197601">Chang Song-thaek</a> [BBC profile], to death along with several officials close to him.</p>

<p>In November UN Special Rapporteur on the situation in the People's Republic of Korea Marzuki Darusman said that there is enough evidence to hold North Korean leader Kim responsible for <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-expert-enough-evidence-to-hold-north-korea-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">"massive" human rights atrocities</a> [JURIST report] committed in the country. Also in November the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-general-assembly-north-korea-should-be-referred-to-icc.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Security Council to call on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] to investigate the crimes. The UN has sought to investigate and counter alleged human rights abuses in North Korea in the past. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-body-calls-for-justice-in-north-korea.php#.U1EvqFcS-Ca">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] last March urging the UN Security Council to take action against those responsible for documented crimes against humanity in North Korea. Last February then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that there <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-urges-action-in-north-korea.php#.U1Ev_FcS-CY">can no longer be any excuses for inaction</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea following the release of a UN report. In September 2013 the UN Human Rights Commission reported <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-commission-finds-serious-violations-in-north-korea.php#.U1EwF1cS-CY">widespread human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] occurring in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] North Carolina lawmakers on Wednesday approved a measure aimed at resuming executions after nine years. The law removes the requirement to have a doctor present at all lethal injections and instead would allow nurses, physician's assistants or paramedics to oversee lethal injections in the state. North Carolina's <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/house/house.html">House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed the legislation in an 84-33 vote. The measure still must pass the Senate. Currently there are 149 inmates on death row in North Carolina. The state has not executed any inmates since 2006, partially due to conflicts with policy changes of the <a href="http://www.ncmedboard.org/">North Carolina Medical Board</a> [official website]. The Medical Board believes physician participation in capital punishment is a departure from the ethics of the medical profession [NCMB <a href="http://www.ncmedboard.org/position_statements/detail/capital_punishment">position statement</a>]. However, in September 2007 a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/north-carolina-medical-board-cant.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the North Carolina Medical Board does not have authority to discipline doctors that participate in state death penalty procedures.  </p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST news archive] and execution methods have been at the forefront of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Earlier this week the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-oklahoma-lethal-injection-procedure.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam. Also in April the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty, but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A South African judge ruled Thursday that a terminally ill man has a right to assisted suicide with no legal or professional consequences for the participating doctor. Euthanasia is illegal in South Africa, and the decision is the first of its kind. With the support of <a href="http://www.dignitysa.org/">DignitySA</a> [advocacy website], Robin Stransham-Ford, a 65-year-old man with prostate cancer, filed a motion with the court asking that he be allowed to choose the time and location of his death with assistance form a licensed medical practitioner. The order clarifies that it "shall not be read as endorsing the proposals of the draft Bill on End of Life as contained in the Law and Commission Report of November 1998 (Project 86) as laying down the necessary or only conditions for the entitlement to the assistance of a qualified medical doctor to commit suicide." The proposed assisted suicide legislation has languished since 1998 when it was submitted to the justice and health departments. The Justice Department plans to appeal Thursday's decision.</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue in the US and around the world. In February the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/canadian-supreme-court-authorizes-medically-assisted-suicide.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the country's ban on medically assisted suicide. Also that month a group of patients and doctors filed a lawsuit in a New York court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/new-york-doctors-patients-file-assisted-suicide-lawsuit.php">requesting a declaration</a> [JURIST report] that physician-assisted suicide is not illegal under New York state law.  In January California lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/california-lawmakers-propose-assisted-suicide-bill.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0101-0150/sb_128_bill_20150120_introduced.pdf">bill</a> [SB 128, PDF] to permit patients who meet specific criteria the right to medically end their lives. In 2006 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], making Oregon the only US state that allowed assisted suicide at that time. Vermont, Washington, New Mexico and Montana now also allow assisted suicide. Possibly the most contentious right to die case ended in 2005, when <a href="/forum/2005/12/living-and-dying-in-post-schiavo-world.php">Terri Schiavo</a> [JURIST op-ed] passed away following a heated legal battle between family members on whether to artificially maintain her life in a vegetative state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en">UN Women</a> [official website] on Monday released <a href="http://progress.unwomen.org/en/2015/">Progress of the World's Women 2015-2016: Transforming Economies, Realizing Rights</a> [text], the gender-equality organization's flagship report on the status of women around the world. The report "proposes a comprehensive agenda for key policy actors, including gender equality advocates, national governments and international agencies, to make human rights a lived reality for all women and girls," by focusing on the economic and social aspects of gender relations "including the right of all women to a good job, with fair pay and safe working conditions, to an adequate pension in older age, to health care and to safe water, without discrimination based on factors such as socioeconomic status, geographic location and race or ethnicity." The report was <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/4/press-release-new-report-from-un-women-unveils-far-reaching-alternative-policy-agenda">launched</a> [press release] to coincide with the 20-year anniversary of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/">Fourth World Conference on Women</a> [UN report], a program that set an agenda leading to substantial gains in women's rights, especially at the political level. Despite these gains, the new report details significant work to be done, as only half of women around the world are a part of the workforce, compared to around three quarters of men, and earn around 24 percent less globally. </p>

<p>Despite international efforts to <a href="/dateline/2015/01/anjelica-violi-educating-men.php">educate communities</a> [JURIST op-ed] and protect women's rights to be free from discrimination, women worldwide still face inequality due frequently to a lack of governmental support. Last month the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-afghanistan-should-strengthen-justice-system-to-protect-women.php">urged the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] to provide women protection against domestic violence within the state. Also last month Amnesty International reported that Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram has <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-boko-haram-has-arrested-at-least-2000-women-since-2014.php">abducted at least 2,000 women and girls</a> [JURIST report] since the start of 2014, subjecting some to forced-marriage. On the first of April the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-urge-tanzania-to-prevent-discrimination-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Tanzania to enforce its international obligations to prevent discrimination against women, after two women brought suit arguing that customary laws enforced in their communities contravened Tanzania's constitution and its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. In February the UN reported that in at least 70 countries, women and girls have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">attacked for seeking education</a> [JURIST report], which is seen as a challenge to existing gender-based systems of oppression. In January, Amnesty International detailed the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-egypt-failing-to-protect-women-from-violence.php">significant challenges Egyptian women face daily</a> [JURIST report], including violence in all aspects of life. The group implored the Egyptian government to recognize the wide scale of the problem and enforce the new laws that were put in place to prevent the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/04/30/13-55011.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a Santa Monica, California, <a href="http://www.qcode.us/codes/santamonica/">city ordinance</a> [municipal code] prohibiting unattended exhibits in Palisades Park, deciding against the <a href="http://www.santamonicanativityscenes.org/">Santa Monica Nativity Scenes Committee</a> [advocacy website]. The committee had been granted a "winter display" exception from the city's 1994 law banning all unattended displays, but amidst religious controversy that exception was revoked in 2012. In dismissing the committee's complaint that the ordinance violated their <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text] rights, the court stated, "[t]he repeal [of the exception] was a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation," and was therefore not a violation of the group's right to free speech. The court went on to state:<blockquote>The fact that the speakers who succeeded in crowding the nativity scenes out of Palisades Park were atheists who explicitly opposed the scenes' display is surely a bitter pill for the Committee. ... [However], by repealing its Winter Display exception, the City did no more than treat all potential displays equally. If the [plaintiffs] feel that the burden of the regulation falls most heavily on them, it is perhaps because they are now held to the same standard as all other similarly situated applicants. While the adjustment may not be an easy one, the outcome is inescapably content-neutral.</blockquote>The committee stated that it will not appeal the decision further, but will instead erect the scene on private property elsewhere in the city. </p>

<p>Religious displays on public property remain controversial under the First Amendment. In August a judge for the US District Court for the District of New Mexico ruled that a New Mexico city must <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-rules-new-mexico-city-hall-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">remove a Ten Commandments monument</a> [JURIST report] placed outside of Bloomfield city hall. Last May the US Supreme Court ruled that the practice of <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-rules-prayer-allowed-at-town-meetings.php">opening town meetings with a prayer</a> [JURIST report] does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment [text]. In 2011 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-utah-highway-crosses.php">declined to rule</a> on whether crosses placed beside highways as memorials to deceased Utah Highway Patrol troopers is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion, allowing the August 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which found found the display unconstitutional, to stand. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French aviation giant <a href="http://www.airbus.com/">Airbus</a> [corporate website] said Friday it is filing criminal complaints alleging that German intelligence helped the US carry out industrial espionage. The criminal complaint against persons unknown was filed following German media reports that the country's spy agency <a href="http://www.bnd.bund.de/EN/_Home/home_node.html">BND</a> [official website] was collecting data on European firms at the request of the US <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> [official website]. Allegations claim that the German government knew about the NSA spying on European businesses since 2008. According to the reports, the agency did not target German or US officials in the surveillance because they are protected by a 2002 BND-NSA agreement. Airbus has asked the German government for more information, which is under pressure to disclose how much it knew about the operations.</p>

<p>The NSA has been under intense scrutiny and caused international tensions ever since Snowden <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">leaked</a> [JURIST report] top-secret NSA documents in 2013. In February a US District Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-warrantless-surveillance.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to NSA warrantless surveillance. The same month the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of citizens' Internet use violates human rights law.  In July the German government <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/germany-summons-us-amabassdor-in-surveillance-investigation.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] US ambassador <a href="http://germany.usembassy.gov/about/ambassador/">John Emerson</a> [official website] after the arrest of a man who was claimed to be a US spy working surveillance throughout the country. In June 2013 the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court just days after Snowden claimed responsibility for the leaks. As the outcry over the revelations began to expand in scope and severity, several other human rights groups decided to sue as well. The following month both the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed suit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-surveillance.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] similar claims on the behalf of a coalition of 19 separate organizations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The State&#8217;s Attorney for Baltimore City on Friday <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/media-center/press-releases/708-marilyn-mosby-charges-six-baltimore-police-officers-involved-in-the-freddie-gray-arrest">charged six police officers</a> [press release] with crimes including murder and manslaughter over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Baltimore state attorney <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/office/meet-marilyn-mosby">Marilyn Mosby</a> [official profile] filed charges almost immediately upon receiving the medical examiner's report that ruled Gray's death a homicide. Gray's arrest and death have led to ongoing protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">urged Baltimore police to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force. Also on Friday, amidst national concern about police behavior, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] announced a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-20-million-funding-support-body-worn-camera-pilot-program">$20 million body camera grant</a> [press release] program that includes training, technical assistance and evaluation to accompany $17 million for local law enforcement agencies to purchase body-worn cameras. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, "Body-worn cameras hold tremendous promise for enhancing transparency, promoting accountability, and advancing public safety for law enforcement officers and the communities they serve."</p>

<p>Racial tension has recently mounted in the US following several police killings of unarmed black men. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who last year <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">shot and killed Micheal Brown</a> [USA Today Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Governor Peter Shumlin</a> [official website] on Friday signed into law a bill that creates new restrictions on who may own guns in the state of Vermont. Under the new law, which will go into effect July 1, people with certain criminal convictions will be prohibited from possessing a gun. Those who violate this restriction will be <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2015/05/02/vermont-governor-authorizes-gun-control-law/">subject to state prosecution</a> [AP report]. The law also calls for state courts to report findings of mental illness to a federal registry. Those deemed unfit for gun ownership and added to the registry would have their rights restored once recovered from mental illness. While an earlier version of the bill would have expanded requirements for background checks for private gun sales, this provision was eliminated from the final draft. The governor previously said that he did not see a need for new state gun restrictions but stated Friday that the new bill made common sense changes that met his approval, which drove him to sign it. He said in an <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/node/2337">official statement</a> [statement] that Vermonters knew that he felt that Vermont's gun laws made sense for the state and that they in Vermont "have a culture of using guns to care for and manage [their] natural resources in a respectful way that has served [them] well." </p>

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December 2012. Last December the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-gun-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting individuals who have been committed to a mental institution for any amount of time from possessing a firearm is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. This court was the first to strike down a federal gun law under the Second Amendment since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] effectively <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_290">struck down</a> [opinion] Washington, DC's ban on firearm ownership six years ago. However, mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut and elsewhere have spurred some state legislatures to create and adopt gun control laws. In August a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of Maryland</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-upholds-critical-provisions-of-maryland-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] portions of Maryland's gun control law, which banned certain types of "assault weapons" and a limited gun magazines to 10 rounds, explaining that the law served a legitimate government interest of ensuring public safety. In June a judge for the <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/federal-judge-upholds-colorado-gun-control-laws.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] two Colorado statutes that expanded mandatory background checks and banned high capacity magazines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior official at the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15915&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] Friday that the trial and conviction of former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed was "vastly unfair, arbitrary, and disproportionate" and urged action to resolve the deepening political crisis. Mona Rishmawi, head of the OHCHR's rule of law, equality and non-discrimination branch, said Nasheed's 19-day trial was "politically motivated and his conviction was reached by judges wielding incredible discretionary powers." The UN human rights office urged the government to create an environment conducive for political dialogue and ensure Nasheed's safety in custody.</p>

<p>The Maldives judiciary has generated significant controversy over the last two years. In March the <a href="http://criminalcourt.gov.mv/">Criminal Court of Maldives</a> [official website] sentenced Nasheed to 13 years in prison for terrorism-related charges. The charges relate to <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/maldives-ex-president-arrested-on-terrorism-charges.php">actions</a> [JURIST report] taken three years ago by the former president, which included the arrest and detainment of a top judge. In October the OHCHR expressed <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-office-condemns-maldives-prosecution-of-human-rights-commission-members.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] over the Supreme Court's prosecution of five members of the <a href="http://www.hrcm.org.mv/Homepage.aspx">Maldives Human Rights Commission</a> [official website]. Last March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/maldives-supreme-court-sentences-election-commission.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the country's four top election commissioners, giving each a six-month jail sentence and three-year suspension for "disobeying orders." In November 2013 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/maldives-high-court-delays-presidential-election-for-third-time.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the nation's presidential election for the third time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A new Washington, DC, law that prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their reproductive decisions will take effect on Saturday despite a Thursday House vote to strike down the law. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/house-votes-to-strike-down-dc-reproductive-rights-law/2015/05/01/b6bdf08e-f008-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html">late vote</a> [WP report] by the divided US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] this week marks the first time in almost 25 years the House has voted on whether to upend a District law and the first time in almost 35 years that such a vote was based on ideological grounds. The fight against the District law was led by House Republicans and started by Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz before he began his presidential campaign, but ultimately ended in defeat as the bill remains on track to become law. While conservatives have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/dc-reproductive-health-_n_7185902.html">argued</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] that the law would violate the religious liberty of religious employers who could be forced to hire applicants with beliefs that conflicted with theirs or cover contraception and abortion, Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Cecile Richards stated that approving a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d114:h.j.res.00043:">measure to overturn the law</a> [materials] would allow bosses to fire women for taking birth control and would give employers the right to discriminate against LGBT people, women and others. Earlier on Thursday <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] threatened to veto the measure to overturn the bill if passed, saying that it would have "the unacceptable effect of undermining the will of District of Columbia citizens." </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have remained a divisive issue throughout the country. In April Kansas Governor Sam Brownback <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/kansas-governor-signs-bill-banning-second-trimester-abortion-procedure.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother, making Kansas the first state to ban this type of procedure. Earlier that month the Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/wisconsin-ag-appeals-abortion-ruling.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. At the end of March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Friday called on the Thai government to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/01/thailand-mass-graves-rohingya-found-trafficking-camp">authorize a UN-assisted inquiry into human trafficking</a> [press release] in Thailand. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/02/us-thailand-myanmar-rohingya-idUSKBN0NN0C520150502">discovery of more than 20 bodies of ethnic Rohingya Muslims</a> [Reuters report] near an abandoned trafficking camp inspired the call. Rohingya migrants fleeing persecution from Myanmar and Bangladesh are often victimized by human trafficking networks, many of which are allegedly protected or supported by government officials. HRW has previously reported that <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/27/thailand-traffickers-access-government-run-shelter">human traffickers are allowed access to government-run shelters</a> [HRW report] and on abuses suffered in those government-run shelters. However, Thai authorities do not permit the office of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] to conduct refugee status determination screening of these Rohingya, which leaves room for many migrants to fall victim to traffickers.</p>

<p>Approximately <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/36-million-living-in-modern-slavery-report.php">36 million people in the world live in a form of modern slavery</a> [JURIST report], the <a href="http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/">Global Slavery Index</a> (GSI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://d3mj66ag90b5fy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Global_Slavery_Index_2014_final_lowres.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] in November. For the purposes of the study, GSI defined modern slavery as involving "one person possessing or controlling another person in such as a way as to significantly deprive that person of their individual liberty, with the intention of exploiting that person through their use, management, profit, transfer or disposal." <a href="/forum/2015/03/tseliso-thipanyane-trafficking-africa.php">Human trafficking</a> [JURIST op-ed] plays a prominent role in supplying the labor in modern slavery. In March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-modern-slavery.php">called for an end to modern slavery and human trafficking</a> [JURIST report] during remarks at the unveiling of The Ark of Return, Memorial to the Victims of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Earlier that month, UN human rights expert Maria Grazia Giammarinaro urged the Malaysian government to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-urges-malaysia-to-improve-efforts-against-human-trafficking.php">make improvements to its efforts to combat human trafficking</a> [JURIST report]. In August, Kenya's parliament passed a law <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/kenya-passes-law-to-protect-against-human-trafficking.php">providing greater support to victims of human trafficking</a> [JURIST report]; the law will also make it easier to secure convictions for perpetrators.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) expressed <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15915&LangID=E">concern</a> [press release] Friday over actions by <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html">Burundi</a> [CIA backgrounder] authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections. OHCHR Spokesman Rupert Colville <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50751#.VUYzpo5Viko">noted in particular</a> [UN News Centre report] the detention of hundreds of people in overcrowded prisons, the use of live ammunition by Burundi security forces during protests, and restricting the free exchange of information by shutting down Radio Publique Africaine and blocking several social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Viber and WhatsApp. The OHCHR urged Burundi to adopt measures to protect free expression, including free speech and demonstration, and to protect free and fair elections in the country. The call echoes that made by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile], who said in April that the upcoming elections in Burundi <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">place the nation at a critical moment in history</a> [JURIST report], with an opportunity to choose free and fair elections to "strengthen and mature Burundi's still fragile democracy, and enable an improvement in its dire socio-economic situation."</p>

<p>Although Burundi has recently adopted various treaties pledging respect for human rights, there have been a string of accusations against Burundi for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">committed at least 47 extrajudicial executions</a> [JURIST report] following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. Earlier that month, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">expressed concerns about freedom of expression in Burundi</a> [JURIST report] following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine. In November the OHCHR reported that human rights activists in Burundi are <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/burundi-government-hounds-human-rights-activists.php">treated as political opponents</a> [JURIST report] by the state and subject to physical threats, anonymous phone calls, arbitrary arrests, assaults and judicial harassment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: Saudi-led alliance used cluster bombs in Yemen airstrikes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Sunday that it has received credible evidence indicating that the Saudi-led coalition <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/03/yemen-saudi-led-airstrikes-used-cluster-munitions">used illegal cluster munitions</a> [press release] supplied by the US in airstrikes against Houthi forces in Yemen. According to a report by HRW, satellite imagery indicates that the munitions landed "within 600 meters of several dozen buildings in four to six village clusters." Cluster bombs spread bomblets over a wide area, many of which do not immediately explode, allowing the bomblets to kill or maim civilians long after a conflict ends. They were prohibited by a 2008 treaty adopted by 116 countries, not including Saudi Arabia, Yemen or the US. Saudi Arabia has denied using cluster munitions during its month-long campaign against the rebels in Yemen. </p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. Last week the UN reported that the intense fighting in Yemen has <a href="paperchase/2015/04/un-civilian-death-toll-in-yemen-rises.php">claimed the lives of 551 civilians</a> [JURIST report], including 115 children. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php">condemned the targeting of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. Also last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged Yemeni combatants to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">report attacks resulting in civilian casualties</a> [JURIST report] so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Togo's constitutional court declared Faure Gnassingbe president for a third five-year term after tallying votes on Sunday. Head of the Constitutional Court Aboudou Assouma said on state television that the final results show that Gnassingbe receive a majority of the votes with about 59 percent. Gnassingbe's main challenger, Jean-Pierre Fabre, received about 35 percent of the votes. "Having obtained a majority of the votes, Faure Gnassingbe must be declared president," <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/togo-dictator-son-faure-gnassingbe-wins-3rd-term-president/">said Assouma</a> [AP report]. The opposition did not immediately react to the final results Sunday. Earlier this week, Fabre rejected provisional results and called for people to mobilize by all legal means. Gnassingbe will be sworn in as president on Monday. </p>

<p>The win extends the Gnassingbe family's rule of Togo to nearly 50 years. Gnassingbe <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/togo-revises-constitution-to-allow.php">took office</a> [JURIST report] in February 2005 immediately following the death of his father, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/830774.stm">Gnassingbe Eyadema</a> [BBC obituary], who was president of Togo for 38 years and one of the country's longest serving leaders. Gnassingbe's <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/two-killed-protesting-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional succession to office</a> [JURIST report] was met with international outcry, and <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/ecowas-sanctions-imposed-as-pressure.php">pressure</a> from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries led to his <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/togo-president-steps-down-african.php">resignation</a> [JURIST reports]. Togo's Parliament then named Abass Bonfoh, a member of the ruling party, as acting president. In May 2005 the constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/togo-constitutional-court-confirms.php">confirmed</a> Gnassingbe as the <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/togo-election-commission-declares.php">official winner</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/togo-opposition-leader-claims.php">disputed presidential election</a> [JURIST reports]. Gnassingbe <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/togo-court-affirms-contested-election.php">won re-election</a> [JURIST report] in 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Puerto Rican <a href="http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov">Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Sunday <a href="http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/gobernador-ordena-viabilizar-uso-medicinal-de-productos-derivados-del-cannabis">signed an executive order</a> [press release, in Spanish] legalizing medical marijuana. The order refers to several US studies that show the therapeutic use of the plant in treating different medical conditions including pain associated with AIDS, glaucoma, migraines, Alzheimers, Parkinson's and other diseases. He further noted that several US states have already legalized medical marijuana for these uses. The executive order will authorize the Secretary of Health to intervene excessively in the reclassification of the controlled substance for medical use but added that a sharp distinction will be drawn for medical use versus non-medical use. A legislative vote to legalize medical marijuana had failed in the past. Upon signing, the governor said, "[w]e are taking a significant step forward in the area of ​​health is crucial to our development and quality of life. I'm sure many patients receive proper treatment that will give them new hope and high expectations of life for these."</p>

<p>The legal use and sale of <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for both medical and recreational purposes has been a controversial issue in the US with a number of states contemplating various legalization initiatives. In late March Colorado <a href="http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov">Attorney General Cynthia Coffman</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/colorado-asks-supreme-court-to-throw-out-marijuana-case.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to throw out a lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization law. In November voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/residents-in-alaska-oregon-dc-vote-to-legalize-marijuana.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to legalize recreational marijuana. In September the Pennsylvania State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST Report] legislation that would legalize several forms of medical marijuana. In July Illinois Governor Pat Quinn <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/illinois-governor-signs-bill-expanding-medical-marijuana-for-seizures.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] legislation that will allow adults and children suffering from seizures access to medical marijuana. Last April the Maryland House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/maryland-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-116_9o6b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bullard-v-hyde-park-savings-bank/">Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of a debtor's proposed repayment plan is not a final order that the debtor can immediately appeal. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. In the opinion, the court stressed the unique characteristics of bankruptcy proceedings, in comparison to ordinary civil litigation and grappled with the appropriate limits of an immediately appealable proceeding in the context of <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter13.aspx">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</a> [US Courts backgrounder] plans. The petitioner, Bullard, asked the court to view each proposed repayment plan submitted to the bankruptcy court as a unique proceeding. Whereas, the respondent viewed each proposed plan as a part of the larger proceeding that is subject to a final action only when a plan is confirmed, or alternatively, if the debtor fails to offer any confirmable plan resulting in the dismissal of the case. The court held in favor of the bank, stating:<blockquote>The relevant proceeding is the process of attempting to arrive at an approved plan that would allow the bankruptcy to move forward. This is so, first and foremost, because only plan confirmation&#8212;or case dismissal&#8212;alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties.  When the bankruptcy court confirms a plan, its terms become binding on debtor and creditor alike.</blockquote>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-bankruptcy-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in early April. At oral arguments, the court evaluated the practical implications of whether debtors would have an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/04/argument-analysis-justices-weigh-practicalities-of-appellate-review-of-decisions-rejecting-bankruptcy-plans/">adequate opportunity to seek appellate review</a> [SCOTUSblog op-ed] if the plan denial itself is not treated as an appealable order. The justices addressed three mechanisms for appeal that would remain if the denial itself could not be appealed: interlocutory appeal, refuse to accept the rejected plan and appeal following dismissal of the action, or propose a plan that is eventually accepted by the bankruptcy court and appeal the accepted plan. In Monday's opinion, the court held that a debtor whose proposed repayment plan was rejected is not without means to appeal its decision through an interlocutory appeal and an order denying confirmation of a proposed repayment plan is not a final action.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Monday upheld death sentences for five members of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] on charges of killing policemen in 2013. The charges include attempted murder, weapons possession and violence stemming from an incident known as the "Kerdasa massacre," when supporters of the former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morsi">news archive</a>] stormed a police station killing 11 policemen and two civilians. Hundreds of other Brotherhood leaders and members have been sentenced for the violence associated with the massacre. The five defendants were originally sentenced last month, and Monday's <a href="http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=316632">ruling</a> [IANS report] comes after approval by the the mufti of the republic, the highest religious authority in the country. The sentence can still be appealed to a higher court.</p>

<p>The past year has seen a significant government crackdown on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and former president Morsi, punctuated with a number of mass arrests and death sentences. In early February a court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] death sentences for 183 supporters of the banned Muslim Brotherhood and ousted president Morsi, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said that it has gathered evidence that the Egyptian government is <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-egypt-government-covering-up-deaths-on-anniversary-of-uprising.php">covering up the deaths</a> [JURIST report] of more than two dozen people who died in protests on the anniversary of the 2011 uprisings. In January security forces in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egypt-authorities-arrest-516-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] 516 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood according to Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim. Also in January an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egyptian-court-orders-retrial-for-152-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">ordered the retrial</a> [JURIST report] for 152 Muslim Brotherhood supporters sentenced in a mass trial last year. Thirty-seven were sentenced to death, and 115 others were sentenced to life imprisonment for their roles in attacks against Egyptian Christians and their churches in August 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/050415zor_7648.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] and consolidated a pair of cases that concern the scope of the <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC) authority to regulate <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/demand-response.asp">demand response</a> [FERC backgrounder] technology based on its impact on wholesale electricity rates under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/chapter-12">Federal Power Act</a> (FPA) [text]. The cases are <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/enernoc-inc-v-electric-power-supply-association/">EnerNOC, Inc. v. Electric Power Supply Association</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/federal-energy-regulatory-commission-v-electric-power-supply-association/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Electric Power Supply Association</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from consideration of the court's motion and review of the two petitions. The questions presented as stated by the court are:<blockquote>1) Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 USC &#167 791(a) et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates; and, 2) Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote><a href="http://www.ferc.gov/for-citizens/about-ferc.asp">FERC has jurisdiction</a> [FERC backgrounder] over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, and over regulations that affect the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce. Authority over retail electricity sales commonly falls under state's public utility commissions. In the second case, <span class="casename">FERC v. EPSA</span>, the court must decide if FERC exceeded its authority under the FPA when it issued <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20110315105757-RM10-17-000.pdf">Order 745</a> [text, PDF] in 2011, thereby creating new regulations for demand response transactions at wholesale. Demand response is a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/05/court-enlists-u-s-views-on-colorado-marijuana-case/#more-228012">broad new program</a> [SCOTUSblog op-ed] that seeks to develop consumer participation in the electricity supply market, in which consumers receive a payment for reductions in electricity use during peak times. <a href="http://www.enernoc.com">EnerNOC</a> [official website] is a leading provider of energy intelligence software (EIS) that allows energy consumers to reduce energy costs, optimize energy consumption, participate in demand response, and manage peak demand. Last May the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DE531DBFA7DE1ABE85257CE1004F4C53/$file/11-1486-1494281.pdf">vacated Order 745</a> [opinion, PDF], holding that FERC did overstep its authority because Order 745 is a direct attempt to regulate the retail market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.senato.it/home">Italian Parliament</a> [official website, in Italian] on Monday approved a controversial electoral overhaul designed to bring increased political stability to the country. The law provides new electoral rules that will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32584708">provide</a> [BBC report] a majority of electoral seats to a clear winner of an election. The winning party will be defined as one that receives at least 40 percent of the electoral vote, and 340 of the 630 seats in the lower house of parliament will be reserved for that party. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25265945">Prime Minister Matteo Renzi</a> [BBC profile] pushed the reform through as one of several campaign promises after a year of debate. He issued a statement saying, "Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no." Opposition parties believe the reform provides an excess of power to single political parties and retracts the right of voters to directly choose their representatives. They have characterized the law as "undemocratic." Despite opposition, the rules will take effect in July 2016.</p>

<p>Renzi has promised other political and economic reforms designed to increase stability in Italy, which has had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-italy-politics-idUSKBN0NP0TN20150504">63 governments</a> [Reuters report] since World War II. He has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32584708">expressed plans</a> [BBC report] to further transform the Italian system by replacing the Senate with a non-elected body with lesser powers, as a way to provide more checks on legislation that is currently routinely held up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/articles/news/2015/05/syrias-circle-of-hell-barrel-bombs-in-aleppo/">condemned</a> [press release] both the Syrian Assad Regime and anti-government rebels for committing human rights abuses and war crimes in the Syrian city of Aleppo. AI's 74-page <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/1370/2015/en/">report</a> [materials], based on interviews with current and former residents of Aleppo, documents "unthinkable atrocities" in the city, including the systematic use of barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy city infrastructure. AI's Middle East and North Africa director, Phillip Luther, commented on the widespread atrocities, indicating that the "vicious and unrelenting aerial bombardment of civilian neighborhoods by government forces have made life for civilians in Aleppo increasingly unbearable." AI called for both sides of the conflict, as well as the Syrian government, to be held accountable for their violations of international human rights law.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26116868">Syrian conflict</a> [BBC report] is <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-syria-violence-continues-after-5-years-of-conflict.php">entering its fifth year</a> [JURIST report], and has already seen almost 200,000 Syrians lose their lives in a civil war based around the legitimacy of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC report]. The conflict in Syria has had devastating effects on the general population as a result of the extreme measures taken by both sides. In March a UN rights group <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-investigators-call-for-prosecution-of-war-crimes-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about atrocities and abuses in Syria by both the Assad regime and anti-government armed groups. In February of last year, human rights experts under the office of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-syria-un-rights-experts.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that both camps were committing crimes against humanity, denying civilians basic necessities of life and humanitarian aid. One month later, a panel of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-syria-rebels-committed-mass-executions-of-civilians.php">presented a report</a> [JURIST report] that depicted the Syrian rebel practice of "execution fields" where mass killings were committed through the use of barrel bomb attacks. In April of last year the human rights chief stated that the Syrian government's human rights abuses <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-rights-chief-syria-government-abuses-far-outweigh-rebels.php">far outweighed</a> [JURIST report] those of the rebels. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Burundi's Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13085065">President Pierre Nkurunziza</a> [BBC profile] can seek a third term in office without violating the country's constitution, which states that presidents shall be universally elected into office for a term of five years and can renew the term once. Nkurunziza was appointed to the presidency by the legislature in 2005 and elected by citizens for a second term in 2010. The court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/burundi-court-validates-presidents-term-bid-30807664">reasoned</a> [AP report] that because he was not elected for his first term, Nkurunziza could constitutionally be elected into office once more. But not everyone agrees with the court's decision. Protesters have <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/burundi-constitutional-court-allows-presidents-third-term-bid-092420335.html">demonstrated</a> [AFP report] for over a week against Nkurunziza's decision to seek another term, leaving at least 13 people dead and nearly 600 arrested. Judge Sylvere Nimpagaritse, the only judge to disagree with the ruling, fled the country to Rwanda fearing death threats. Rwanda's Foreign Affairs Ministry expressed <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-05-05/188495/">concern</a> [<em>Rwanda New Times</em> report] over the situation in Burundi and the hundreds of Burundian citizens escaping to their country. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] also expressed concerned on Monday over the president's acting against the constitution. Presidential elections in Burundi are scheduled for June 26. </p>

<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] Friday over actions by Burundian authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections. The OHCHR said last month that the upcoming elections in Burundi place the nation at a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">critical moment in history</a> [JURIST report], urging the nation to choose democracy in the elections. Burundi has also been criticized for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police committed at least 47 <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">extrajudicial executions</a> [JURIST report] following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. Earlier that month, the OHCHR expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">concerns about freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report] in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201212928.enb.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that police may obtain historical cell phone tower location information from third-party businesses without a search warrant. Quartavius Davis was convicted for committing seven separate armed robberies between August and October 2010 in South Florida. The prosecutor presented evidence in trial of cell tower records form MetroPCS during those two months, showing that cell towers connecting Davis' calls at the time of each robbery were near the locations of most of the robberies. The opinion, written by Circuit Judge Frank Hull, said there is a diminished expectation of privacy in certain records turned over to third parties, including cell tower locations, because a reasonable caller knows that his cell phone will send signals to nearby towers and voluntarily conveys this information to third parties. The court deemed this to be a voluntary action because phones do not transmit cell tower signals continuously but do so only when the user decides to make a call. Obtaining the company's records did not violate his rights against a warrantless search because the defendant never owned or controlled the information; it was exclusively in MetroPCS's possession. The court also found that disclosure of cell tower records serves a compelling government interest in apprehending criminals. </p>

<p>There has been much legal debate regarding <a href="/hotline/2014/08/adam-banner-cell-phone-searches.php">cell phone searches</a> [JURIST op-ed]. A judge for the <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/virginia_beach/home.html">2nd Judicial District of Virginia</a> [official website] ruled in November that police can force criminal suspects to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/virginia-judge-rules-police-can-require-suspect-to-unlock-cell-phone-with-fingerprint.php">unlock their cell phones</a> [JURIST report] with a fingerprint scanner to allow officers to open and search them, but that officers may not compel suspects to give up their phone pass codes. Last June the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that police officers <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-warrant-required-to-search-arrestees-cell-phone.php">must obtain a warrant</a> [JURIST report] before searching a person's cell phone data, even at the time of arrest. The court also held that while the police may not search the cell phone data, they may search the cell phone itself to make sure it cannot be used as a weapon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] California's <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/">State Water Resources Control Board</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2015/pr050515_water_conservation.pdf">approved rules</a> [press release, PDF; <a href="http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/drought/emergency_regulations_waterconservation.shtml">materials</a>] that will limit how people, governments and businesses can use water during the state's drought, promoting deep conservation efforts in the process. The rules include forcing cities to limit watering on public property and encouraging homeowners to let their lawns die. California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/m_about.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] was a strong supporter of the stringent regulations, arguing that water agencies should cut down urban water use by 25 percent from their 2013 level to help yield the water savings necessary during a four-year drought. It is unclear what penalties local agencies and the state water board will impose on those that don't meet the water use targets. Moreover, the board lacks staff to supervise each of the hundreds of water agencies. Some agencies do not have the resources necessary to issue tickets to those who waste water or fail to meet the restrictions. Under the new rules, each city is required to cut water use by close to 36 percent compared with 2013 levels. This has created skepticism among local water departments who see the proposal as unrealistic since it could cause higher water bills and declining property values.</p>

<p>California's water restriction issues have been a hot topic for several years now. On April 1, Brown issued <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/4.1.15_Executive_Order.pdf">Executive Order B-29-15</a> [text, PDF], which mandates water-use restrictions throughout the state and which will remain in effect through February 28, 2017. JURIST Guest Columnist Griffen Thorne, Student at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, argued that the legal framework these restrictions establish could <a href="/dateline/2015/04/griffen-thorne-water-use.php">produce lasting effects</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the state by incentivizing water reductions and innovation. The order also incentivizes investment in energy-efficient technology, in a step towards ensuring that future generations of Californians will have better access to water. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] launched a website on Tuesday <a href="http://albinism.ohchr.org/">aimed at disproving</a> [official website] the myths of albinism, the rare condition which is still misunderstood both socially and medically. Albinism affects from one in 5,000 to one in 15,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> [official website]. Hundreds of ritual attacks against persons with albinism, specifically children, have been reported in many different countries, and more cases may remain undocumented or unreported because victims are ostracized in many cases. At least 15 albinos have been abducted, wounded or killed the past six months in different African countries. The website contains information on key human rights issues that people with albinism deal with on a daily basis, including stories from musicians, athletes, activists, doctors and judges who are working to make an effort to falsify the myths and make sure that people with albinism can live a life without fear and violence.</p>

<p>The treatment of albinos in Africa and neighboring countries has been a highly contested human rights issue for many years. In August the OHCHR said that the Tanzanian government's system of placing children with albinism in government care centers does not provide this vulnerable group with <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/more-protection-needed-for-tanzania-albinos-un-rights-office.php">adequate protection</a> [JURIST report] from those who target albinos due to erroneous beliefs and superstitions. Last May then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14601&LangID=E">increased protection</a> [press release] for people with albinism after the murder of a 40-year old woman with albinism, adding that the killing demonstrated that the human rights situation for people with albinism in Tanzania and other countries remains dire. In March 2013 Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-attacks-on-albinos-in-tanzania.php">condemned the increase</a> [JURIST report] in attacks on those with albinism in Tanzania. Her statement came after four attacks on albinos, including three children, took place over a 16-day period. Up to that point there were 72 murders of albinos since 2000 in Tanzania.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] France's <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French], the lower house of parliament, approved <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/projets/pl2669.asp">Bill relating to Intelligence (No. 2669)</a> [text, in French] on Tuesday, which would allow authorities to increase surveillance of anyone linked to terrorism investigations without permission from a judge. The bill <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/france-passes-new-surveillance-law-in-wake-of-charlie-hebdo-attack">authorizes</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] intelligence agencies to tap e-mails and phone calls, place recording cameras inside homes, and install devices that monitor computer keystrokes in real time. It would also require Internet providers and communication companies to search through metadata to flag suspicious behavior and send it to police. Lawmakers voted 438 to 86 to pass the law, which was supported by <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">French President François Hollande</a> [official website, in French], and will next be sent to the Senate for approval. Hollande also indicated he will refer the law to the constitutional council to ensure its constitutionality. Supporters of the law <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/spy-bill-passes-in-frances-lower-house-1430857017">claim it is necessary</a> [WSJ report] because the previous legal framework is outdated and it will be more efficient. Critics of the surveillance law, however, say it will cause mass surveillance and infringe on individual freedom and privacy.</p>

<p>The new law was proposed weeks after an <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-sg-condemns-attack-on-french-magazine.php">attack was perpetrated</a> [JURIST report] by masked gunmen who entered the office of the magazine Charlie Hebdo and left 17 people dead over three days. After the tragedy, French police <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/french-police-arrest-54-people-for-supporting-terrorism.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] dozens of people for verbally supporting or threatening terrorist acts, including four minors and French comedian Dieudonne who is known for his anti-Semitic views. The French Justice Ministry also called on prosecutors to crack down on hate speech, anti-Semitism and support of terrorism. The French government began pushing the bill in March, hoping that such action would <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">prevent an imminent terror attack</a> [JURIST report]. Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/france-lamekers-debate-controversial-surveillance-bill.php">began debating</a> [JURIST report] the bill the following month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghanistan's Primary Court in Kabul sentenced four men to death on Tuesday for the mob killing of a 27-year-old Afghan woman in March. Farkhunda was killed March 19 after being accused of burning a copy of the Koran, although an investigation later determined she never did. The attack was captured on cell phone cameras as Farkhunda was beaten, thrown from a roof, run over by a car and dragged to a river bank. The nationally-televised trial had 49 suspects, including 19 police officers, charged with murder, assault and encouraging others to engage in assault. Four were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/05/06/mob-killing-woman/26967669/">sentenced</a> [AP report] to death, eight defendants were sentenced to 16 years in prison, and several others are scheduled to be sentenced on Sunday. Judge Safiullah Mojadedi dismissed the cases against 18 of the defendants. Mojadedi also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/afghan-trial-begins-49-suspects-police-brutal-mob-killing-woman-farkhunda">ordered</a> [AP report] another police officer arrested for allegedly freeing a suspect in this case. The trial began just four days ago. </p>

<p>Farkhunda's brutal killing has led to increased calls for Afghan authorities to protect women from violence. In April a report released by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said Afghanistan women's rights activists are <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">facing increased violence</a> [JURIST report] and a lack of governmental support. Also last month the <a href="http://www.unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official websites] reported that Afghanistan must <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-afghanistan-should-strengthen-justice-system-to-protect-women.php">strengthen its criminal justice system</a> [JURIST report] to provide protection for women victims of domestic violence. There was already much existing criticism over the <a href="/hotline/2014/03/heather-barr-criminal-code-revisions.php">lack of protection for women</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Afghanistan before Farkhunda's death as well. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, called on the government of Afghanistan and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-calls-for-protection-of-womens-rights-in-afghanistan.php">address the causes and consequences</a> [JURIST report] of violence against women in the country. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] encouraged the former Afghan President Hamid Karzai last February to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">refuse to sign</a> [JURIST report] a law passed by parliament that some say could have denied women protection from domestic violence and forced marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Burundi authorities arrested political opposition leader Audifax Ndabitoreye on Wednesday shortly after he met with <a href="http://www.eac.int">East African Community</a> (EAC) [official website] ministers in the capital city of Bujumbura. Ndabitoreye was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/burundian-police-arrest-opposition-leader">arrested for insurrection</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], and the police displayed an arrest warrant to journalists as he was taken into custody. The EAC is the regional intergovernmental organization of the Republics of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Leaders from the EAC traveled to Burundi on Wednesday to assist with the political and social unrest in the country, following a ruling from the nation's Constitutional Court on Tuesday that approved President Pierre Nkurunziza's request to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">run for a third presidential term</a> [JURIST report] despite the two-term limit on the office of the presidency in the state's constitution. The level of protests and social unrest has seen a dramatic increase since Tuesday's court ruling, and eyewitness accounts report the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/burundi-president-to-defy-international-pressure-and-run-for-third-term">use of live ammunition and grenades</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to dispel protesters in the capital. At least 40,000 people have fled Burundi in recent months, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32618391">threat of regional social and economic harm</a> [BBC report] has compelled neighboring states to take action.  </p>

<p>Political unrest in Burundi has divided the country and many citizens have fled the country, following Nkurunziza's declaration that he intends to seek a third term in office. Burundi has also been criticized for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. Earlier this week the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over actions by Burundi authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections in June. In April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to the upcoming elections in Burundi <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">as a critical moment in the nation's history</a> [JURIST report], with an opportunity to choose free and fair elections to "strengthen and mature Burundi's still fragile democracy, and enable an improvement in its dire socio-economic situation." Also in April, the OHCHR expressed concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">limits placed on freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report] in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine (RPA). </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] on Wednesday opened an investigation into potential antitrust violations in the e-commerce market with the scope of the investigation including a number of the world's largest technology and search companies. The commission seeks to <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4921_en.htm">identify any possible anti-competitive behavior</a> [official press release] that is limiting trade in the 28-country EU. The commission derives its authority from Articles <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101">101</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E102">102</a> of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU) [text]. Europe's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, is leading the investigation. The regulators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/business/international/european-commission-e-commerce-inquiry-american-tech-companies.html?_r=0">did not name any specific companies</a> [NYT report] as targets of the investigation, but Amazon is the largest e-commerce company in the region and the investigation will likely cover other large technology companies, such as Google and Facebook. The official inquiry into potential antitrust violations falls under the European Commission's strategy to develop a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/index_en.htm">digital single market</a> [European Commission backgrounder] for Europe that will not limit cross-border trade. The digital single market strategy is comprised of three pillars: better online access to digital goods and services across Europe, creating an environment where digital networks and services can prosper, and maximizing the growth potential of the digital economy. The European Commission also <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4919_en.htm">outlined 16 initiatives</a> [European Commission backgrounder] that the Commission intends to deliver with its digital single market strategy. The commission expects to publish a preliminary report in mid-2016 and a final report is expected in the first quarter of 2017. </p>

<p>The world's largest technology companies have faced antitrust charges in the US and internationally in recent months. In April, the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/eu-initiates-antitrust-proceedings-against-google.php">initiated antitrust proceedings against Google</a> [JURIST report] accusing the company of utilizing its dominant position in the search engine market to hurt competitors. In February a judge for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-google-antitrust-suit.php">dismissed a class action suit against Google</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly monopolizing search engines in Android phones. In September of last year a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-judge-approves-settlement-in-ebay-antitrust-case.php">approved a settlement between federal antitrust authorities and eBay</a> [JURIST report] over allegations that eBay agreed to not to selectively recruit and hire employees from rival companies. In June <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/apple-settles-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">Apple reached an out-of-court settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice regarding a class action lawsuit that accused the electronics company of illegally participating in a e-book price-fixing scheme.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF] does not authorize the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] to collect millions of Americans' phone records. The court found that section 215 of the act did not preclude judicial review and remanded the case for further consideration to determine if NSA's actions were constitutional. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">alleged in the complaint</a> [JURIST report] filed last June that the program violates the rights of free speech and association as well as the right of privacy protected by the First and Fourth Amendments. </p>

<p>Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counter-terrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring.The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the ACLU, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Oklahoma <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ok.gov/triton/modules/newsroom/newsroom_article.php?id=223&article_id=15798">signed</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1409">House Bill 1409</a> [legislative materials] into law Wednesday extending the mandatory waiting period for women seeking an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. Fallin said the new law, "will allow for more time to consider medical risks as well as explore alternatives to abortion, such as adoption." The bill also requires that abortion facilities that operate a website include a link to the state sponsored website <a href="http://www.awomansright.org/">A Woman's Right to Know</a> [website]. The bill will take effect November 1, making Oklahoma the fourth state to require a 72-hour waiting period. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to be a hotly debated legal issue throughout the US, with a number of state legislatures proposing laws to limit abortion. In April Tennessee lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/tennessee-lawmakers-approve-abortion-restriction-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] two measures that are expected to be signed into law by <a href="http://www.tn.gov/governor/">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website] and will require state abortion clinics to be licensed as surgical centers and require women to wait 48 hours after receiving counseling before being able to get an abortion. Also in April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat has been detected, and Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In March Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Doug Ducey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion and also bars women from buying any health care plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Earlier in March the West Virginia Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] Governor Earl Ray Tomblin's veto, passing a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday reported that Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have begun to crack down on freedom of expression, detaining students for their political affiliations or political criticism. In the past six months, according to HRW, at least four West Bank students <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/07/palestine-students-detained-political-opinions-0">have been detained</a> [HRW report], seemingly for connections with Hamas or making statements of political dissent. HRW Middle East and North Africa director Sarah Leah Whitson called the situation "deeply worrying," saying that "Palestinians should be able to express critical political opinions without being arrested or beaten." Two Palestinian students were allegedly arrested because of things they had posted on Facebook. Journalism student Ayman Mahariq from West Bank's Al Quds University stated that after being brought to a police station by plainclothes policemen in 2014 he was beaten and faced criminal charges for posting critical comments about Palestinian Authority forces on Facebook, and that he was held for 30 days. Media student Bara al-Qadi from Birzeit University was arrested in January for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bara.alqadi/posts/10152994668117980">criticizing a Palestinian Authority official</a> [Facebook post, in Arabic] on Facebook and was held for 13 days. Adnan Al-Dimiri, a spokesman for Palestinian Security Forces in the West Bank, denied earlier this month that the arrests were politically motivated, saying that they "never arrest people for their speech or their political affiliations." He said that the arrests instead stemmed from charges of "incitement of sectarian violence and other criminal charges."</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/internet-freedom/">Internet freedom</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains a controversial issue around the world. In March India's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/india-court-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-offensive-facebook-speech.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that gave authorities the power to jail people for offensive online posts. In December the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-threatening-social-media-posts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case involving threatening rap lyrics posted to Facebook. Last year the Turkish president <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/turkish-president-approves-law-tightening-internet-control.php">approved a law</a >[JURIST report] that tightens the government control of the Internet and expands the powers of the telecoms authority. In 2013 a Canadian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">unveiled research</a> [JURIST report] indicating that a number of nations are using American-made Internet surveillance technology that could be used to censor content and track their citizens. The UN Human Rights Council in July 2012 passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect the free speech</a> [JURIST report] of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. Also in 2012 China <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">adopted stricter rules</a> [JURIST report] on both Internet providers and users. In November 2012 Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] giving the nation the authority to completely block access to certain websites.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="https://albertacourts.ca/court-of-appeal">Alberta Court of Appeal</a> [official website] on Thursday ruled that former Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Omar+Khadr">Omar Khadr</a> [JURIST news archive] can be released on bail while he appeals his US war crimes conviction. According to Justice Myra Bielby, the ruling was based on her belief that there was "no clear evidence there would be irreparable harm if he was released." The judge also <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/07/world/canada-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr-bail/index.html?eref">rejected arguments</a> [CNN report] made by government lawyers that Khadr's release would damage Canada's foreign relations. He will be required under the terms of his bail to live with his attorney and submit to electronic monitoring and a curfew. Khadr, 28, is a Canadian citizen who was captured by US forces at the age of 15 after being found fighting in Afghanistan in 2002. He spent eight years in Guantanamo before being convicted on five charges and sentenced to eight years in prison for war crimes. The US <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-khadr-to-canada.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] Khadr to Canada in 2012. A lawyer for Khadr <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/khadr-lawyer-requests-bail-while-appeal-is-processed.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] his client be released on bail in March, arguing that given the amount of time his appeal was taking to process, Kadhr's sentence could be completed before a decision could be reached. </p>

<p>The US military prison at <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued to generate controversy. In February the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pentagon-announces-retraction-of-military-judge-relocation-rule.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a rule that would have attempted to speed up the litigation process in military commission prosecutions by requiring judges to relocate to Guantanamo. In January a group of US senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/senators-propose-legislation-to-halt-release-transfers-of-guantanamo-inmates.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would place a moratorium on the releases or transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo. Also in January a lawyer for former Guantanamo detainee David Hicks said the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-government-admits-former-guantanamo-detainee-wrongfully-convicted-lawyer.php">admitted the conviction was incorrect</a> [JURIST report] and did not dispute Hicks' innocence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/I-594%20Order%20Dismissing%20Case.pdf">dismissed</a> [order, PDF] a lawsuit challenging a state law requiring universal background checks for all gun transfers, including noncommercial, online or gun show sales. In November voters passed <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/finaltext_483.pdf">Initiative 594</a> [text, PDF] with 59 percent of the vote. The <a href="http://www.saf.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NWSSvFergie.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF], brought fourth by several Washington-based companies and the <a href="https://www.saf.org/">Second Amendment Foundation</a> (SAF) [advocacy website], argued that the law is too vague for ordinary people to understand and infringes on citizens' Second Amendment rights. Judge Benjamin Settle threw out the case because the plaintiffs did not have standing, saying that they could not challenge the law because they have not been prosecuted for violating it and have not shown an immediate threat of prosecution. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Second Amendment</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and gun control have been controversial political issues in the US in recent years. Earlier this month Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/vermont-governor-signs-new-gun-restrictions-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that creates new restrictions on who may own guns in the state. In February a judge for the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] ruled that the ban on interstate handgun sales by federal firearm dealers is <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-ban-on-interstate-handgun-sales.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. SAF <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/lawsuit-challenges-dc-newly-enacted-concealed-carry-laws.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in February challenging the District of Columbia's right to deny concealed carry permits to individuals for failure to show good cause. The <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/nra-sues-3-pennsylvania-cities-over-local-gun-ordinances.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in January against the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, alleging local gun laws violate a state law that restricts local regulation of firearms and ammunition. Last November a group of California gun dealers <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/gun-dealers-challenge-california-law-limiting-advertisments.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court challenging a state law that limits their right to advertise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN human rights experts on Friday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50799#.VU0VEPlViko">condemned</a> [press release] the growing number of executions in Iran in recent years. According to the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Iran and on extrajudicial executions, Iran has executed about 350 people in 2015 and executed approximately <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15937&LangID=E">six people per day</a> [press release] between April 9 and April 26. This year, Iran has performed 15 public executions, which the experts say "have a dehumanizing effect on both the victim and those who witness the execution, reinforcing the already cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of the death penalty." Iran also executed at least 852 people between July 2013 and June 2014. Many of the crimes for which prisoners were executed were not "most serious crimes," such as drug offenses. The new <a href="http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/human-rights-documents/iranian-codes/3200-islamic-penal-code-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran-book-one-and-book-two.html">Islamic Penal Code</a> [text] enacted by Iran in 2013 still permits death sentences for juveniles and for crimes like adultery, and repeated alcohol use. The UN is urging Iran to institute a moratorium on the death penalty and consider abolishing the practice.</p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its use of the death penalty. In February Iran reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/iran-executes-juvenile-offender.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] Saman Naseem, a juvenile offender who was 17 years old when sentenced to death, despite international pressure to halt the execution. UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-rights-investigator-urges-iran-to-halt-execution-of-sexual-assault-victim.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iran in April to immediately halt the execution of Reyhaneh Jabbari. Jabbari was <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-expert-shocked-over-iran-womans-execution.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] the following October despite international opposition. Last June former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-chief-condemns-juvenile-execution-in-iran.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran's use of the death penalty for juvenile offenders and called on authorities to halt the announced execution of Razieh Ebrahimi, who was 14 years old when sentenced to death. Also in June a group of independent UN human rights experts condemned Iran's <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-iran-should-abolish-death-penalty.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of a political prisoner, calling for the country to end the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Attorney General<a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag"> Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-opens-pattern-or-practice-investigation-baltimore-police-department">announced </a>[press release] the launch of a federal civil rights investigation into Baltimore's police. Authorities,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/us-launches-its-own-investigation-of-baltimore-police/2015/05/08/318efa0a-f5f5-11e4-bca5-21b51bbdf93e_story.html"> Lynch said</a> [AP report], would look for discriminating practices by police and begin to review allegations of unlawful searches, seizures and arrests as well as excessive force, and they would seek a court enforceable agreement to address any unconstitutional policies or practices found. The investigation is set to build upon a review of the Baltimore police that began last year, which the government conducted voluntarily and collaboratively. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] in conducting its investigation will consider all relevant information, though special attention will be paid to both the efforts undertaken by the Baltimore Police Department to comply with federal law and the views and experiences of the community. The announcement follows days of rioting in response to the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, which Lynch said showed a "serious erosion of public trust." This investigation is separate from the department's criminal civil rights investigation related to Gray's death and will be conducted by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. </p>

<p>Racial tension has recently mounted in the US following several police killings of unarmed black men. Last week the State&#8217;s Attorney for Baltimore City <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-charged-in-freddie-gray-death.php">charged six police officers</a> [JURIST report] with crimes including murder and manslaughter over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict </a>[JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who last year<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/"> shot and killed Micheal Brown</a> [USA Today Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with<a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php"> AI reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A United Nations body responsible for protecting displaced people on Friday <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/554c83d46.html">warned </a>[press release] that many of the promising developments made in recent refugee history in Africa are at risk of being undone as over 50,000 people have fled Burundi in response to the start of the pre-election violence that began last month. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] has appealed to Burundi to ensure that the borders remain open and that people be allowed to move freely, as many trying to flee face difficulties ranging from threats of rape to roadblocks. Protests in the country's capital, Bujumbura, which resumed since Monday, have been accompanied by reports of daily violence in the city. "With the Government of Rwanda," UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said, "we are now moving the refugees to a new refugee camp, Mahama, which can host up to 60,000 refugees." These efforts come as UNHCR has noted more and more people arriving from urban areas, including high school and university students, in addition to the many arrivals from the Ngozi and Muyinga provinces of northern Burundi. </p>

<p>Political unrest in Burundi has divided the country and many citizens have fled the country, following Nkurunziza's declaration that he intends to seek a third term in office. Burundi has also been criticized for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. Earlier this week Burundi authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-police-arrest-opposition-leader-for-meeting-with-african-delegates.php">arrested </a>[JURIST report] political opposition leader Audifax Ndabitoreye shortly after he met with East African Community ministers in the capital city of Bujumbura. Also this week the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over actions by Burundi authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections in June. In April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to the upcoming elections in Burundi as <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">a critical moment in the nation's history</a> [JURIST report], with an opportunity to choose free and fair elections to "strengthen and mature Burundi's still fragile democracy, and enable an improvement in its dire socio-economic situation." Also in April, the OHCHR expressed concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">limits placed on freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report] in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine (RPA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Forces led by Saudi Arabia <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20150508/ml--yemen-4c1ad6842a.html">ordered</a> [AP report] civilians in northern Yemen to evacuate the area by Friday afternoon, declaring that the entire region would be deemed a military target, but also announced plans for a ceasefire next week. The coalition <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/08/middleeast/yemen-violence/">dropped leaflets</a> [CNN report] in the area warning they would strike anything in the Saada province after 7pm on Friday. The order came after Houthis fired rockets over the Saudi border, leaving at least 3 Saudis dead. Nine strikes were reported in Saada on Friday evening, including a complex under rebel control which is believed to store weapons. However, Saudi Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.saudiembassy.net/embassy/adelbio.aspx">Adel al-Jubeir</a> [official profile] announced that a five-day ceasefire would begin Tuesday at 11pm, but only if the Houthis abide by the ceasefire. A coalition of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, began an air campaign against Houthi and Saleh forces on March 26, hoping to restore Yemeni <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/02/2012219133034774204.html">President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi</a> [Al Jazeera profile] to office. </p>

<p>The situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said earlier this month that it has received credible evidence indicating that the Saudi-led coalition used <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-saudi-led-alliance-used-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-airstrikes.php">illegal cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] supplied by the US in airstrikes against Houthi forces in Yemen. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the targeting of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged Yemeni combatants last month to report attacks resulting in <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">civilian casualties</a> [JURIST report] so that they could be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers passed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/07/canada-ex-guantanamo-child-soldier-freed">said</a> [press release] that by releasing Omar Khadr on bail, Canada is taking a "significant step toward ending his ordeal." HRW is urging the Canadian government to rehabilitate Khadr and assist his integration into society. Khadr, 28, is a Canadian citizen who was captured by US forces at the age of 15 after being found fighting in Afghanistan in 2002 as a child soldier. He spent eight years in Guantanamo before being convicted on five charges and sentenced to eight years in prison for war crimes. The US <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-khadr-to-canada.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] Khadr to Canada in 2012, and a Canadian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/canada-court-rules-khadr-may-be-released-on-bail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday he could be released on bail while he appeals his US war crimes conviction. According to HRW, Khadr was abused during interrogations and was not provided with legal counsel until two years after he was detained. Both US and Canada ratified the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</a> [text], which requires that former child soldiers be rehabilitated and that the countries assist in physical and psychological recovery.</p>

<p>The US military prison at <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued to generate controversy. In February the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pentagon-announces-retraction-of-military-judge-relocation-rule.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a rule that would have attempted to speed up the litigation process in military commission prosecutions by requiring judges to relocate to Guantanamo. In January a group of US senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/senators-propose-legislation-to-halt-release-transfers-of-guantanamo-inmates.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would place a moratorium on the releases or transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo. Also in January a lawyer for former Guantanamo detainee David Hicks said the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-government-admits-former-guantanamo-detainee-wrongfully-convicted-lawyer.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] the conviction was incorrect and did not dispute Hicks' innocence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.illinoiscourts.gov">Illinois supreme court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2015/118585.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the 2013 <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/98/PDF/098-0599.pdf">Illinois Pension Law</a> [98-599 text] that attempted to reduce the state's pension deficit by eliminating automatic cost of living increases and extending the retirement age. The law itself would apply to four of the state's five state-funded retirement systems. The state law would have reduced pensions based on a new formula and allowed for employees to freeze their pension and contribute to it like a 401(k). Additionally, the measure delayed retirement for employees under the age of 45 at the time the law was enacted. The 2008 recession decimated the state's pension investment portfolios and the Illinois legislature has worked to pass a law to manage the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-pension-law-court-ruling-20150508-story.html#page=1">$105 billion retirement system debt</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report. <a href="http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/SupremeCourt/Justices/Bio_Karmeier.asp">Justice Lloyd Karmeier</a> [official website] stated in writing the courts opinion that "In enacting the provisions, the General Assembly overstepped the scope of its legislative power. This court is therefore obligated to declare those provisions invalid." </p>

<p>Pension rights have been a controversial issue recently. In November 2014 an Illinois judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/judge-rules-illinois-pension-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] a law designed to fix the pension crisis in the state violates the Illinois constitution. In December a judge for the <a href="http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/apps/detroit/DetroitBK.cfm">US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-court-rules-detroit-eligible-for-bankruptcy.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the city of <a href="/dateline/2013/09/patrick-brady-detroit-bankruptcy.php">Detroit is eligible for bankruptcy</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The insolvent city's <a href="/dateline/2013/08/igor-shleypak-detroit-bankruptcy.php">debt</a> [JURIST op-ed] includes 3.5 billion dollars in pension funds. The bankruptcy was allowed to go forward despite a Michigan state court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/michigan-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] last year which held that the city's filing for bankruptcy violated the Michigan Constitution. The bankruptcy court held that the pension funds could not be treated any differently than other unsecured debt. In March 2013 the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judges-allows-pension-lawsuit-against-jp-morgan-to-continue.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a pension plan holder against <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com">JPMorgan</a>[corporate website; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jp+morgan+chase+and+co">JURIST news archive</a>]. The court found that sufficient allegations were raised to support a claim for breaches of both the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former US government employee with the Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/file/eccleston-indictment/download">charged</a> [indictment, PDF; <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2015/former-u.s.-nuclear-regulatory-commission-employee-charged-with-attempted-spear-phishing-cyber-attack-on-department-of-energy-computers">press release</a>] with a four count violation of federal law in connection with an attempted phishing scheme involving Department of Energy employee emails. Charles Harvey Eccleston, aged 62, was charged two weeks ago, but the indictment were unsealed on Friday after Eccleston made his first appearance before the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov">US District Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website]. The indictment charges Eccleston with four felony offenses including three counts of crimes involving unauthorized access of computers and one count of wire fraud. Eccleston's scheme involved sending emails to federal employee email accounts that contained a virus that would extract sensitive information pertaining to US government nuclear information and send it to individuals in a foreign country. Acting US Attorney Cohen stated "[t]hanks to an innovative operation by the FBI, no malicious code was actually transmitted to government computers. This prosecution demonstrates federal law enforcement's vigorous efforts to neutralize cyber threats that put consumers, our economy, and our national security at risk." The government in the Phillipines detained Eccleston after he came into an embassy stating he had stolen information from the US Government. <a href="http://www.justice.gov">The Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] thanked the Philippine government for their help. Eccleston will remain detained until a hearing scheduled for May 20.  </p>

<p>Due to cybercrime's international reach, many countries have recently began to implement specific laws pertaining to the Internet and cyberspace. In July 2014, police <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/seven-arrested-in-16-million-stubhub-fraud-case.php">arrested seven individuals</a> [JURIST report] on charges connecting them to an international group that defrauded the online ticketing service <a href="http://www.stubhub.com">StubHub</a> [official website] of approximately $1.6 million. In February, the Philippines high court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/philippines-high-court-upholds-cybercrime-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] its Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012; which combats various online crimes such as hacking, identify theft, child pornography and libel. In April 2013, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/us-house-passes-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the controversial cybersecurity bill known as the <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-113hr624ih.pdf">Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act</a> (CISPA) [text, PDF] which was designed as a way to stop cyber attacks on US infrastructure as well as private companies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Cairo criminal court on Saturday sentenced former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges. However, Mubarak and his sons have already spent three years in prison for other convictions, so they will most likely not have to serve out this three year sentence. This corruption case was a retrial of the three men on charges of embezzlement. The original trial, which took place in May of last year and resulted in a three year sentence as well, <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/egypt-court-sentences-mubarak-to-3-years-for-embezzlement.php">found the men guilty</a> [JURIST report] of embezzling millions of dollars of public money by diverting public funds and using the money to upgrade family properties. Opposers of Mubarak argue the sentence is too short, as they believe that the courts' treatment of Mubarak during the time following his 30 year reign has been too lenient. Omar Ashour, a lecturer in Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/150509102401084.html">stated</a> [Aljazeera report] the following: "[w]hen we see the series of brutal abuses that happened under Mubarak in his 30-year reign, it will be seen as nothing, especially when we look at the trial happening now of former president Mohamed Morsi [...] it tells you that there is very high politicisation of the judiciary." </p>

<p>Mubarak and other members of his administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In January a court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/mubarak-fraud-conviction-overturned-dnp.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the May 2014 convictions of embezzlement for former president Mubarak and ordered a retrial. In December 2013 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/former-egypt-pm-sons-of-mubarak-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Egyptian prime minister and presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq and Alaa and Gamal Mubarak of charges of embezzling public funds. In August 2013 Mubarak appeared in court for his <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/mubarak-appears-in-court-for-retrial.php">retrial on complicity charges</a> [JURIST report] in the killing of more than 100 protesters during Egypt's 2011 uprising. The same week Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/mubarak-placed-under-house-arrest.php">released from prison and placed under house arrest</a> [JURIST report] at a military hospital after a court concluded that he served the maximum in time allowed in connection with the long-pending corruption case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] on Monday reviewed the US human rights record as part of its Universal Periodic Reviews, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/Highlights11May2015am.aspx">expressing concern</a> [press release] over excessive use of force by law enforcement, racial discrimination, and minority rights, particularly for African Americans. Participating nations recommended the US eliminate excessive use of force by police, work to ensure minority groups are fully guaranteed rights, and prevent racial profiling and discrimination in all forms, including by law enforcement. The US should also address the impact of violence that falls disproportionately on minority groups and low income persons. Some of the other issues raised during the review included surveillance and <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The council recommended the US ensure surveillance laws respect the right to privacy, and to close the facilities at Guantanamo. The US was recognized for positive achievements in regards to gay rights rights and access to health care. </p>

<p>UN recommendations to end excessive use of force and racial discrimination were handed down after several police killings of unarmed black men have increased racial tension in the country. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] on Friday announced the launch of a federal civil rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-attorney-general-announces-investigation-into-baltimore-police.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Baltimore's police. Earlier this month, the State's Attorney for Baltimore City charged <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-charged-in-freddie-gray-death.php">six police officers</a> [JURIST report] with crimes including murder and manslaughter over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. In January Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court declared a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury decided <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri police officer who last year shot and killed Micheal Brown, an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">AI reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also published a <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12254&ctl=Details&mid=15756&ItemID=38728&language=en-US">condemned</a> [press release] Sunday's suicide attack targeting a bus carrying civilian passengers working for the Attorney General's office. The attack killed five prosecutors and injured 19 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility, making this their twelfth attack in 2015 against legal professionals, killing a total of about 114 civilians. UNAMA stated that Afghanistan and the Taliban are bound by international humanitarian law, which forbids all attacks on civilians. </p>

<p>Afghanistan has been the target of much criticism regarding human rights issues. Last month UNAMA reported an increase in <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-reports-continued-increase-in-afghanistan-casualties.php">civilian casualties</a> [JURIST report] from ground engagements in Afghanistan compared to the same time last year, with indications that the number will continue to rise in the coming months. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported last month that Afghanistan women's rights activists are facing <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">increased violence</a> [JURIST report] and a lack of governmental support. UNAMA announced in February that Afghanistan has <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-reports-progress-toward-torture-prevention-in-afghanistan.php">made "some progress"</a> [JURIST report] toward preventing the torture of government detainees. Also in February UNAMA released a report indicating a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">22 percent increase in civilian causalities</a> [JURIST report] in 2014, making 2014 the deadliest year in Afghanistan since 2009. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-calls-for-protection-of-womens-rights-in-afghanistan.php">called on the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address violence against women in the country. UNAMA and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] released a study last February that raised concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">treatment of women</a> [JURIST report] in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://karnatakajudiciary.kar.nic.in/judgments.asp">High Court of Kanartaka</a> [official website], on Monday cleared former chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa Jayaram, of all corruption charges on appeal. In the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/world/asia/jayalalithaa-jayaram-tamil-nadu-corruption-appeal.html?_r=0">judgment</a> [NYT report], Justice CR Kumaraswamy wrote that the lower court ruling "suffer[ed] from infirmity, and is not sustainable law." Monday's decision will allow Jayaram to run in next year's election, possibly allowing her to return to office. Supporters of Jayaram called her conviction calamitous, and the prosecution expressed shock that it had been overturned.</p>

<p>After 18 years of litigation, Jayaram was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/india-court-convicts-top-official-for-corruption.php">convicted of corruption</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to four years in prison in September. She was found "guilty of amassing wealth disproportionate to known sources of her income." The sentence stripped Jayaram of her position as chief minister, as Indian law prohibits any politician from holding public office after being sentenced to more than two years in jail. Last year Indian <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/">President Pranab Mukherjee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/india-president-signs-anti-corruption-bill.php">signed into law </a>[JURIST report] a landmark anti-graft bill. The new law created a corruption ombudsman with extensive power to prosecute politicians and civil servants to create a "bribe-free India." In 2013 India's supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/india-supreme-court-rules-convicted-lawmakers-must-vacate-positions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that elected representatives convicted of serious crimes must immediately vacate their positions and be disqualified from future elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of UN human rights experts said Monday that the Government of Paraguy "<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">failed in its responsibility to act with due diligence</a>"  [press release] towards a 10-year-old girl who was raped and became pregnant. According to the experts, the girl has not been given treatments that could "save her life and preserve her health, including safe and therapeutic abortion in a timely manner." She is now 23 weeks pregnant, a result of "repeated sexual abuse," and unable to have an abortion as the abortion laws in Paraguay are "restrictive." The experts said that this is a violation of "rights to life, to health, and to physical and mental integrity of the girl as well as her right to education, jeopardising her economic and social opportunities." The experts also said that it is imperative that the alleged rapist be "duly prosecuted."</p>

<p>Abortion is a controversial issue among predominantly Roman Catholic Latin-American countries. In 2012 Uruguay's president signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uruguay-president-signs-bill-legalizing-abortion.php">legalizing abortion</a> [JURIST report] with certain exceptions. Also in 2012 the <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Brazilian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Portuguese] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/brazil-high-court-legalizes-abortion-of-brain-damaged-fetuses.php">overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report] against aborting brain-damaged fetuses. In March 2012 the <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Supreme Court of Argentina</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/argentina-supreme-court-legalizes-abortion-for-rape-victims.php">rape victims cannot be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] for seeking abortions. In 2011 <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Mexico's Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mexico-high-court-allows-state-anti-abortion-amendment.php">failed to overturn</a> [JURIST report] an amendment that stated life begins at conception, effectively banning abortions in Mexico's northern Baja California state. Guyana legalized abortion in 1995.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] officer Jeffrey Sterling was sentenced Monday to 42 months in prison after being convicted of telling <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/james_risen/index.html">New York Times journalist James Risen</a> [NY Times profile] about classified plans to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. In 2006 Risen published his book "State of War," in which he related details of a classified CIA plan to use a Russian intermediary, codenamed Merlin, to provide the Iranian government with flawed nuclear blueprints. Sterling was initially charged in 2010, but the government was never able to successfully compel Risen to divulge his informant, and Sterling was instead <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/former-cia-officer-convicted-of-espionage.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by a jury in January on a case built of mostly circumstantial evidence. Convicted in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] on nine counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information and other related charges, Sterling was facing up to 20 years jail time for the crime. Prosecutors say Sterling was motivated to leak the information as a result of his failed suit against the CIA for discrimination. </p>

<p>Sterling's prosecution is among many that the Obama administration has sought for the prevention of national security leaks. Last month <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Petraeus">General David Petraeus</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/david-petraeus-sentencing/">sentenced</a> [CNN report] to serve two years on probation and pay a $100,000 fine for leaking classified information to his biographer and lover Paula Broadwell. In August 2013 Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">sentenced to 35 years</a> in prison for his <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">disclosure</a> [JURIST reports] of classified information to the anti-secrecy organization Wikileaks. In June 2013 Edward Snowden, a former government employee and contractor, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with disclosing to newspaper reporters information about US intelligence activities that he obtained during the course of his work, raising significant <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the Espionage Act. In January of that year, John Kiriakou was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-cia-operative-sentenced-to-prison-for-disclosing-confidential-information.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two and a half years in prison for leaking an undercover officer's name to the media and for exposing parts of the CIA's torture strategies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mohamed Fahmy, an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/portal">Al Jazeera</a> [media website, in Arabic] journalist and Canadian national, announced plans on Monday to sue the network for negligence and seek USD $100 million in damages. Formerly a CNN journalist, Fahmy and two other Al Jazeera English journalists were convicted and sentenced by an Egyptian judge last year on charges of aiding terrorists and endangering national security for their roles in the coverage of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> movement that eventually ousted then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC reports]. Now facing retrial, Fahmy is suing Al Jazeera, alleging that the news organization was in fact a sponsor of the Muslim Brotherhood, and this connection negligently led to Fahmy being detained. </p>

<p>Despite Egypt's Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/retrial-for-three-al-jazeera-journalists-ordered-by-egypts-highest-court.php">overturning</a> [JURIST report] the lower court decision in February, the prosecution and subsequent imprisonment of the Al Jazeera journalists by the Egyptian government has garnered widespread criticism from international governments and rights groups. In March fellow Al Jazeera journalist and Australian national Peter Greste was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/jurist-political-conflict-in-egypt.php">released</a> [JURIST report] to Australia under a law allowing the deportation of foreign nationals to their home countries in such situations. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-sg-welcomes-egypt-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the decision by Egyptian authorities to release on bail Fahmy and fellow defendant Baher Mohamed while they await retrial. The three men were initially <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egyptian-authorities-detain-al-jazeera-journalists.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2013. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.hogstadomstolen.se">Swedish Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Swedish] on Monday rejected an appeal by <a href="https://wikileaks.org/index.en.html">WikiLeaks</a> [official website] founder <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/7909793/Profile-Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange.html">Julian Assange</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] seeking to overturn a 2010 arrest warrant for alleged sexual assault that was <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/swedish-appeals-court-reissues-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange.php">reissued</a> [JURIST report] by a lower court late last year. The warrant requires Assange to leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/swedish-appeals-court-reissues-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange.php">found asylum</a> [JURIST report] and travel to Sweden in order to be questioned about the allegations. Assange refuses to leave the embassy without a guarantee that he will not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges. In a 4-1 decision, the court allowed the arrest warrant to stand, as <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/julian-assange-to-be-questioned-by-swedish-prosecutors.php">accommodations</a> [JURIST report] had already been made to question Assange in London.</p>

<p>The <a href="/forum/2011/06/ashley-savage-whistleblowing.php">WikiLeaks trials</a> [JURIST op-ed] have garnered much debate in the US. Last year US Army Major General Jeffery Buchanan <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/army-general-denies-chelsea-mannings-request-for-clemency.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Private <a href="http://www.chelseamanning.org/learn-more/bradley-manning">Chelsea Manning's</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manning">news archive</a>] conviction and prison sentence for turning over classified information to WikiLeaks. In September 2013 Manning filed for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports] she received in August. The sentence came a month after she was found <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." In April 2013 the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. Earlier that year Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of 22 charges for providing classified materials to Wikileaks. In the same month the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] that argued for Manning's release based on a lack of a speedy trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report asserts that foreign nationals in Libya are subject to alarming rates of rape, torture and abduction, causing many to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea trying to escape. AI also noted that a recent upsurge in xenophobia has caused some of the abuses against religious minorities, namely Christians, who are subject to exploitation, torture and unlawful killings by armed groups enforcing a blighted version of Islamic law. In order to ameliorate the situation, AI called for the re-opening of neighboring borders and challenged the EU to investigate the human rights abuses, in addition to the search and rescue operations to which they have already committed themselves. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has seen the country besieged by violence and destruction. In April the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-condemn-airstrikes-on-libya-airport.php">strongly condemned</a> [JURIST report] the continuous airstrikes on the town of Zintan, noting a high danger to civilians. One moth earlier UNSMIL had warned the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] that the situation in Libya was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-deteriorating-rapidly.php">deteriorating</a> [JURIST report] and the country would likely become unstable without international intervention. Also in March the UN reported that armed groups in Libya deliberately <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-libya-armed-groups-attacking-human-rights-defenders.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] human rights defenders, killing, torturing and abducting the advocates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Ukranian Parliament on Tuesday approved controversial martial law regulations that will purportedly allow for extrajudicial detention and relocation of foreign citizens "who threaten or undertake aggression towards Ukraine." If enacted, the new law will also allow Ukrainian authorities to condemn private property and proscribe conduct and political parties that clash with the country's accepted notion of "independence." The law will likely <a href="http://rt.com/news/257893-ukraine-russia-martial-law/">affect</a> [RT report] a greater number of Russian citizens, as Parliament adopted a declaration in January naming Russia as an "aggressor state." The law will take effect if Parliament chooses to approve a similar measure introduced by the Ukrainian president.</p>

<p>Russia's ongoing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">conflict</a> [BBC timeline] with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ukraine">Ukraine</a> [JURIST news archive] has reinvigorated fears of Cold War Era politics and increased tensions between Russia and the West. In late February <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">US Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/john-kerry-says-us-considering-new-sanctions-against-russia.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Washington is considering "additional sanctions" against Russia in light of the most recent events in Ukraine. Also in late February a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-officials-voice-concern-over-ukraine-ceasefire.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that he had spoken with Ukraine Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin regarding the ceasefire in Ukraine. Ban expressed concern over the situation and informed Klimkin that the UN would continue to follow the Security Council's guidance. Earlier in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-escalated-fighting-in-ukraine.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] both sides of the Ukraine conflict to halt "the dangerous escalation in the fighting" in response to the human rights "situation in the east of the country." In January the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-death-toll-in-ukraine-exceeds-5000.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] saying that at least 5,086 people have been killed since the conflict in Ukraine began in April 2014, but expressed concerns that the real figure may be much higher.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Tuesday called for a rewrite of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF], including elimination of the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] phone data collection program. Obama's call follows a decision by the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that the Act does not authorize the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records. The president is <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/obama-calls-halting-nsa-phone-snooping-program-und/">urging Congress</a> [<em>Washington Times</em>] to adopt certain changes in an attempt to end such warrantless collections before June 1, when an important part of the Patriot Act is set to expire.</p>

<p>Obama's decision follows similar pleas from several US lawmakers, who in June 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the Lueneburg state court in Germany said the trial against a 93-year-old former Auschwitz guard can resume, finding him fit to stand trial. Oskar Gröening was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/accussed-nazi-officer-goes-on-trial-admits-moral-guilt.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces a maximum of 15 years in prison for processing the belongings of the victims and supporting the Nazi efforts economically. Last week the trial was canceled for a day after Gröening became sick. Judge Franz Kompisch <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3078332/The-Bookkeeper-Auschwitz-goes-trial-Former-Nazi-SS-guard-confiscated-Jews-money-valuables-deemed-fit-face-charges-murder-300-000-Jews.html">stated</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] that because of Gröening's age and health, trial sessions will last only three hours each day. The court heard <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11601127/British-Auschwitz-survivor-testifies-at-trial-of-Oskar-Groning.html">testimony</a> [Telegraph report] on Tuesday from a Holocaust survivor, Ivor Perl, who was 12 years old when he was sent to Auschwitz and lost his parents and seven siblings. The trial is scheduled to end in July.</p>

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of John Demjanjuk in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the Holocaust. In May 2013 German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man, Hans Lipschis, for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in mass murder. However, the court later found him <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/germany-court-rules-former-auschwitz-guard-unfit-for-trial.php">unfit</a> [JURIST report] to stand trial. Last June US officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/us-officials-arrest-accused-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] 89-year-old Johann Breyer on charges that he was a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during World War II after German authorities issued an arrest warrant and sought extradition. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mentally disabled prisoners experience "unnecessary, excessive, and even malicious force" at the hands of prison staff across the US, said a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/embargo/node/134859?signature=0875f8978618869a154d0dce56c50d20&suid=6">report</a> [text] released Tuesday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The report found excessive force used in many instances when prisoners exhibit behaviors that are characteristic of their mental illness and even when this behavior was not threatening. Some of the conduct by prison officials described by HRW include electric shocks, strapping prisoners to beds for days, second degree burns and using chemical sprays. Such force occurred most often in jails or prisons that were overcrowded, lacked rehabilitative and educational programs, or were in poor physical conditions. HRW is recommending, among other things, that federal, state and local governments enact legislation to ensure that facilities cooperate with mental health treatments and substance abuse treatments, reduce prison overcrowding and improve mental health services in prisons.</p>

<p>The treatment of prisoners and <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] has been a growing concern in the US for years. In April the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-excessive-force-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Kingsley v. Hendrickson</span> over the standard that should be applied to excessive-force claims brought by pre-trial detainees. A federal court in February <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arizona-reaches-settlement-in-prisoner-healthcare-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the <a href="https://corrections.az.gov/">Arizona Department of Corrections</a> (ADC) [official website] and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] in a class action lawsuit over the health care system within Arizona prisons. Also in February rights group <a href="http://equaljusticeunderlaw.org/">Equal Justice Under Law</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/missouri-towns-sued-over-debtors-prisons.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the cities of Ferguson and Jennings, Missouri, for their practice of jailing citizens who fail to pay debts owed to the city for minor offenses and traffic tickets. The ACLU and the <a href="http://www.aclutx.org/">ACLU of Texas</a> [advocacy website] released a report last June <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-cites-violations-in-privately-run-texas-prisons.php">exposing</a> [JURIST report] the results of a multi-year investigation into conditions at five Criminal Alien Requirement prisons in Texas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Eight supporters of former Egpytian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] were sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday for illegal protests and acts of violence committed in Cairo's eastern Al-Marg district in July 2014. The defendants allegedly chanted against the army and the police, in addition to damaging public areas and blocking the road in Al-Marg. After hearing the testimony of eyewitnesses, the prosecution accused the defendants of joining a terrorist organization, damaging public and private buildings, illegally protesting, and carrying weapons, among other things. Furthermore, the defendants allegedly protested <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/egypt-morsi-sentenced-150421063227546.html">against the death sentences</a> [Al Jazeera report] of 14 Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Al-Marg and Matariya. Two people were killed and four injured as a result of clashes between protestors and residents of the district. </p>

<p>Political tension in Egypt, including clashes between Morsi supporters and current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] has persisted <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">since the ouster</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of former president Morsi in 2013. Earlier this month an Egyptian court upheld death sentences for five members of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] on charges of killing policemen in 2013. In February four members of the Muslim Brotherhood were <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] for murder and possession of firearms. Also in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-retrial-for-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">ordered a retrial</a> [JURIST report] of 36 Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The 36 are among 183 supporters sentenced to death in June in connection with violence following Morsi's ouster. In January <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egypt-authorities-arrest-516-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">security forces arrested</a> [JURIST report] 516 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.pasen.gov/">Pennsylvania Senate</a> [official website] voted Tuesday to approve a <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2015&sInd=0&body=S&type=B&bn=0003">bill</a> [SB 3 materials] that could bring medical marijuana to the state. The bill will now head to the <a href="http://www.house.state.pa.us/">House</a> [official website] for consideration where proponents are optimistic it will have more success this year than the bill's predecessor last year. The 40-7 vote came following a brief discussion on the bill. Senators <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?id=991">Daylin Leach</a> and <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?id=1080">Mike Folmer</a> [official websites] the Senate Bill 3, which currently has 27 (15 Democrats and 12 Republicans) co-sponsors in both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature. Under the bill, home cultivation of marijuana would be prohibited, and medical marijuana products would be grown by licensed cultivation facilities, which would distribute through state-regulated dispensaries. The state-regulated dispensaries would be allowed to be run by both for-profit businesses and non-profit organizations. This bill is expected to fare better than last year's bill since some key Republicans in the House have expressed an interest in passing the bill, in addition to <a href="http://www.governor.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Tom Wolf</a> [official website], who has expressed support for reforming marijuana laws in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes has been a heated issue among a number of states in the US the past few years. In April Georgia Governor Nathan Deal <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/georgia-governor-legalizes-medical-marijuana.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana in the state of Georgia. Also in April the Arizona Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/arizona-top-court-rules-medical-marijuana-cannot-be-prohibited-for-parolees.php">ruled in two separate decisions</a> [JURIST report] that courts cannot prohibit parolees from using medical marijuana when used for medical purposes under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA). In March Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/colorado-asks-supreme-court-to-throw-out-marijuana-case.php">filed a brief urging</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to throw out a lawsuit by Nebraska and Oklahoma challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The director-general of UNESCO, <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/director-general/">Irina Bokova</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/director-general/singleview-dg/news/addressing_culture_under_threat_at_the_forefront_of_director_generals_visit_to_cairo/#.VVOm5EZefIV">continued</a> [press release] her campaign against the looting and destruction of archaeological sites in the Middle East at a conference in Cairo on Wednesday and condemned the destructive act as a "war crime." She declared the action a "tactic of war" and <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/559f65087629485395e2b0915c386876/ML--Egypt-Antiquities/">called for an end</a> [AP report] to the smuggling of antiquities in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya. The conference was held to address the increasing problem of looting and destruction of historical sites throughout the Middle East.</p>

<p>UNESCO has reiterated its commitment to provide more protection to end the looting and destruction of cultural heritage sites. The director-general also <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_director_general_calls_on_all_parties_to_protect_yemens_cultural_heritage/#.VVNp4PBnmSA">called on all parties</a> [press release] in Yemen to end the destructive attacks after reports of bombing of the World Heritage Site of the Old City of Sana'a.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Moscow court on Wednesday declined authorities' request to convert opposition activist <a href="https://navalny.com">Aleksei Navalny's</a> [personal website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=navalny">news archive</a>] suspended sentence into a prison term. Navalny is a Russian opposition activist and blogger who was given a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence after being convicted in December of fraud. Navalny is believed to have been one of the main actors behind the street protests in Moscow in 2011-12. Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service&#8212;supported by prosecutors&#8212;asked the court to send Navalny to jail for his disturbing the public order. The court, however, decided to extend Navalny's suspended sentence for three months, rather than replace the sentence with a prison term.</p>

<p>The Navalny brothers were <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20141230/272893824.html">charged</a> [RAPSI report] with embezzling approximately 30 million rubles (USD $518,000) from cosmetics company <a href="http://www.yvesrocherusa.com/control/main/">Yves Rocher Vostok</a> [corporate website] and the Multidisciplinary Processing Company (MPC) by a fraud scheme between 2008 and 2012. A spokesperson for the EU issued a <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2014/141230_3_en.htm">statement</a> [text] claiming that Navalny's trial was politically motivated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] on Wednesday urgently <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50846&Cr=burundi&Cr1=#.VVO286YXxFI">called</a> [press release] on all parties in Burundi to "exercise calm and restraint" amid reports of a coup taking place in the Burundian capital. The coup reportedly took place after President Pierre Nkurunziza left for a summit intended to resolve the crisis. With planned elections not far ahead in the country, tensions within Burundi were "simmering." Protest broke out, however, "after the country's ruling National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party nominated" Nkurunziza as its presidential candidate for a third term on April 26.</p>

<p>Although Burundi has recently adopted various treaties pledging respect for human rights, there have been a string of accusations against Burundi for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">committed</a> [JURIST report] at least 47 extrajudicial executions following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. Earlier that month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about freedom of expression in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine. In November the OHCHR reported that human rights activists in Burundi are <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/burundi-government-hounds-human-rights-activists.php">treated as political opponents</a> [JURIST report] by the state and subject to physical threats, anonymous phone calls, arbitrary arrests, assaults and judicial harassment. In June 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/burundi-passes-media-law-restricting-journalistic-freedom.php">Burundi lawmakers passed</a> [JURIST report] a media law that restricted journalistic freedom by limiting topics that can be reported and reducing the protection afforded to sources. The bill prohibited stories that could affect Burundi's "national unity; public order and security; morality and good conduct; honor and human dignity; national sovereignty; the privacy of individuals; the presumption of innocence" or issues involving "propaganda of the enemy of the Burundian nation in times of peace as of war" and "information that could affect the credit of the state and the national economy." In July 2010 Transparency International named [JURIST report] Burundi the most corrupt East-African nation with a corruption index of 36.7 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Dutch court on Wednesday cleared a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother to commit suicide. An important goal of the case was to set further precedents for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7322520.stm">assisted suicide in the Netherlands</a> [BBC backgrounder], a country where the act is already legal in certain situations. In 2008 Albert Heringa had been watching his mother suffer for quite some time. After giving her enough pills for a fatal dose and killing her, he was found guilty by a trial court, but received no punishment. The written judgment of the appeals court in overturning the decision <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/13/dutch-court-clears-man-who-helped-his-99-year-old-mother-die">stated</a> [AP report] that Heringa had to decide between following the law against assisted suicide and following his "unwritten moral duty" to give his mother "a painless, peaceful and dignified death." The law permits physicians to assist in suicides under strict conditions but does not allow friends or family members to do so. Fiona Zonneveld of the Dutch Association for Voluntary Euthanasia stated, "This is a step in the direction we want to go. ... Many people who consider their lives completed want to be helped by their loved ones. We think that should be allowed." Prosecutors will review the ruling to see if it should be appealed to a higher court, stating, "Assisting suicide according to the conditions laid out in the euthanasia law is and remains, in the view of the prosecution office, exclusively a task for a doctor."</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be a contentious legal issue around the world. In April a South African judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/terminally-ill-man-granted-right-to-die-in-south-africa.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a terminally ill man has a right to assisted suicide with no legal or professional consequences for the participating doctor. In February cancer patient Christie White and five physicians in California <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/california-suit-aims-to-permit-doctor-assisted-suicide.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in San Francisco County Superior Court challenging a state ban on physician-assisted suicide for mentally competent terminally ill patients. Also in February Colorado lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/colorado-refuses-to-pass-medically-assisted-suicide-bill.php">declined to pass a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have permitted medically assisted suicide for terminally-ill patients. In September 2014 a Belgian man serving a life sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/belgium-murderer-granted-right-to-be-euthanized.php">granted the right to be euthanized</a> [JURIST report] after spending the previous 30 years in prison.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bensouda stated, "[t]he international community must be more proactive in exploring solutions in order to tangibly help Libya restore stability and strengthen accountability for Rome Statute crimes." Bensouda urged the Security Council to call on neighboring member states to aide the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website]. Bensouda also said she would continue to work with UNSMIL to gather further evidence to bring justice for international law violations in Libya. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has seen the country besieged by violence and destruction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.trackingterrorism.org/article/ugandas-rising-threat-allied-democratic-forces-adf">Allied Democratic Forces</a> (ADF) [TRAC backgrounder] committed "grave violations of international humanitarian law" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the end of 2014, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CD/ReportMonusco_OHCHR_May2015_EN.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15952&LangID=E">press release</a>] Wednesday. The report claims that the ADF, a Ugandan rebel group, has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Beni territory of the North Kivu province during a three-month period at the end of last year. It is estimated that the ADF have attacked 35 villages, resulting in 237 civilians killed and 47 wounded. UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the DRC Martin Kobler said, "[i]n light of the magnitude and the persistence of the attacks by ADF combatants, I call upon the Congolese authorities to take, as soon as possible, all the necessary measures to put an end to the massacres of civilians."</p>

<p>The DRC has been the site of considerable human rights abuses committed by both government forces and various rebel groups. In December the International Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/icc-upholds-lubanga-conviction.php">upheld the conviction</a> [JURIST report] and 14-year prison sentence of former DRC militia leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6131516.stm">Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> [BBC profile]. Lubanga was <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/congo-militia-leader-found-guilty-in-landmark-first-icc-verdict.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] in March 2012 for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in hostilities. In November Human Rights Watch released a report accusing police officers in the DRC of <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/hrw-reports-police-involvement-in-executions-and-disappearances-of-youths-in-the-dr-congo.php">executing</a> [JURIST report] 51 youths and causing the disappearance of 33 others. The UN issued a <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-report-finds-violations-in-dr-congo.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in October that addressed the human rights violations taking place in connection with Operation Likofi. In July the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict presented a report outlining the situation of the child in the DRC, which found the <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/recruitment-of-child-soldiers-persists-in-drc-un-report.php">recruitment of child soldiers</a> [JURIST report] persists. In June the head of the UN Mission in the DRC strongly <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-calls-for-immediate-end-to-conflict-in-drc.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] an outbreak of deadly violence in the eastern areas of the DRC, sparked by a confrontation over cattle.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] on Tuesday released a set of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM446580.pdf">proposed guidelines</a> [text, PDF] outlining a plan to end the national lifetime ban on blood donations from homosexual individuals. The ban, which many activists and medical groups say after 32 years in no longer justified, was enacted to prevent donations from donors at an increased risk of carrying HIV. The proposal suggests, among other things, that donations would be barred from male individuals who have engaged in sexual activity with another male within the previous year. Other countries including Australia, Japan and the UK have adopted similar measures in recent years. Many medical experts have stated that the lifetime ban is no longer supported by science. Gay activists claim that although the policy shift is progress in the right direction, the one-year deferral period still has the potential to stigmatize the homosexual community. David Stacy of the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BLOOD_DONATIONS_GAYS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">stated</a> [AP report], "This policy prevents men from donating life-saving blood based solely on their sexual orientation rather than actual risk to the blood supply." </p>

<p>Bans on blood donations from homosexual individuals garner much debate. In April the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ecj-rules-to-ease-lifetime-ban-against-blood-donation-from-homosexuals.php">restricted</a> [JURIST report] bans on blood donations from homosexual men. Rather than instilling a blanket ban over the blood donations of all homosexual men, the ECJ stated that acceptance of donations should be determined on an individual basis. The court suggested that questionnaires and individual interviews with donors should be instituted in effort to weed out those with "high-risk sexual behaviour." In 2013 a Northern Ireland judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/ireland-ban-on-homosexual-blood-donation-ruled-irrational.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Health Minister Edwin Poots could not continue to enforce the lifetime ban on gay men donating blood, calling the law "irrational." In September 2011 the UK Department of Health announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-lifts-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-men.php">lift the lifetime ban</a> [JURIST report] on blood donations from men who have had sex with other men. In September 2010 an Ontario Superior Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-upholds-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Canadian Blood Services (CBS) is justified in prohibiting sexually active gay males from donating blood on the grounds that the CBS discriminates on the basis of health and safety considerations rather than on sexual orientation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/china0515_ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [PDF] Wednesday detailing the continued abuse of criminal suspects by Chinese police. The interviewed detainees reported instances of torture, including being shackled to a "tiger chair" for days and being hung by the wrists. Despite detention reforms in China, including making evidence obtained through torture inadmissible, the interviewed detainees and lawyers reported that police officers sometimes used torture techniques that left no visible harm. In other cases with clear evidence of torture, it was reported that judges did not implement the "exclusionary rule" and allowed evidence obtained through torture to be used at trial. The report includes a statement from both a former judge and former police officer declaring the supervision over criminal interrogations inadequate.     </p>

<p>The use of torture on criminal suspects to extract confessions in China has been under heavy scrutiny in recent years. In November 2013 China's <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People's Court</a> [official website, in Mandarin] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/china-top-court-bans-use-of-forced-confessions.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] the use of forced confessions extracted through torture. The court found that illegal methods of confession extraction, including food and sleep deprivation and temperature manipulation are unacceptable and amount to torture. This ruling was part of a broad move by the Communist Party of China (CPC) to reform the nation's human rights situation. In 2005 a UN human rights investigator <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/torture-in-china-still-widespread-un.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that torture in the country was declining but still widespread. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Republican led <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/">Missouri General Assembly</a> [official website] on Wednesday approved a "right to work" bill that would stop workers from being required to be part of a union or pay dues, but the bill did not garner enough votes to overcome a likely veto by <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website]. After a more than eight-hour filibuster by democrats, the Missouri House of Representatives approved the measure by a 92-66 vote. The Missouri Senate passed the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 21-13. The bill needed to have passed by a two-thirds majority in both chambers in order to overcome any upcoming veto. The Republican backers of the bill claim that the measure would encourage economic growth and bring more businesses to the state. Nixon claims the legislation will weaken the state's economy.</p>

<p>Missouri would be the twenty-sixth state to enact such a law. In March the Wisconsin AFL-CIO and two local labor unions <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/wisconsin-unions-file-first-lawsuit-against-new-right-to-work-law-dnp.php">filed the first lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's newly enacted "right to work" law. In November the Indiana Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/indiana-supreme-court-upholds-states-right-to-work-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's right-to-work law, stating it did not violate the state's constitution. <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/michigan-appeals-court-rules-right-to-work-law-applies-to-state-employees.php">Michigan</a> [JURIST report] and Illinois have also received challenges to their right to work laws. JURIST Guest Columnist Karla Swift of the Michigan State AFL-CIO <a href="/hotline/2013/03/karla-swift-michigan-right-to-work.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the "right to work" laws enacted by the Michigan Legislature in 2012 are unconstitutional and were enacted in violation of Michigan's Open Meeting Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] on Thursday rejected the Canadian government's bid to have former Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+khadr">Omar Khadr</a> [JURIST news archive] declared an adult offender. The case concerned whether the eight-year war crimes sentence Khadr received from a US military commission in 2010 should be interpreted as a youth or adult sentence. Nine Supreme Court justices rejected the federal government's conclusion that Khadr received five concurrent eight-year terms. Chief Justice <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/judges-juges/bio-eng.aspx?id=beverley-mclachlin">Beverley McLachlin</a> [official website] confirmed the <a href="https://albertacourts.ca/court-of-appeal">Alberta Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision that Khadr's sentence should be served in a provincial facility and ordered that the appeal be dismissed. Khadr, 28, is a Canadian citizen who was captured by US forces at the age of 15 after he was found fighting in Afghanistan in 2002 as a child soldier. He spent eight years in Guantanamo before being convicted on five charges and sentenced to eight years in prison for war crimes. The US <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-khadr-to-canada.php">transferred Khadr</a> [JURIST report] to Canada in 2012.</p>

<p>The US military <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">prison of Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an area of controversy for several years. In May the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] said that by <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-canadas-release-of-child-soldier-is-a-significant-step.php">releasing Omar Khadr on bail</a> [JURIST report], Canada was taking a "significant step toward ending his ordeal." The HRW urged the Canadian government to rehabilitate Khadr and assist his integration into society. In April a US government source revealed that Shaker Aamer, a Saudi citizen and former UK resident detained at Guantanamo Bay, is <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/guantanamo-detainee-set-to-be-released-in-june.php">expected to be released</a> [JURIST report] in June after recent calls from the UK government. In February the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pentagon-announces-retraction-of-military-judge-relocation-rule.php">overturned a rule</a> [JURIST report] that sought to speed up the litigation process of military commission prosecutions by requiring judges to relocate to Guantanamo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d114:h.r.00036:">bill</a> [HR 36] on Wednesday that would ban most abortion after 20 weeks, despite strong opposition from the White House. The Republican-led House approved the bill by a margin of 242-184. House Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://goodlatte.house.gov/">Bob Goodlatte</a> [official website] called the vote "a victory for the most innocent and defenseless among us, our children." The bill, officially titled the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. The <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] called the bill "cruel and unconstitutional," adding that it included exceptions only for women who are rape survivors and have received medical care or counseling at least 48 hours prior to seeking an abortion, minors who report rape or incest to law enforcement or child protection agencies, and women with life-threatening conditions. </p>

<p>Abortion has been a heated topic of discussion in recent years. Earlier this month Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a bill into law <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/oklahoma-governor-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period.php">extending the mandatory waiting period</a> [JURIST report] for women seeking an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. In April Tennessee lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/tennessee-lawmakers-approve-abortion-restriction-measures.php">approved two measures</a> [JURIST report] that, if signed into law, will require state abortion clinics to be licensed as surgical centers and require women to wait 48 hours after receiving counseling before being able to get an abortion. Also in April Kansas Governor Sam Brownback <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/kansas-governor-signs-bill-banning-second-trimester-abortion-procedure.php">signed a bill </a> [JURIST report] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Wednesday approves the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3361">USA Freedom Act</a> [text], which would end the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency's</a> (NSA) [official website] mass collection of Americans' phone data. The measure, approved by a vote of 338 to 88, largely extends the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">USA Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF] that was set to expire on June 3. Under the measure the NSA can no longer collect phone data of American citizens in bulk, but the government can still access this data through the records of major telecommunication companies such as Verizon or AT&T. Lawmakers demonstrated strong bipartisan support in the House, but it is unlikely that such support will be reflected in the Senate. <a href="http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/">Senator Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) has said he wants no change while <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/">Senator Rand Paul</a> (R-KY) [official websites] is pushing for even greater restrictions of data collection. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">White House is supportive</a> [JURIST report] of the bill and has called for the elimination of phone data collection. A compromise must be reached in the Senate by June 1 before the provision in the Patriot Act regarding NSA data collection expires.</p>

<p>Several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/hilite/">ruled </a>[opinion, PDF] earlier this month that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">Patriot Act does not authorize</a> [JURIST report] the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Serbian court on Thursday politically rehabilitated a World War II royalist executed nearly 70 years ago on convictions of collaborating with Nazis. Serbian nationalist Dragoljub "Draza" Mihailovic was an officer of the royal army when the Nazis invaded. Mihailovic allegedly began collaborating with the invaders and joined with them against their common enemy, communist <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/josip_broz_tito/index.html">Josip Broz Tito</a> [NYT backgrounder]. After Tito prevailed over them in 1946, Mihailovic was convicted of collaboration with Nazis and committing war crimes. He was secretly executed and buried in an unknown location. In 2010 Mihailovic's grandson petitioned the courts to rehabilitate him, claiming that his grandfather had actually been fighting both Nazis and communists while waiting for Allies to rise up against the Germans. The judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/14/us-serbia-court-wwii-idUSKBN0NZ1DY20150514">agreed</a> [Reuters report], finding that the case against Mihailovic was politically motivated. The neighboring country of Croatia call the ruling an outrage.</p>

<p>Nazis and their supporters have continued to be prosecuted regardless of their age. In February a German court said that a 93-year-old man dubbed the "accountant of Auschwitz" <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/accused-nazi-officer-to-stand-trial-for-mass-killings.php">will stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he was an accessory to the killing of 300,000 people. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/germany-court-dismisses-case-against-former-nazi-solider.php">threw out a case</a> [JURIST report] against a former SS soldier who was accused of being involved in the largest massacre in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. In June US officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/us-officials-arrest-accused-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] 89-year-old Johann Breyer on charges that he was a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during World War II. In January 2014 a judge for Germany's Hagen State Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/germany-court-drops-case-against-92-year-old-former-nazi.php">dropped the case</a> [JURIST report] against 92-year-old Siert Bruins, a former member of the Nazi Waffen SS. Prosecutors had accused Bruins of executing captured Dutch Nazi-opposition fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 outside the town of Appingedam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Burundi authorities arrested several military generals Friday after an unsuccessful coup attempt and said the suspects will face a military court for mutiny charges. Maj. Gen. Godefroid Niyombare <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/15/africa/burundi-coup-leaders-arrested/">announced</a> [CNN report] the coup on Wednesday. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13085065">President Pierre Nkurunziza</a> [BBC profile] was in Tanzania at the time the coup was announced but is believed to be back in his country. In Bujumbura, troops supporting the president and those supporting Niyombare fought on the streets Wednesday and Thursday. Following the announcement, the airport in Bujumbura and the land borders were closed, but the streets reportedly <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/15/burundi-coup-apparently-fails-as-president-is-said-to-return">calmed</a> [AP report] down Friday. </p>

<p>Burundi has faced unrest since Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in April, and the unrest intensified after the Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that he could <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">seek a third term</a> [JURIST report] in office without violating the country's constitution, which states that presidents shall be universally elected into office for a term of five years and can renew the term once. Burundi authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-police-arrest-opposition-leader-for-meeting-with-african-delegates.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] political opposition leader Audifax Ndabitoreye in May shortly after he met with <a href="http://www.eac.int/">East African Community</a> [official website] ministers in the capital city of Bujumbura. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] over actions by Burundian authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections. The OHCHR said last month that the upcoming elections in Burundi place the nation at a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">critical moment in history</a> [JURIST report], urging the nation to choose democracy in the elections. Burundi has also been criticized for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police committed at least 47 <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">extrajudicial executions</a> [JURIST report] following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. Earlier that month, the OHCHR expressed concerns about <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-serious-concerns-about-freedom-of-expression-in-burundi.php">freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report] in Burundi following the arrest of Bob Rugurika, director of Radio Public Africaine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Polish government on Friday processed payments to two terror suspects currently held by the US at Guantanamo Bay. The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] had imposed a Saturday <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_POLAND_PAYING_TERROR_SUSPECTS?SITE=MOSTP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-05-15-06-06-56">deadline</a> [AP report] on Poland to make the reparations. Last July Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were awarded USD $147,000 and $113,000, respectively, in a lawsuit against Poland for allowing the CIA to detain them and for not preventing torture and inhumane treatment. The court also ordered Poland to urge the US not to execute the suspects. Many people in Poland are upset with the penalty, feeling they must pay for US actions, and many Americans are upset at the idea that possible terror suspects could receive this money. The detainees' lawyer, however, claims there rights were violated, they were subjected to torture, and they have never been found guilty of a crime in court.</p>

<p>The US military prison at <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued to generate controversy. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="https://albertacourts.ca/court-of-appeal">Alberta Court of Appeal</a> [official website] ruled that former Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr can be <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/canada-court-rules-khadr-may-be-released-on-bail.php">released</a> [JURIST report] on bail while he appeals his US war crimes conviction. In February the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pentagon-announces-retraction-of-military-judge-relocation-rule.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a rule that would have attempted to speed up the litigation process in military commission prosecutions by requiring judges to relocate to Guantanamo. In January a group of US senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/senators-propose-legislation-to-halt-release-transfers-of-guantanamo-inmates.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would place a moratorium on the releases or transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo. Also in January a lawyer for former Guantanamo detainee David Hicks said the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-government-admits-former-guantanamo-detainee-wrongfully-convicted-lawyer.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] the conviction was incorrect and did not dispute Hicks' innocence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese prosecutors on Friday said that prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang has officially been indicted on charges of fanning ethnic hatred and provoking trouble for comments that he posted online. He has already been detained for one year. A more severe charge of inciting divisions and a charge of illegally obtaining personal information were <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/15/china-charges-pu-zhiquang-with-provoking-trouble.html">dropped</a> [Al Jazeera and AP report] by prosecutors. In a statement the Beijing prosecutors' office said that the human rights lawyer should face criminal prosecution for comments he made on social media and his microblog, which has since been shut down by authorities, that they view as a disruption of social order. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a>[official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/05/241956.htm">urged</a> [press statement] Chinese authorities to release Pu earlier this month and respect his rights in accordance with the country's international human rights commitments, but China refused to release him. According to one of Pu's lawyers, the charges <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/world/asia/china-pu-zhiqiang-trial.html?rref=world/asia&module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&action=keypress&region=FixedLeft&pgtype=article">could result</a> [NYT report] in a maximum sentence of 10 years, though it is unlikely that such a sentence will be imposed. Pu continues to reject the charges and maintain his innocence, asserting that the case is baseless and politically motivated. </p>

<p>Pu was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/china-detains-rights-lawyer-ahead-of-tiananmen-square-anniversary.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] last May on a charge of "causing a disturbance" after he attended a weekend meeting that urged an investigation into the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. In June a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/china-court-denies-bail-to-human-rights-lawyer.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] him bail. The Tiananmen protests began in April 1989 with mainly students and laborers protesting the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government declared martial law in May and initiated the violent dispersal of protesters by the People's Liberation Army on June 4. The Chinese government has never publicized official figures, but the Hong Kong-based <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/">Information Center for Human Rights & Democracy</a> [advocacy website] reported last year that unnamed sources had <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/main/messages/16647.html">estimated 600 people were killed</a> [ICHR report, in Chinese]. In 2012 Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">detained hundreds of activists</a> [JURIST report] in Beijing marking the twenty-third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. In 2011 the US State Department urged the Chinese government to release protesters arrested for peaceful protests in the square in 1989. Human rights and democracy advocates in 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-advocates-urge-reform-on-20th.php">called on the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the 1989 uprising, provide an accurate count of those killed in the government's response to the uprising, and to accept reform outlines set forth in the Charter 08 proposal. In August 2008 Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/china-releases-political-activist-after.php">released</a> [JURIST report] activist<a href="http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/1820/prmID/172"> Hu Shigen</a> [profile], sentenced to 20 years in prison for carrying out counterrevolutionary propaganda, including organizing events commemorating the uprising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chechen immigrant <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31734557">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Dzhokhar+Tsarnaev+">news archive</a>] was sentenced to death by lethal injection on Friday by a federal jury for his role in the April 2013 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/us/boston-marathon-terror-attack-fast-facts/">Boston Marathon bombings</a> [CNN backgrounder] after 14 hours of deliberations. He will be formally sentenced at a hearing within weeks, during which victims will be able to address him and give impact statements. The attack, supposedly meant to punish America for perceived harm against Muslims, was perpetrated by Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who together placed two pressure-cooker explosive in the crowd near the finish line. While Tsarnaev's defense team <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/15/us/boston-bombing-tsarnaev-sentence/">admitted</a> [CNN report] at trial that he had played a role in the attacks, it asserted that it was his older brother Tamerlan that was the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32757790">main force</a> [BBC report] behind the attack with defense attorney Judy Clarke stating that the crimes would not have been committed if not for Tamerlan. US Attorney General <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">Loretta Lynch</a> [official profile] called the death penalty a fitting punishment for the crimes committed, saying she hopes that the completion of the prosecution will "bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families." </p>

<p>Tsarnaev was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-convicted-in-boston-marathon-bombing-case.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in April on <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/training/pdf/BlankVerdictSlip.pdf">30 federal charges</a> [verdict slip, PDF] relating to the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The Boston Marathon bombing trial began in early March after a number of delays. Earlier that month the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/federal-appeals-court-rejects-motion-to-move-boston-marathon-bombing-trial.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by Tsarnaev to move the trial out of Boston. In January a judge for the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/judge-rejects-plea-for-delay-in-boston-bombing-trial.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a plea by lawyers for Tsarnaev to pause jury selection for his trial due to the attacks in Paris. The judge, in a short ruling, noted that he had given potential jurors a questionnaire to asses whether an impartial jury could be chosen in this case. Earlier in January the jury selection <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/jury-selection-begins-for-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect.php">began</a> [JURIST report] with more than 1,200 potential jurors being called to the federal courthouse for consideration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced ex-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi+">news archive</a>] and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. The prison break occurred during the country's <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile]. Morsi was accused of conspiring with foreign militants to free Islamists during the mass prison breaks. The case was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32763215">referred</a> [BBC report] by Judge Shaaban el-Shami to the nation's top Muslim theologian for his non-binding opinion on whether the sentences should stand, as is customary for all death sentences in Egypt. Co-founder of the <a href="http://www.fjponline.com/">Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party</a> [official website] and Cabinet minister under Morsi Amr Darrag <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/court-sentences-egypts-ousted-president-death-092410985.html">denounced</a> [AP report] the verdict, saying that Saturday would be "remembered as one of the darkest days in Egypt history." <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] also <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/05/egypt-court-recommends-death-sentences-for-morsi-more-than-100-others/">spoke against the verdict</a> [AI report], calling for a retrial and stating that all evidence gathered against the former president and his co-defendants was inadmissible as a result of their illegal detention before trial. </p>

<p>The Muslim Brotherhood has been facing legal challenges, particularly in Egypt. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/morsi-goes-on-trial-over-espionage-allegations.php">put Morsi on trial</a> [JURIST report] over accusations of spying and leaking information to Qatar.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A top Osama bin Laden aide was sentenced Friday to life in prison for conspiring with other al Qaeda members in the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa. A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] rejected Khaled al-Fawwaz's claims that he is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/osama-bin-laden-aide-embassy-bombings">not a violent man</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Prosecutors said Fawwaz was an al Qaeda leader and director of a military camp in Afghanistan. He was supposed to stand trial for the bombings with Abu Anas al-Libi, but <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-embassy-bombing-suspect-dies-in-hospital.php">Libi passed away</a> [JURIST report] in January. The attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and left more than 1,000 people injured. </p>

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda operatives are making their way through the US judicial system. In June the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/pentagon-approves-war-crimes-trial-for-al-qaeda-leader.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the war crimes trial of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6601087.stm">Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi</a> [BBC profile], a former leader of al Qaeda's army between 2002 and 2004, <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ChargingDocumentsAbdalHadialIraqi20131.pdf">accused</a> [charge sheet, PDF] of killing US service members and funding al Qaeda operations amongst other things. In March 2013 Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of bin Laden, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] and thereafter indicted in federal court for plotting to kill Americans. In January 2013 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the conspiracy <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, Osama bin Laden's media secretary. In October 2012 Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges, including taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups and conspiracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Supreme Court of Mexico</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Friday <a href="http://www2.scjn.gob.mx/red2/comunicados/noticia.asp?id=3088">ordered</a> [press release, in Spanish] a school and teacher to compensate a student for their role in bullying, ruling that the teacher encouraged it. The private school, known as Universal Truth and Science Institute, and the teacher have been ordered to pay the seven-year-old victim 550,000 pesos or USD $35,000. The total includes tuition, costs for the trial and psychological treatments for the child. The court found that the teacher not only encouraged the abuse by the other children but also participated in it. The court further found that the child was studying in a hostile environment and the school did nothing to protect the child. "More than a warning, this is an invitation to schools that they understand that this phenomenon cannot be tolerated, and in a case where no measures are taken against it, there has to be a responsibility and a consequence," said Justice Arturo Zaldívar Lelo de Larrea. "The private educational institutions are not just a business." </p>

<p>Bullying is an increasingly important issue across the globe. In June 2013 Japanese lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-lawmakers-approve-anti-bullying-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] anti-bullying legislation. In 2011 US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/constituentservices/colorado-flood-information.htm">Representative Jared Polis</a> and <a href="http://www.franken.senate.gov">Senator Al Franken</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students in federally funded public elementary and high schools from bullying. The <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2011/03/KIN11099.pdf">Student Non-Discrimination Act</a> (SNDA) [text, PDF] was reintroduced in both the <a href="http://www.house.gov">US House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senate</a> [official websites] prompted by the suicides resulting from anti-LGBT bullying of numerous students in the US. The legislation, however, failed to make it out of committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egyptian authorities on Sunday executed six men convicted by a military court of killing two Egyptian soldiers. The men were convicted of killing the soldiers after an hour-long gunfight outside a bomb factory in Cairo. The men were also convicted of belonging to Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which is said to have pledged its allegiance to the Islamic State group. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/document/?indexNumber=mde12%2F1420%2F2015&language=en">Amnesty International</a> [AI report] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/04/egypt-halt-executions-six-men">Human Rights Watch</a> [HRW report] had called for a retrial for at least half of the men, claiming they were held in secret at the time the crime was committed and therefore could not be responsible for the attack. The scattered attacks have caused a great deal of uproar in Egypt and have led to questionable convictions and executions. Just after the ex-president's death sentence on Saturday, three judges were gunned down. Officials also stated that Saturday a bomb exploded outside a courthouse in the southern city of Assiut, injuring a police officer.</p>

<p>On Saturday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] ex-president Mohammed Morsi and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/morsi-goes-on-trial-over-espionage-allegations.php">put Morsi on trial</a> [JURIST report] over accusations of spying and leaking information to Qatar. Earlier in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] on bail of two Al Jazeera journalists being retried on terror charges. Baher Mohammed and Mohammed Fahmy had spent more than 400 days in jail after a court found them guilty for falsifying news reports and associating with the Muslim Brotherhood. Also that month a court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">confirmed death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 183 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted president Morsi. In October an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/egypt-jails-muslim-brotherhood-leaders-for-15-years-over-lawyers-torture.php">jailed eight men</a> [JURIST report], including two Muslim Brotherhood leaders, for 15 years over the torture of a lawyer during 2011 uprisings against former president Hosni Mubarak. In June a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-outraged-over-egypt-mass-death-sentences.php">expressed their anger</a> [JURIST report] after an Egyptian court confirmed the death sentences of 183 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN human rights chief on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15960&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Southeast Asian governments to take action to protect the lives of migrants in difficult maritime situations and not turn away incoming migrant boats. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] said that he is "appalled" at reports of these countries pushing these boats back out to sea, leading to many "avoidable deaths." Although Zeid did commend Indonesia and Malaysia for disembarking 582 and 1,018 people, respectively, last weekend, he said that the policy of "pushbacks" was both "incomprehensible and inhumane." He noted:<blockquote>Governments in South-East Asia need to respond to this crisis from the premise that migrants, regardless of their legal status, how they arrive at borders, or where they come from, are people with rights that must be upheld. Criminalising such vulnerable people, including children, and placing them in detention is not the solution.</blockquote>It is believed that approximately 6,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants remain stranded at sea. In discussing the root causes of the problem, Zeid stressed the serious human rights situation in Myanmar. "Until the Myanmar Government addresses the institutional discrimination against the Rohingya population, including equal access to citizenship, this precarious migration will continue," he said. </p>

<p>Mass migrations have been occurring in Europe as well as Southeast Asia. Refuges from the conflicts in the Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. Also in April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the EU's failure to prevent migrant casualties at sea. The statement came amid reports that as many as 300 migrants had died off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/">New Hampshire Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday struck down a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In its decision to uphold the lower court ruling, the court stated that the law that essentially required voters to acquire a driver's license in New Hampshire was unconstitutional and could potentially discourage people from voting. The court noted that the language of the law is confusing and inaccurate, potentially causing voter confusion and therefore placing too high a burden on the essential right to vote. The law was enacted in 2012 when the legislature passed <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/SB0318.html">SB 318</a> [text] requiring voters to sign an affidavit that they were subject to state residency laws, including signing up for a driver's license. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] argued that the language was too confusing and wrongly required the voter to intend to remain living in the state for the indefinite future. The group argued that such a restriction could prevent people such as college students from voting. The court rejected the state's argument that the law was enacted to comply with the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx">Help America Vote Act</a> [EAC backgrounder]. </p>

<p>Voting rights have been a contentious issue in the US recently. In March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lets-wisconsin-voter-id-law-stand.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Frank v. Walker</span>, allowing Wisconsin's voter identification law to stand. Wisconsin's Act 23, which requires residents to present photo ID to vote, was <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">struck down</a> by a federal district court, but <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-voter-id-law-in-wisconsin.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST reports] by the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in September. Also in March Oregon Governor Kate Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">signed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. In November a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form. Also in November Illinois voters <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/illinois-voters-approve-voter-anti-discrimination-amendment.php">approved the Illinois Right to Vote Amendment</a> [JURIST report] which bans all voter discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or income.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-485_o7jp.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/comptroller-v-wynne/">Comptroller v. Wynne</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Maryland's personal income tax scheme violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">dormant Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The question before the court was whether the US Constitution prohibits a state from taxing all the income of its residents&#8212;wherever earned&#8212;by mandating a credit for taxes paid on income earned in other states. Maryland allows such a credit against its state income tax but not against its local county taxes. The Maryland Court of Appeals <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10717974704422802321&amp;q=MARYLAND+STATE+COMPTROLLER+OF+THE+TREASURY+v.+BRIAN+WYNNE,+ET+UX.+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">ruled</a> [opinion] this practice unconstitutional, and the state appealed. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court affirmed:<blockquote>We have long held that States cannot subject corporate income to tax schemes similar to Maryland's, and we see no reason why income earned by individuals should be treated less favorably. Maryland admits that its law has the same economic effect as a state tariff, the quintessential evil targeted by the dormant Commerce Clause. We therefore affirm the decision of Maryland's highest court and hold that this feature of the State's tax scheme violates the Federal Constitution.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined in part by Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas also filed a separate dissent, joined in part by Scalia. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Scalia and Justice Elena Kagan.</p>

<p>Maryland taxed the income earned by its residents both inside and outside the state. However, Maryland does not offer residents a full credit against income tax paid to other states, resulting in some of the residents' income being taxed twice. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-maryland-income-tax-case.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case last May and <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-redistricting.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Edison International</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the timeliness of an <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/erisa.htm">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974</a> (ERISA) [DOL backgrounder] fiduciary duty claim over investments does not necessarily run from initial selection of investments. The fiduciaries in this case offered higher-cost retail class mutual funds to plan participants, even though identical lower-cost institution class funds were available. Plan participants from Edison International selected the retail mutual funds as plan elections more than six years before the claim was filed, which is beyond the reach of ERISA's statute of limitations. In an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court concluded that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit "erred by applying a statutory bar to a claim of a 'breach or violation' of a fiduciary duty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty." The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French court on Monday cleared two police officers accused in the 2005 deaths of two teenagers outside Paris that sparked <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=france+riots">weeks of riots</a> [JURIST news archive] throughout the country. The court in Rennes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/18/world/europe/ap-eu-france-suburban-riots.html?_r=0">ruled</a> [AP report] that officers Sebastien Gaillemin and Stephanie Klein were not responsible for the deaths of 15-year-old Bouna Traore and 17-year-old Zyed Benna that occurred in October 2005 when they were chased by police, entered a power substation to hide and were fatally electrocuted. After three weeks of rioting and thousands of arrests, a state of emergency was declared and a curfew was imposed. Gaillemin and Klein were accused of failing to assist someone in danger and were facing up to five years in prison. While the victims' families argued that the lives of the boys could have been saved by the officers, who knew the boys were in potential danger, the officers insisted that were not to blame. The court determined that neither of the officers had a "clear awareness of grave and imminent danger" as required by French law. </p>

<p>There are now fears that the verdict may lead to violent protests similar to those seen recently in the US. Several groups in France's suburbs have already planned for gatherings on Monday after the verdict. The deaths of the teens exposed deep-seated tensions in France's poor suburbs, where neighborhoods of immigrants feel alienated from French society, and scores of Muslim and black youths commonly clash with police. In 2005, as the riots spread to poor immigrant neighborhoods around the country, the French government <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/french-parliament-approves-extension.php">authorized emergency powers</a> [JURIST report] for local governments struggling to control the violence. The state of emergency was finally <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/france-ends-state-of-emergency-imposed.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] in January 2006. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1333_g31h.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/coleman-bey-v-tollefson/">Coleman v. Tollefson</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a dismissal of a prisoner's lawsuit that is still appealable does count as one of three allotted "strikes" that limits other suits by the prisoner. The "three-strike" provision of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1915">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a> [text] bars an inmate from filing a new lawsuit over prison conditions after three prior lawsuits had failed on the grounds of lack of merit. The question was whether a dismissal on one of the statutorily enumerated grounds of the federal law in question counts as one of those three strikes. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/13a0303p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a dismissal counts as one of the three strikes, even if the dismissal is the subject of an ongoing appeal. In an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court affirmed:<blockquote>We recognize that our interpretation of the statute may create a different risk: An erroneous trial court dismissal might wrongly deprive a prisoner of in forma pauperis status with respect to lawsuits filed after a dismissal but before its reversal on appeal. But that risk does not seem great.</blockquote>The court concluded that the plain language of the statute dictated the result of the case.</p>

<p>In 2010 Andre Lee Coleman-Bey filed a civil rights action in the <a href="http://www.miwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Michigan</a> [official website], claiming that six of the prison's employees had violated his constitutional rights of access to the courts. The district court denied his motion to proceed because he had three previous dismissals, or "strikes." However, Coleman-Bey contended that he had only two previous "strikes" because his most recent dismissal was still on appeal. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in October of last year. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-visa-denials-prisoners-access-to-courts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kuwait's Supreme Court on Monday upheld the two-year prison sentence against activist <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/who-is-musallam-al-barrak-1.1095928">Musallam al-Barrack</a> [Gulf News profile] for insulting Kuwait's ruler.Al-Barrack, a former lawmaker, was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but that sentence was later shortened on appeal to two years. The case against al-Barrack <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">began</a> [JURIST report] after he gave a speech in October 2012 in which he urged Kuwait's ruler Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah "not to 'drag the country into a dark abyss' while charging that Kuwait risked becoming an autocratic state under new electoral laws." In March 2013 a protest in Kuwait City consisting of hundreds of al-Barrack's supporters became violent when they marched toward the parliament building. Police used batons against the protesters and arrested at least a dozen people. Al-Barrack was also arrested in 2014 after he revealed documents alleging large sums of illegal financial transfers were made to senior officials, including judges in Kuwait. After his arrest, more violent protests ensued. Al-Barrack's lawyer stated that his client will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/kuwait-court-upholds-2-year-sentence-against-activist/2015/05/18/18bbfdee-fd4c-11e4-8c77-bf274685e1df_story.html">surrender to authorities</a> [AP report] once court paperwork is complete.</p>

<p>Throughout the years the Kuwaiti government has been criticized for restricting rights to assembly and for prohibitions of free speech in the country. In March <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that riot police in Kuwait disbanded protests, <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/jurist-riot-police-in-kuwait.php">arresting 16 protesters </a> [JURIST report] who may be charged with attacking law enforcement officers and illegal gathering. In January Nabil al-Fadhl, a member of the Kuwait parliament, was charged with <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-lawmaker-facing-legal-action-for-supporting-sale-of-alcohol.php">insulting</a> [JURIST report] the honor of Kuwaiti society and history after making a comment in support of the legalized sale of alcohol. Also in January Kuwaiti authorities ordered the 10-day detainment of former lawmaker Saleh al-Mullah for tweets <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-authorities-detain-former-lawmaker-for-tweets-critical-of-egypt.php">criticizing</a> [JURIST report] the Gulf country's leader and his support for Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi. Later that month a Kuwaiti appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kuwait-court-upholds-prison-sentence-for-insulting-ruler-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling that sentenced a man to five years in prison for posting comments about the Gulf nation's ruler on Twitter. A court in Kuwait last October <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/kuwait-sentences-13-to-jail-for-reciting-opposition-speech.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 13 people of challenging the country's ruler by reciting a speech by al-Barrak. In July 2013 Kuwait's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/kuwait-top-court-upholds-10-year-sentence-for-twitter-user.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a 10-year prison sentence for a man accused of posting Tweets insulting the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/muhammad_1.shtml">Prophet Mohammed</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/subdivisions/sunnishia_1.shtml">Sunni Muslim</a> [BBC backgrounders] rulers of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1412_0pl1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/city-and-county-of-san-francisco-california-v-sheehan/">City and County of SF v. Sheehan</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that two police officers who shot and injured a mentally disabled woman during the course of an arrest are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for the injuries suffered. The court held that the officers did not violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] when they opened the armed and mentally ill woman's door a second time rather than attempt to accommodate her disability. Although it was alleged that the officers' conduct was contrary to their training, the opinion by Justice Samuel Alito concluded that, "even if Reynolds and Holder misjudged the situation, Sheehan cannot 'establish a Fourth Amendment violation based merely on bad tactics that result in a deadly confrontation that could have been avoided.'" The court also determined that the degree of force used was reasonable under the circumstances. </p>

<p>The court dismissed as improvidently granted the question whether <a href="http://www.ada.gov/ada_title_II.htm">Title II</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text] requires police officers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody, a question of law that has resulted in a circuit split. The issue was not argued by San Francisco as expected, and Justice Antonin Scalia addressed this in an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice Elena Kagan joined. In his dissenting opinion Scalia stated, "I would not encourage future litigants to seek review premised on arguments they never plan to press," and suggested that the second question presented should have been dismissed as "uncertworthy."  The ADA has led to considerable litigation throughout the country considering the rights of citizens with a range of disabilities and the opinion Monday does not provide any further clarification on the duties imposed on police officers by Title II of the act.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-400_f2ah.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/harris-v-viegelahn/">Harris v. Viegelahn</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return of any postpetition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee. Petitioner Charles Harris, after filing a voluntary petition for <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter13.aspx">Chapter 13</a> bankruptcy and continuing to pay under that plan for about a year, exercised his right to convert his case to <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter7.aspx">Chapter 7</a> [materials]. While the conversion terminated the service of the Chapter 13 trustee, the former Chapter 13 trustee still held more than $4,300 of Harris' wages that had been reserved for his mortgage lender and distributed those funds to his other creditors. In response, Harris moved to compel the refund of this money. While the motion was granted by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court, it was ultimately reversed by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], which held that the former trustee was authorized to distribute the post-petition wages despite the conversion. In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed that decision.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-adds-4-cases-to-docket.php">added the case to its docket</a> [JURIST report] in December. <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-bankruptcy-cases.php">Oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] were heard last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court: Felons may sell or transfer firearms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1487_l6gn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/henderson-v-united-states-2/">Henderson v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that individuals convicted of felonies may transfer firearms to independent third parties or have them sold. The court reversed the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/11th-12-14628.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], which ruled that through <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/constructive_possession">constructive possession</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], a felon might still exert control over those firearms. In its ruling, the court rejected the government's main premise based on the theory of "unclean hands," which proscribes equitable relief when an individual's misconduct has "immediate and necessary relation to the equity that he seeks," and concluded that the prohibition on firearm possession did not extend to firearm transfers. The court did not do away with the doctrine completely, however, as the reviewing court is permitted to "seek certain assurances" that may still "fail to provide adequate safeguard, [in which case] a court should then disapprove of the transfer." In ruling, the court ultimately held that transfer of firearms in accordance with <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_41">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g)</a> [text] does not violate <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">18 USC § 922(g)(1)</a> [text], which makes it unlawful for convicted felons to possess firearms. </p>

<p>The petitioner in the case, Tony Henderson, was arrested for a felony offense in 2006 and turned over his collection of firearms to federal agents as a condition of his release. The collection of guns includes a number of valuable items and antiques. Beginning in 2008, Henderson requested that the court transfer ownership of his weapons to his wife or a third party that agreed to pay for them, on the basis that he would not possess a firearm. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in October to determine, "whether [a felony] conviction prevents a court under Rule 41(g) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or under general equity principles from ordering that the government (1) transfer non-contraband firearms to an unrelated third party to whom the defendant has sold all his property interests or (2) sell the firearms for the benefit of the defendant." The Third, Sixth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits bar such sales, while the Second, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits allow them. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-firearm-possession-and-erisa-plans.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral argument in February. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration">Obama administration</a> [official website] on Monday announced a ban on federal transfers of certain military-style equipment to local police forces. The ban, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/le_equipment_wg_final_report_final.pdf">recommended</a> [text, PDF] by a task-force <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/16/executive-order-federal-support-local-law-enforcement-equipment-acquisit">created</a> [executive order] in January, includes tracked armored vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers, .50-caliber and higher ammunition, and some types of camouflage, and sets up policing standards for other equipment. Speaking at the <a href="http://camdenkroc.salvationarmy.org/">Ray and Joan Kroc Center</a> [official website] in Camden, New Jersey, Obama made clear that this measure is part of an effort to ease tensions between local police forces and minority communities, stating:<blockquote>We've seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them. Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments.</blockquote>Opponents deem the measure an overreaction, emphasizing that most equipment received from the military is administrative or defensive in nature. </p>

<p>Announcing the measure in Camden, Obama <a href="http://time.com/3882679/barack-obama-camden/">highlighted the progress</a> [TIME report] the city has made integrating the police force into the community, which stands in stark contrast to the recent crises in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, among other cities. Earlier this month US Attorney General Loretta Lynch <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-attorney-general-announces-investigation-into-baltimore-police.php">announced a federal civil rights investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Baltimore's police. The week before, the State's Attorney for Baltimore City <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-charged-in-freddie-gray-death.php">charged six police officers</a> [JURIST report] with crimes including murder and manslaughter over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. Last year a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Micheal Brown, causing mass protests and violence in the Ferguson community. The case had reached international news with AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The American Civil Liberties Union also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces puts citizens at risk rather than protects them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court sentenced 30 members of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] on Monday to life imprisonment on charges of violent behavior. The largest case concerned 17 out of the 30 defendants and included charges stemming from attempts made on the lives of protestors in Mansoura. Of the 17, 15 were charged <em>in absentia</em>, while one was sentenced to five years in prison. The remaining defendants took part in various actions, and charges were brought for inciting violence, setting a police vehicle on fire and staging protests without permission. Sentences ranged from a death sentence for a murder and attempted murder of two businessmen in Mansoura, to 10 years imprisonment for lesser charges. </p>

<p>On Saturday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] ex-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. Many of Morsi's supporters belong to the Muslim Brotherhood and have become targets of current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile]. On Sunday, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-executes-6-men-convicted-of-murdering-soldiers.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] six men convicted of killing two Egyptian soldiers. Last week, Morsi supporters were <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/morsi-supporters-sentenced-to-life-for-illegal-protesting-acts-of-violence.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to life in prison for illegal protests and acts of violence which were destructive to the Al-Marg district of Cairo, but were said to be in protest of death sentences handed down for members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Members of the Brotherhood were also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] early this year on charges of murder and possession of firearms stemming from clashes that took place days before Morsi's ouster. </p>]]></content:encoded>

W.A. Ross Construction Co.</a> (1940) [opinion], for government contractors is restricted to claims arising out of property damage caused by public works projects. Should the court answer in the affirmative for the first question, and in the negative for the second, businesses would be allowed to pre-empt costly class action suits by offering the lead plaintiff everything to which he would have been entitled, in order to eliminate the suit's viability. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/14-1335.Opinion.5-14-2015.1.PDF">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] Apple's smartphone patent victory against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> but remanded the case to the lower court to reduce the damages that must be paid to <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate websites]. The court upheld the district court's determination that Samsung infringed on some of Apple's patented iPhone technology but also found that Samsung should have prevailed over Apple's "trade dress" arguments. Trade dress is "the totality of elements in which a product ... is packaged or presented" for the purpose of "identify[ing] the source of the product." However, no trade dress patent protection is available for product features that are merely "functional" because allowing such protection would stifle market competition. The circuit court ruled that the lower court erred in denying Samsung's motion for judgment regarding Apple's phone features of rounded phone corners and "flat, clear screens" above display screens as these are clearly functional phone features and not trade dress. Therefore the court remanded to the lower court to adjust Samsung's damages to reflect that the jury's verdict on the trade dress claims has been vacated. Originally the jury had <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-affirms-samsung-infringed-on-apples-iphone-patents-1431962119">awarded</a> [WSJ report] $1.05 billion in damages, which was later reduced to $930 million. $382 million of the final award was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/18/us-samsung-apple-appeal-idUSKBN0O31E020150518">based on the trade dress claim</a> [Reuters report] and must not be reconsidered.</p>

<p>This remand for damage consideration is the most recent installment of the <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php#.U2TvNa1dXG4">ongoing patent dispute</a> [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants. In August the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-denies-apple-request-for-ban-on-samsung-phones-and-tablets.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August Apple and Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/apple-samsung-agree-to-dismiss-international-patent-disputes.php">agreed to drop</a> [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US. In June Apple and Samsung also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/apple-samsung-drop-cross-appeal-in-itc-phone-patent-dispute.php">agreed to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] their appeals of a patent infringement case at the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/index.htm">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] that resulted in an import ban on some older model Samsung phones. LastMay a jury in the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/us-jury-orders-samsung-to-pay-1196-million-to-apple.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Samsung to pay $119.6 million to Apple for two phone patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sitting <em>en banc</em>, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2015/05/18/12-57302%20EB%20opinion.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] a three-judge panel decision against <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/index.html">Google</a> [corporate website] that had required it to remove the controversial, anti-Islam <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-19572912"><em>Innocence of Muslims</em></a> [BBC backgrounder] video from its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [media website] site. The court dissolved the takedown injunction, holding that the injunction infringed upon the First Amendment and was an incorrect remedy as a matter of law. Judge Margaret McKeown wrote for the majority: <blockquote>"[The takedown order] gave short shrift to the First Amendment values at stake. The mandatory injunction censored and suppressed a politically significant film&#8212;based upon a dubious and unprecedented theory of copyright. In so doing, the panel deprived the public of the ability to view firsthand, and judge for themselves, a film at the center of an international uproar."</blockquote>YouTube may now replace the film on its website for viewing.</p>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/actress-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-anti-islam-film-film-from-youtube.php">initial lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] requesting that the film be removed from YouTube was filed by Cindy Lee Garcia, an actress who claimed to have been tricked into appearing in the video. Garcia was in the video for only five seconds, but she has received death threats for her performance, and she sought protection under copyright law. Although <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> is a spoof film, its characterization of the Prophet Mohammed as a fool and womanizer incited a rapid and violent uprising in the Middle East upon its release in September 2012, including an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left US Ambassador <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/john-christopher-stevens-us-ambassador-to-libya-dies-at-52/2012/09/12/b1c00cee-fcd0-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html">Christopher Stevens</a> [WP obituary] and three other Americans dead. Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-suspends-youtube-for-broadcasting-anti-islam-film.php">banned YouTube</a> due to the film and <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">upheld the death sentences</a> [JURIST reports] of seven Coptic Christians and an American preacher on charges stemming from the film.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile] on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to charges relating to negligence over the government's rice subsidy scheme. Yingluck maintains that she is innocent, and has <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/19/thailands-former-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to-rice-subsidy-scheme.html">stated</a> [remarks] to reporters, "I hope the court will grant me justice, and that everything will go according to due process under the law." Under the controversial rice subsidy program, the Yingluck-led government bought rice from Thai farmers above the market rate, which <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31529663">cost the state billions</a> [BBC report] of dollars. Yingluck was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-pm-ordered-to-step-down-for-abuse-of-power.php">removed from office</a> last May shortly before the military <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">seized control</a> [JURIST reports] of the government. The Thai legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/thailand-lawmakers-vote-to-impeach-former-pm.php">voted to impeach</a> [JURIST report] Yingluck in January, which bans her from holding political office for five years.</p>

<p>Thailand's political system has been unstable since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5361512.stm">2006 military coup</a> [BBC report] by the Royal Thai Army against then-prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile], brother of Yingluck. After the military overthrew the government last May, the junta has been accused of violating human rights in its attempts to maintain order. Martial law was instituted on May 20 of 2014, two days before the coup that ousted the former Thai government and installed <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">General Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] as the country's new prime minister. Since then, political demonstrations have been banned, and hundreds have been arrested for protesting the junta. A group of Thai human rights activists denounced the country's state of martial law in February, accusing the ruling military junta of imposing a <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">judicial "twilight zone"</a> [JURIST report]. The current prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha announced in April that the country's military government would <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-pm-announces-end-to-martial-law-after-10-months.php">lift the martial law</a> [JURIST report] and replace it with a new security order. Also in April, Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-completes-initial-draft-of-new-constitution.php">completed an initial draft</a> [JURIST report] of a new constitution, which, if ratified, would be the country's twentieth since 1932. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch announced that Thailand must <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-thailand-must-authorize-un-investigation-into-human-trafficking.php">authorize a UN investigation</a> [JURIST report] into human trafficking after the discovery of more than 20 bodies of ethnic Rohingya Muslims near an abandoned trafficking camp.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security and Pakistan's Intelligence Service on Tuesday agreed to share information in relation to facilitating "coordinated intelligence operations" in a memorandum of understanding. The agreement, the Landmark Intelligence Deal, is an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/19/us-afghanistan-pakistan-idUSKBN0O40KR20150519">attempt to bolster counterterrorism efforts</a> [Reuters report] between the two countries who have clashed for years. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Major General Asim Bajwa, announced the news via Twitter, and skepticism surrounding the validity of the announcement still remains.</p>

<p>The shared border between Pakistan and Afghanistan has proven to be a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30093261">security issue</a> [BBC backgrounder] for years. While Pakistan, as the main place of operations of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive], has been a focal point of global anti-terrorism efforts, the information sharing agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan will allow the countries to jointly focus their efforts towards combating terrorism. In July 2014 Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/pakistan-passes-strict-anti-terrorism-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a strict anti-terrorism bill that allows police to use lethal force, search buildings without a warrant and detain suspects at secret facilities for up to 60 days without charge "on reasonable apprehension of commission of a scheduled offense." Also that year Pakistan's prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/pakistan-pm-to-improve-anti-terrorism-laws.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] that the country's anti-terrorism laws would be amended to more effectively combat modern threats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde29/001/2015/en/">reported</a> [text] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/morocco-endemic-torture-1/">widespread torture of detainees</a> [press release] in Morocco and Western Sahara at the hands of authorities. AI documented 173 cases of torture between 2010 and 2014, including beatings, asphyxiation, drowning techniques and rape threats. The report also stated that medical care, hygiene and food are lacking in the detention cells. There were also four suspicious deaths where torture had been alleged. Those who were tortured were detained for varied reasons, ranging from activism to terrorism or other crimes. Although the Moroccan government has expressed willingness to eliminate torture, AI says safeguards against torture have not been implemented, and judges and prosecutors often fail to investigate torture claims adequately. According to AI, many medical evaluations following torture reports were performed inadequately, after a significant delay, in the presence of the accused officers, and/or lacked psychological evaluations. AI is urging the Moroccan government to ensure that defense lawyers are present during interrogations, that prosecutors and judges investigate all reports of abuse, and to protect alleged torture victims from retaliation. </p>

<p>Morocco has received international attention for alleged human rights abuses in the last year. A judge in Spain <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/spanish-judge-upholds-genocide-charges-against-7-moroccan-officials.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] in April that genocide charges against seven former and current Moroccan officials, who were accused of committing torture and killings in Western Sahara from 1975-91, were justified. In November <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported that Moroccan authorities are <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/hrw-morocco-interfering-with-human-rights-activities.php">interfering with the work of human rights organizations</a> [JURIST report]. A Moroccan court last August <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/morocco-court-sentences-activist-to-prison-for-claiming-torture.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Ouafa Charaf to one year in prison after being convicted of falsely alleging that she had been tortured by police.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's military government announced on Tuesday it will hold a referendum on a new constitution, likely delaying the general elections scheduled for mid-2016. Thailand is currently operating under a <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/633c954da7d9434f9de7ed15f38075aa/Article_2015-05-19-AS--Thailand-Constitution/id-7be670ada86f407c9aa150bec3e05f9d">temporary charter</a> [AP report] as its previous constitution was abolished after a coup last May. A <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32799690">committee</a> [BBC report] will convene in August and, if it approves the draft constitution, it would take at least three to six months to distribute copies of the constitution to the public and hold the referendum. The new constitution's provisions include unelected positions in the upper house and a proportional representation system for elections. The completed draft of the constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-completes-initial-draft-of-new-constitution.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] by the Thai Constitution Drafting Committee in April. </p>

<p>The military took control of the Thai government after a coup in May 2014, overthrowing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Martial law was instituted on May 20, two days before the <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] that ousted the former Thai government and installed <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">General Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] as the country's new prime minister. A group of Thailand human rights activists <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to the country's state of martial law in September. The previous month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-human-rights-office-claims-thailand-laws-limit-free-expression.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] that the prosecution and sentencing of lese majeste cases by Thailand's ruling military junta threaten citizens' rights of free expression. Last June a group of independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-urge-thailand-to-address-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thai authorities to reverse all measures affecting basic human rights and to restore democratic rule in the country. Shortly after the coup last May, the Thai military released <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thai-military-government-seeks-to-restrict-dissent-limit-protests.php">several statements</a> [JURIST report] banning meetings of more than five people and imposing nightly curfews. Prayuth announced in April that the country's military government will <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-pm-announces-end-to-martial-law-after-10-months.php">lift martial law</a> [JURIST report] and replace it with a new security order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The top UN human rights expert on torture, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/JuanMendez.aspx">Juan Mendez</a> [official profile], called Monday for the adoption of the revised <a href="http://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/UN_Standard_Minimum_Rules_for_the_Treatment_of_Prisoners.pdf">Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners</a> [backgrounder] in an open letter to the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/commissions/CCPCJ/">UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice</a> [official website]. The revised Rules include several practical elements that provide increased protection for detainees from torture and maltreatment, including a specific prohibition on the use of extended solitary confinement, which is defined as confinement that exceeds 15 days. The revised rules also incorporate safeguards that prohibit cruel treatment and put a burden on independent health care professionals who have a duty not to participate in torture. The approval of a resolution during the twenty-fourth session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice will allow the revised rules to move forward and be examined by the UN General Assembly in December.</p>

<p>Mendez was appointed by the UN Human Rights Council as the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel treatment or punishment in November 2010. He is independent from any government and has dedicated his career to the defense of human rights. In March Mendez released a report <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-expert-georgias-treatment-of-prisoners-improved-but-more-must-be-done.php">saying substantial progress</a> [JURIST report] has been made in Georgia with regard to eliminating torture in their prisons. The improvements have been in large part due to extensive legislative policy changes and shifts in the attitudes and mentalities of staff. In November the UN reported that Mendez had been <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-officials-i.php">blocked from completing a torture and killing investigation</a> [JURIST report] in Gambia. In September Mendez urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-rights-experts-urge-saudi-arabia-to-place-moratorium-on-executions.php">implement an immediate moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] following an increase in executions, with a significant number of the executions completed by beheading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Tennessee <a href="http://www.tn.gov/governor/">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website] on Monday signed into a law a bill requiring a 48-hour waiting period for women seeking an abortion. Those physicians who neglect to follow new rules on what to tell their patients during the counseling are at risk of having their medical licenses revoked in addition to receiving misdemeanor or felony charges. The new rules, which take effect July 1, would make Tennessee one of 27 states to require some form of abortion waiting period, although more states may soon be added to the list as legislatures begin adopting similar measures. Proponents of the new rule say it is meant to protect the health and welfare of women, in addition to the protection of unborn children and give women more time to consider abortion alternatives. Abortion rights advocates say the law represents a violation of a woman's right to an abortion.</p>

<p>Abortion waiting periods and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have been heated topics throughout the US. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website] signed House Bill 1409 into law <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/oklahoma-governor-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period.php">extending the mandatory</a> [JURIST report] waiting period for women seeking an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Also in April Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback </a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women that they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion, in addition to barring women from buying any healthcare plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">West Virginia Legislature overrode </a> [JURIST report] the state governor's veto, passing a bill that bans abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Notre-Dame-7th-CA-5-19-15.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 2-1 Tuesday that the <a href="https://www.nd.edu">University of Notre Dame</a> [official website] shall not, at the time being, be exempted from the federal government's birth control mandate. Last June, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores</a> [opinion, PDF], the US Supreme Court ruled that for profit businesses that are "closely held" (i.e., owned by a small number of individuals) <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">may be exempted</a> [JURIST report] from the birth-control mandate of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [HHS materials] if the owners had a religious objection to one or more mandated birth control devices or method. Notre Dame has been arguing that taking even the small step required to take advantage of the exemption violates its rights because doing so would promote the mandate in a way that violates its religious stance against birth control. The Seventh Circuit previously <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-court-rules-against-notre-dame-in-contraception-case.php">ruled against Notre Dame</a> [JURIST report] last year and reached the same conclusion on remand from the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's rulings on the contraceptive mandate and the mandate itself have <a href="/hotline/2014/07/myers-dessalegn-hobby-lobby.php">generated controversy</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-exception-requirements-to-contraception-mandate.php">religious non-profit groups' rights were not violated</a> [JURIST report] when required to certify that they are opting out of the <a href="/feature/featured/contraception-mandate/">contraception mandate</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The Department of Health and Humahn Services issued <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/us-government-proposes-changes-to-contraceptive-mandate-exemptions.php">proposed rules</a> [JURIST report] in August in response to the Supreme Court's rulings in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/conestoga-wood-specialties-corp-v-sebelius/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders], which held that "closely held" corporations cannot be required to provide contraceptive coverage to their female workers if the corporation's owners have religious objections. Louise Melling, deputy legal directer of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/supreme-court-allows-employers-discriminate-against-employees-denying-contraception-coverage?redirect=reproductive-freedom/supreme-court-allows-employers-discriminate-against-employees-denying">stated of the court's ruling in Hobby Lobby</a> [press release] that "[r]eligious freedom is a fundamental right, but that freedom does not include the right to impose beliefs on others. In its ruling today, the Court simply got it wrong." Barbara Green, one of the founders of Hobby Lobby, <a href="http://www.hobbylobbycase.com">said</a> [press release] that "[o]ur family is overjoyed by the Supreme Court's decision. Today the nation's highest court has re-affirmed the vital importance of religious liberty as one of our country's founding principles. The Court's decision is a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith. We are grateful to God and to those who have supported us on this difficult journey."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] on Wednesday appointed Judge Ahmed el-Zind as the country's new Justice Minster. El-Zind, who is known for being hostile towards the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder], was <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/20/anti-brotherhood-judge-named-justice-minister-in-egypt">sworn in</a> [AP report] with al-Sisi presiding over the event. As Justice Minister, el-Zind plans to continue to seek and prosecute supporters of former president Mohamed Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood members. </p>

<p>On Saturday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Morsi and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. Many of Morsi's supporters belong to the Muslim Brotherhood and have become targets of current al-Sisi. On Sunday Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-executes-6-men-convicted-of-murdering-soldiers.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] six men convicted of killing two Egyptian soldiers.

Members of the Brotherhood were also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] early this year on charges of murder and possession of firearms stemming from clashes that took place days before Morsi's ouster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Foreign ministers from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia issued a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/20/world/asia/document-malaysia-indonesia-thailand-statement-on-asia-migrants-crisis.html?_r=0">joint statement</a> [text] Wednesday addressing the recent influx of migrants arriving to their respective nations and agreeing to take in migrants in the most humanitarian fashion. While the countries have agreed on taking in migrants awaiting on ships, they have have condemned both human trafficking and smuggling that may be taking place and plan to bring to justice all those involved with both crimes. In taking these measures to welcome the numerous people at sea, both Malaysia and Indonesia have called upon the international community to help resettle the current migrants seeking to enter the three nations. For the meantime, both Indonesia and Malaysia have agreed to provide assistance to the 7,000 migrants currently still at sea. </p>

<p>Mass migrations have been occurring in Europe as well as Southeast Asia. Refuges from the conflicts in the Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. Also in April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-condems-eu-response-to-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the EU's failure to prevent migrant casualties at sea. The statement came amid reports that as many as 300 migrants had died off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Five of the world's largest banks agreed Wednesday to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-major-banks-agree-parent-level-guilty-pleas">plead guilty</a> [press release] to rigging currency markets and to pay over USD $5 billion in penalties to the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], along with several domestic and international agencies. Traders from <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/">Citicorp</a>, <a href="http://www.barclays.com">Barclays</a>, the <a href="http://www.rbs.com">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com">JPMorgan Chase</a> and <a href="https://www.ubs.com/us/en.html">UBS</a> [corporate websites] were accused of working together to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market, where hundreds of billions of euros and dollars change hands. These penalties come out of a larger effort by the DOJ to tackle financial misconduct. The banks are not being limited in their dealing in foreign currency markets, and although no executives were charged, investigations are still ongoing pertaining to that issue. The DOJ has reached <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=2008+financial+crisis">multiple settlements</a> [JURIST news archive] with large banks over the 2008 financial crisis, but this marks the first time in more than two decades that major players in the financial industry have admitted to criminal wrongdoing on such a scale, and the largest set of antitrust fines ever collected in the Department of Justice's history.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-lynch-delivers-remarks-press-conference-foreign-exchange-spot-market">remarks</a> [text] by US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [personal profile], as early as December 2007, several international banks formed a group, calling themselves "The Cartel," and engaged in "brazenly illegal behavior ... on a near-daily basis." Lynch promised to continue to work effortlessly to finish the work that her predecessor Eric Holder oversaw from the inception of this investigation. Lynch warned that these actions, "serve as a stark reminder that this Department of Justice intends to vigorously prosecute all those who tilt the economic system in their favor; who subvert our marketplaces; and who enrich themselves at the expense of American consumers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The office of Burundi <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13085065">President Pierre Nkurunziza</a> [BBC profile] announced Wednesday that the men who plotted last week's failed coup will stand trial. The 18 suspects, including three army and police generals, will be judged under the country's penal code. The coup began when leader Major General <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/who-godefroid-niyombare-meet-burundi-army-general-who-declared-coup-oust-president-1920954">Godefroid Niyombare</a> [IBT backgrounder], who is still at large, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/15/africa/burundi-coup-leaders-arrested/">made the declaration</a> [CNN report] last Wednesday. In Bujumbura, troops supporting the president and those supporting Niyombare fought on the streets Wednesday and Thursday. Following the announcement, the airport in Bujumbura and the land borders were closed, but the streets reportedly <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/15/burundi-coup-apparently-fails-as-president-is-said-to-return">calmed</a> [AP report] down Friday.</p>

<p>Burundi has faced unrest since Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in April, and the unrest intensified after the Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that he could <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">seek a third term</a> [JURIST report] in office without violating the country's constitution, which states that presidents shall be universally elected into office for a term of five years and can renew the term once. Burundi authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-police-arrest-opposition-leader-for-meeting-with-african-delegates.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] political opposition leader Audifax Ndabitoreye in May shortly after he met with East African Community ministers in the capital city of Bujumbura. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over actions by Burundian authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections. The OHCHR said last month that the upcoming elections in Burundi place the nation at a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">critical moment in history</a> [JURIST report], urging the nation to choose democracy in the elections. Burundi has also been criticized for human rights violations and limitations on freedom in the last few years. In February Human Rights Watch [advocacy website] said that Burundian National Defense Forces and police committed at least 47 <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-burundi-forces-committing-extrajudiicial-executions.php">extrajudicial executions</a> [JURIST report] following confrontation with an armed group in Cibitoke. HRW also said that armed members of the Burundian youth force, known as the Imbonerakure, participated in the executions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Louisiana legislatures on Tuesday rejected a religious objections bill that was pushed by <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/">Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website]. A House legal committee <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/79bd1ee4d8e1470fb31765e8f0de91be/religious-objections-bill-rejected-la-house-committee">voted 10-2</a> [AP report] to kill the bill, ending weeks of serious debate. However, in an effort to solicit Christian conservatives for his likely presidential bid in 2016, Jindal immediately responded by issuing an executive order aimed at doing essentially the same thing as the bill, just on a smaller scale. The proposed bill would prohibit the state from taking punitive action against individuals, businesses and nonprofits because of actions they take "in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction" about marriage. Critics believe that such an action could lead to discriminatory practices. The move by Jindal was also criticized as basically a political statement and likely to have "very little practical impact."</p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, as well as freedom of religious practice, remain controversial issues in the US. Nineteen other states have enacted some variety of religious freedom laws, most modeled after the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993. Indiana and Arkansas were in the spotlight earlier this year for signing two similar bills into law. In late March the Arkansas Senate approved a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arkansas-senate-passes-religious-freedom-bill.php">controversial bill</a> [JURIST report] intended to protect religious freedoms of businesses that critics said could allow people to go too far and refuse service to LGBT individuals. Also in late March the Indiana Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to a very similar bill that would allow business owners the same "freedoms." However, in April the governors of the two states <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-arkansas-governors-sign-amended-religious-freedom-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] amended versions of the bills stating that the religious freedom law does not authorize any business to refuse to provide service to any individual or customer based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in addition to race, color, religion, age, national origin, disability and military service.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nebraska lawmakers voted 32-15 Wednesday to approve a <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=25136">bill</a> [LB 268 materials] abolishing the death penalty. Earlier in April Nebraska lawmakers voted 30-13 <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/nebraska-advances-bill-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">in favor</a> [JURIST report] of the legislation to repeal the death penalty and replace it with life imprisonment in first-degree murder cases. <a href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/">Governor Pete Ricketts</a> [official website], who supports capital punishment and has promised to veto the bill, said that "the vote represented a 'dark day' for public safety." At least 30 votes are needed to override Rickett's veto of the bill. </p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST archive] and execution method issues have been the hot topics of the death penalty debate for the past few years. In April the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/tennessee-top-court-postpones-executions-to-determine-constitutional-issues.php">postponed the execution</a> [JURIST report] of four inmates on death row while it determines whether current protocols are constitutional, thus effectively halting all executions in the state. Also in April the Delaware Senate voted to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">repeal the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the only states with that option. Oklahoma became the <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">epicenter</a> [JURIST report] of the lethal injection drug debate last year after the death of Clayton Lockett, a death row inmate who died of an apparent attack minutes after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.visupremecourt.org/">Supreme Court of the US Virgin Islands</a> [official website] <a href="http://viconsortium.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/In-the-matter-of-adoption.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that second-parent adoptions by same-sex couples are permitted under Virgin Islands law. The children's fathers are anonymous sperm donors who knowingly waived all of their parental rights. The biological mother and her same-sex partner filed an adoption petition in the <a href="http://www.visuperiorcourt.org/">Superior Court of the Virgin Islands</a> [official website] in December 2012, which the court rejected. In an opinion by Justice Maria Cabret, the Supreme Court ruled<blockquote>The Superior Court erred in denying the appellants' petition for a second-parent adoption because, regardless of whether their marriage is recognized in the Virgin Islands [Virgin Islands law] broadly provides that "[a]ny inhabitant of the Virgin Islands" may petition for an adoption. And even though the adoption statutes do not provide any exceptions to the operation of [Virgin Islands law]&#8212;providing that an adoption decree terminates "all legal rights [of the natural parents] as respects the child"&#8212;a strict application of this provision would preclude any stepparent or second-parent adoptions in the Virgin Islands and undermine the Legislature's directive that the best interests of the child must be paramount in adoption proceedings.</blockquote>The Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings, considering the best interests of the child.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and adoption remain divisive and controversial issues around the world. In April the Florida Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/florida-senate-votes-to-repeal-ban-on-same-sex-adoption.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the state's ban on same-sex adoption. In March the <a href="http://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/en/Home">Slovenian Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/slovenia-approves-same-sex-marriage-adoption-legislation.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] granting same-sex marriage and adoption rights amid public opposition from conservative and religious groups. In February the <a href="http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/">Constitutional Court of Colombia</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/Colombia-court-upholds-restrictions-on-adoption-for-same-sex-couples.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that same-sex couples cannot adopt children that have no biological relation to either parent. In June the <a href="http://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public">Chambre des Deputes</a> [official website, in French], Luxembourg's national legislative body, <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/luxembourg-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-adoption.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] extending marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State's Attorney for Baltimore City on Thursday <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/media-center/press-releases/731-marilyn-mosby-announces-indictments-of-the-six-baltimore-police-officers-involved-in-the-freddie-gray-arrest">announced the indictment</a> [press release] of six police officers on charges including murder and manslaughter over the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Baltimore state attorney <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/office/meet-marilyn-mosby">Marilyn Mosby</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-charged-in-freddie-gray-death.php">filed charges</a> [JURIST report] earlier in May upon receiving the medical examiner's report that ruled Gray's death a homicide. Mosby's office presented evidence to a grand jury, which returned indictments Thursday on all charges presented. An arraignment is scheduled for July 2.</p>

<p>Gray's arrest and death led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. Last month <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">urged Baltimore police to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force. Also in April, amidst national concern about police behavior, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] announced a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-20-million-funding-support-body-worn-camera-pilot-program">$20 million body camera grant</a> [press release] program that includes training, technical assistance and evaluation to accompany $17 million for local law enforcement agencies to purchase body-worn cameras. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, "Body-worn cameras hold tremendous promise for enhancing transparency, promoting accountability, and advancing public safety for law enforcement officers and the communities they serve."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Amnesty: Qatar failing to deliver on promised migrant labor reforms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] More than a year after Qatar's government promised reform for migrant workers, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/mounting-risk-of-world-cup-built-on-abuse-as-qatar-fails-to-deliver-reforms-2/">little to no improvement has been made</a> [press release], <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said Thursday. The government <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/qatar-announces-plans-to-address-controversial-migrant-worker-laws.php">announced in November</a> [JURIST report] that the kafala sponsorship system, which currently limits the rights of foreign workers, is to be replaced with legislation that promotes a new employment contract system. However, in a new <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE22/1570/2015/en/">report</a> [text, PDF] by AI, the advocacy group identified nine issues pertinent to migrant labor rights that the government promised to address but has so far ignored. The government has made limited progress on five of those issues, while the government has failed to respond to four of the issues altogether. More than 1.5 million migrant workers in Qatar face exit permit issues, restrictions on changing employers in Qatar's kafala system, protection of domestic workers and the inability to form or join trade unions. The need for migrant labor has expanded due to Qatar's construction boom and bid to host the 2022 World Cup in the small Gulf State. AI has called on the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to pressure Qatar's government to ensure that football stadiums are not built at the expense of migrant exploitation and abuse. </p>

<p>Domestic workers, especially those working abroad, tend to have far fewer protections than other classes of workers. In August the president of Brazil signed into law a <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/brazil-president-signs-law-expanding-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">measure </a>[JURIST report] providing basic protections to Brazilian domestic workers. In April AI reported on the <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/ai-qatar-failing-to-protect-foreign-domestic-workers-from-exploitation.php">human rights abuses faced by migrant domestic workers</a> [JURIST report] in Qatar. In November Human Rights Watch issued a letter to the Labor Minister of Morocco, Abdeslam Seddiki, imploring the Moroccan government to revise a draft law before the Moroccan parliament regarding legal protections for domestic workers to comply with international standards. In 2011 <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization </a>[official website] passed the<a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C189"> Domestic Workers Convention </a>(No. 189) [text], a measure extending basic labor rights to workers in signatory countries, including days off each week, set hours and a minimum wage. The law came into <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/ilo-domestic-worker-rights-treaty-enters-into-force.php">effect</a> [JURIST report] in September of 2013 for signatory countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An 84-year old attorney, businessman and political candidate filed a lawsuit in a Tennessee court on Wednesday, challenging a law that makes it a felony for a doctor or another person helps someone commit suicide. John Jay Hooker, who once ran for Tennessee governor and worked for Robert F. Kennedy, said the law <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/state/john-jay-hooker-files-suit-over-tennessees-approach-to-assisted-suicides_20659657">violates the state constitution</a> [AP report], specifically the pursuit of happiness. Hooker has terminal cancer, and hopes to fight for the issue in the state legislature. House Minority leader Craig Fitzhugh (D-Ripley) is sponsoring the bill.</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue in the US and around the world. In January California lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/california-lawmakers-propose-assisted-suicide-bill.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0101-0150/sb_128_bill_20150120_introduced.pdf">bill </a>[SB 128, PDF] to permit patients who meet specific criteria the right to medically end their lives. In February the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/canadian-supreme-court-authorizes-medically-assisted-suicide.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the country's ban on medically assisted suicide. Also that month a group of patients and doctors filed a lawsuit in a New York court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/new-york-doctors-patients-file-assisted-suicide-lawsuit.php">requesting a declaration</a> [JURIST report] that physician-assisted suicide is not illegal under New York state law. In 2006 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], making Oregon the only US state that allowed assisted suicide at that time. Vermont, Washington, New Mexico and Montana now also allow assisted suicide. Possibly the most contentious right to die case ended in 2005, when <a href="/forum/2005/12/living-and-dying-in-post-schiavo-world.php">Terri Schiavo</a> [JURIST op-ed] passed away following a heated legal battle between family members on whether to artificially maintain her life in a vegetative state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] EU foreign policy chief <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/30/portrait-federica-mogherini-eu-foreign-policy-chief">Federica Mogherini</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile] on Thursday expressed great <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150521_01_en.htm">concern over potential war crimes</a> [press release] being committed by <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] militants in the UNESCO World Heritage site of <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/23">Palmyra</a> [UNESCO profile]. The statement came after members of IS <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32820857">entered</a> [BBC report] the site of Palmyra after seizing the neighboring town. "With the reported occupation of the ancient city of Palmyra by [the Islamic State], yet again hundreds of people have been killed and thousands more risk to be exposed to arbitrary violent actions and more destructions of cultural sites might be perpetrated," Mogherini said in the statement. "[The Islamic State's] mass killings and deliberate destruction of archaeological and cultural heritage in Syria and Iraq amount to a war crime according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court." The seizure comes during the IS's current campaign of "cultural cleansing" in which the group is destroying significant historical relics all across the area of ancient Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. In March the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the actions of IS in Iraq may amount to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. In February the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">jointly released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. Also in February IS led suicide bombings in eastern Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/islamic-state-kills-40-in-suicide-bombing.php">killing at least 40 people</a> [JURIST report] and injuring 70 more. IS said this was the group's way of retaliating against Egyptian airstrikes protesting the IS presence in Northern Africa. In December the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">reported that the IS executed</a> [JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="www.aclumich.org/">ACLU of Michigan</a> [advocacy websites] on Thursday filed a <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/file/Love_v_Johnson_IDpolicy_Complaint052115.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/issues/gender-marker/2015-05/2162">press release</a>] on behalf of six Michigan transgender individuals against Secretary of State <a href="http://www.rj4mi.com/">Ruth Johnson</a> [official website] challenging a state policy that they claim makes it nearly impossible for transgender individuals to change the gender recorded on their driver licenses and other forms of identification. The lawsuit states that the policy represents a refusal by the state to accept such situations of gender identity, and seeks a court order declaring the policy unconstitutional. The policy says that the state cannot change a person's gender on their driver's license or state identification unless that person produces an amended birth certificate showing the correct gender. However, the process of obtaining such an amended birth certificate can be very difficult or sometimes impossible for some individuals. Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for the <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/courts/lgbt-project">ACLU of Michigan LGBT Project</a> [official website] stated, "By refusing to provide transgender people with identity documents that match their correct gender identity, the state makes it unimaginably difficult for them to navigate their everyday lives."</p>

<p>Transgender rights are currently hotly contested legal issue. In April US District Judge Jon Tigar for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/federal-judge-orders-california-prison-to-grant-inmate-sex-change.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the California Department of Corrections to grant a transgender inmate's sex reassignment surgery. In March a transgender inmate from Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/transgender-inmate-petitions-supreme-court-for-sex-reassignment-surgery.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] for <em>certiorari</em> to the Supreme Court, asking to overturn a ruling that denied her sex reassignment surgery. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Sudan government troops are <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/05/south-sudan-escalation-of-violence-points-to-failed-regional-and-international-action/">committing human rights abuses</a> [press release], such as abusing civilians and lighting villages on fire amid ongoing fighting in the region, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported Thursday. AI has also received reports that South Sudan government troops have committed other atrocities while dressed in civilian clothing such as attacking villages with axes, guns and machetes. Many aid groups have recently <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/9/aid-groups-thousands-flee-fighting-in-south-sudan.html">pulled out their staff</a> [Al Jazeera report] due to safety concerns as fighting intensifies. It is estimated that seven civilians have been killed as a result of the intense fighting, and approximately 20,000 civilians have been displaced.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudanese Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25427965">report</a>] has persisted since December 2013 when President Salva Kiir Mayardit accused his ex-vice-president, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/2013/12/profile-south-sudan-riek-machar-20131230201534595392.html">Riek Machar</a> [Al Jazeera profile], of plotting to overthrow him. In late March, <a href="http://www.goss.org/index.php/legislative-assembly">South Sudan's National Legislative Assembly</a> [official website] voted to extend Kiir's term by three years following the cancellation of elections that were to be held in June, and the dissolution of negotiations to end the country's internal conflict. Earlier in March <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-sg-urges-south-sudan-political-opponents-to-end-rivalry-comply-with-international-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Kiir and Machar to end the hostilities and comply with international law to avoid sanctions. In late February UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/unicef-condemns-abduction-of-children-by-armed-forces-in-south-sudan.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the abduction of young boys by an armed group in South Sudan. In early February Human Rights Watch reported that both parties in the conflict are <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-south-sudan-government-recruiting-child-soldiers.php">recruiting children</a> [JURIST report], with close to 600 child soldiers being used since the beginning of the conflict. Earlier in February the UN reported <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-south-sudan-government-recruiting-child-soldiers.php">continued rights violations</a> [JURIST report] just when the groups were on the brink of signing a peace deal. In January the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-south-sudan-civilian-attacks-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">reported attacks</a> [JURIST report] on civilians based on ethnicity and political beliefs in Sudan that amounted to several war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military court in Israel on Thursday ordered Palestinian lawmaker, Khalida Jarrar, be released on bail. Under the terms of her release, she is to pay a 20,000-shekel (USD $5,000) bond with a third-party guarantee. She is to be held <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.657641">three additional days</a> [Haaretz report] pending a possible appeal.</p>

<p>Jarrar, a member of the <a href="http://pflp.ps/english/">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a> (PFLP) [party website], was <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.650216">arrested</a> [AP report] last month by the Israeli military for <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/israel-authorities-order-detention-of-palestine-lawmaker.php">incitement and involvement in terrorist activities</a> [JURIST report] after she disobeyed an Israel-ordered restriction from movement in the West Bank. She was placed under Israeli <a href="http://pflp.ps/english/2015/04/05/pflp-administrative-detention-order-against-khalida-jarrar-will-not-shake-her-steadfastness/">administrative detention</a> [PFLP press release], a system Israel says exists to prevent attacks by militants. Under administrative detention, individuals may be held captive for up to six months without being charged. The detention may be extended under a judge's approval, and evidence regarding the arrest may be withheld if deemed necessary.Some have called Jarrar's arrest a politically-fueled act, as Jarrar was instrumental in the Palestinian Authority's bid to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/palestine-formally-joins-the-icc.php">formally join</a>[JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate </a>[official website] on Saturday blocked a House passed bill that would end the mass collection of phone records by the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency </a>(NSA) [official website] in an after midnight vote of 57-42. Supporters of the measure were unable to secure the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/60c0d988801742cf96cf8d725466c6e0/senate-expected-act-nsa-collection-phone-records">60 votes</a> [AP report] needed to move forward, and no action was taken by the Senate to extend or replace the program which is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-is-playing-chicken-with-nsa-spy-program-white-house-says/2015/05/22/796e3574-00af-11e5-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html">set to expire</a> [WP report] at the end of May. The bill, titled the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3361">USA Freedom Act</a> [text], was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-house-approves-bill-to-eliminate-phone-data-collection.php">approved </a>[JURIST report] by the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Wednesday by a vote of 338 to 88 and largely extended the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">USA Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF]. Despite the White House's <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">support </a>[JURIST report] for the bill and the elimination of phone data collection, the compromise legislation was rejected by the Senate. Also rejected were several short term extensions to the USA Patriot Act. The matter will be revisited by the Senate on Sunday, May 31, before the program's midnight expiration, and whatever the Senate approves must be passed by the House.</p>

<p>Several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called </a>[JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations </a>[JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden"> Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/hilite/">ruled </a>[opinion, PDF] earlier this month that the Patriot Act <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">does not authorize </a>[JURIST report] the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">United Nations Security Council </a>[official website] on Saturday <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11901.doc.htm">adopted </a>[press release] a resolution which encourages increased cooperation in preventing the "illicit transfer, destabilizing, accumulation and misuse" of weapons, including small arms and light weapons. The resolution was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50946#.VWCe_U_BzGd">adopted </a>[<em>UN News Centre</em> report] after a vote of nine in favor and none against. Six  members, Angola, Chad, China, Nigeria, Russian Federation and Venezuela, abstained, expressing concern about the lack of attention paid to keeping arms from all non-state actors. Mahamat Zene Cherif of Chad compared the refusal to expressly state in a provision that the transfer of arms to non-State actors would be made illegal to a refusal to prevent violence and conflict in a fragile state. The Security Council held a meeting on the issue of Member States that had not yet taken measures to regulate small arms deals last week. The resolution calls upon member States to consider ratifying or acceding to the <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/ATT/">Arms Trade Treaty</a> (ATT) [materials] as soon as possible. </p>

<p>This is not the first time that the UN has addressed issues relating to the arms trade in recent years. In April 2014 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/jurist-un-secretary-general-ban-ki-moon-1.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] all nations to sign the <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/ATT/">UN Arms Trade Treaty</a> [UN backgrounder]. In May 2013 JURIST Guest Columnist Clare da Silva of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2013/05/clare-da-silva-arms-trade.php">argued </a>[JURIST op-ed] that the treaty showed remarkable progress in the international regulation of arms transactions. The treaty prohibits states from exporting conventional weapons to governments in violation of UN arms embargoes and from exporting conventional weapons which may be used in genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or terrorism. It also requires that states prevent conventional weapons from reaching the black market. The treaty does not control the use of domestic weapons. Restrictions on ammunition were considered, but the US struck down the idea. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-votes-to-negotiate-international-arms-treaty.php">voted </a>[JURIST report] to re-enter negotiations over an international arms treaty in December 2012. Previous negotiations had fallen apart, and many blamed the political climate in the US and the substantial pressure from the NRA to veto any international arms treaty. In July 2012 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/deadline-for-un-arms-treaty-passes-without-consensus.php">allowed </a>[JURIST report] the deadline for an arms treaty to pass without reaching a consensus. Earlier that month Ban had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-treaty-to-regulate-international-arms-trade.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the UN member states to establish a comprehensive arms treaty to limit the flow of conventional arms to terrorists and criminal networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/21/eu-don-t-endanger-lives-sea-or-deny-protection">expressed concern</a> [press release] over the human rights issues raised by EUNAVFOR MED, an EU implemented naval operation to identify, capture and destroy boats used by smugglers in the Mediterranean. The <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/splash/?requested=%2f"> Council of the European Union</a> [official website] <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_122_R_0004&from=EN">agreed</a> [decision, PDF] to create the program on Monday with the stated purpose of "prevent[ing] human tragedies resulting from the smuggling," however, HRW's Judith Sunderland, acting deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia Division, responded to the plan and said <blockquote>&#8220;[t]he EU needs to be honest in assessing how its intervention will push desperate people to take even more dangerous journeys, what becomes of people in need of protection seeking to leave an increasingly chaotic and violent Libya, and how this squares with international obligations.&#8221;</blockquote> HRW encouraged the EU to consider proactive methods to improve the human rights situation dealt with by the asylum seekers instead of continued focus on limiting entry to EU borders.  </p>

<p>The naval operation is the EU&#8217;s response to the present crisis in the Mediterranean. Since the beginning of 2015, at least 1,780 migrants and asylum seekers have died attempting the sea journey. Earlier in May Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/amnesty-libya-migrants-facing-rape-and-torture.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that refugees and migrants crossing through Libya faced human rights abuses including torture and rape causing many to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea trying to escape. In April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. Also in April the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php"> called</a> [JURIST report] on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] On Saturday Ireland became the first country to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/05/23/ireland-gay-marriage-referendum/27833821/">legalize</a> [USA Today] same-sex marriage by national referendum. The results showed that 62.1% of voters were in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. The traditionally conservative Catholic country surprised the international community and moved from criminalizing homosexuality to embracing same-sex marriage rights in a little over two decades. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/"> Constitution of Ireland</a> [text] will now be changed to allow same-sex couples to be legally wed. Praise for the decision came from both the Irish community and many international supporters.   </p>

<p>Same-sex couples have varied marriage rights throughout the world. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to rule on same-sex marriage, granting certiorari in four separate cases, and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on one case in late April. A decision is expected by the end of June. In August Ugandan Attorney General Peter Nyomb <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal against the constitutional court ruling that struck down the nation's anti-homosexuality law. Last January the Nigerian president <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, banning same-sex marriage and criminalizing same-sex relationships. Similar laws exist in <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">Singapore</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-condemns-lgbt-discrimination-in-jamaica.php">Jamaica</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian President <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/">Vladmir Putin</a> [official website] signed a law on Sunday that allows for foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or firms deemed "undesirable" on national security grounds to be sanctioned and banned from operation within the country.  Further, the term undesirable is open to interpretation and not specifically defined within the statute. Under the law, Russian authorities would essentially be allowed to prosecute organizations they believe pose a threat to Russia's Constitutional order, defensive capacity and national security. These organizations could face up to six years in prison as well as fines. The <a href="http://www.state.gov">US Department of State </a> [official website] said it was "deeply troubled" by the new law.  Advocacy group <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/05/russia-squeezes-undesirable-organizations/">said </a>[AI report] that the bill would "squeeze the life from civil society" while <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/20/russia-government-against-rights-groups">warned </a>[HRW report] that it would be locals who would be most heavily impacted. HRW Europe and Central Asia Director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/hugh-williamson">Hugh Williamson</a> [official profile] stated, "There is little doubt that [the law's] primary targets are Russian activists and Russian Independent agencies." Supporters of the law said that the law is necessary due to Russia's involvement in the Ukraine.</p>

<p>With the signing of this law, Russia is building on its already restrictive laws for foreign NGOs within the country.  In 2012 the Russian Federal Council, the country's upper house of parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that labels NGOs that accept international funding as "foreign agents." In August 2013, Russia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/russia-court-receives-first-official-complaint-against-new-ngo-law.php"> received</a> [JURIST report] the first official complaint against the country's new law, which requires political NGOs receiving funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents." Kostroma Center was fined 300,000 rubles (USD $9,000) for organizing a roundtable with US diplomats, which investigators said counted as "political activity." Since the NGO law <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-activists-to-appeal-ngo-law-to-europe-rights-court.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in 2012, Russian activists have vowed to challenge it. Leading rights groups, including <a href="http://www.memo.ru/eng/">Memorial </a>[official website], election-monitoring body<a href="http://golos.org"> Golos</a> [official website, in Russian] and the <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/english/18E49C2">Moscow Helsinki Group</a> [official website] have all chosen to appeal to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)</a> [official website]. The US State Department <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/us-russia-putin-ngos-idUSBRE86K05M20120721">claimed </a>[Reuters report] it had "deep concern" about the new bill, but was likewise reminded by Moscow that such an issue involves domestic rather than international policy. In April 2013, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org">released a report</a> [text, PDF] analyzing the law and calling for its repeal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]<a href="http://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/"> Myanmar President Thein Sein</a> [official website] on Saturday signed into law a bill requiring some mothers to space the births of their children three years apart.  The Population Control Health Care bill, passed by parliament last month, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/myanmar-president-signs-off-on-controversial-population-law/304802641">allows authorities</a> [AP report] the power to implement "birth-spacing" in areas with high rates of population growth. Though the bill has no punitive measures, <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/236057.htm">U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken</a> [official website] and right activists worry it will be used to repress women's rights as well as religious and ethnic minority rights. Speaking on the matter, Blinken stated "We shared the concerns that these bills can exacerbate ethnic and religious divisions and undermine the country's efforts to promote tolerance and diversity." The government claims the bill and three others like it were aimed at bringing down maternal and infant mortality rates and protecting women and minorities, but activists argue that there are better ways to accomplish this goal.  </p>

<p>Myanmar has long been critiqued for its human rights situation.  <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International (AI)</a> and the <a href="http://www.icj.org">International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)</a> [advocacy websites] in March <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/myanmar-urged-to-reject-proposed-legislation-on-religion-and-race.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to reject or revise proposed laws they claim would "entrench already widespread discrimination and risk fueling further violence against religious minorities." Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-expert-raises-concerns-over-deteriorating-human-rights-in-myanmar.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] last April about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rakhine">Rakhine State</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January of last year Quintana, along with the UN humanitarian chief, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-calls-for-probe-into-violence-in-myanmar.php#.U0La3lcS-CY">called for an immediate investigation</a> [JURIST report] by authorities following reports of alarming levels of violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state. In October 2013 Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-conflict-in-rakhine-continues-to-inspire-sectarian-violence-in-myanmar.php#.U0LcJFcS-CY">warned</a> [JURIST report] that sectarian violence between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State was contributing to wider anti-Muslim sentiments in Myanmar, threatening the positive changes undertaken by the country in the past two years. While Quintana acknowledged that Myanmar's government has demonstrated willingness to address the situation, he expressed concern that discriminatory acts against Muslims remain unattended. Earlier that month Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-welcomes-myanmars-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php#.U0LcQlcS-CY">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the release of 56 prisoners of conscience in Myanmar, although he stressed the need for legislative reforms that would address the injustice against prisoners of conscience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of Peru on Saturday declared a two-month period of martial law in the southern state of Arequipa where residents are protesting the construction of a copper mine. Being under martial law allows police to enter homes without search warrants, as well as to break up protests and meetings. <a href="http://www.southernperu.com/ENG/Pages/default.aspx">Southern Copper Corporation</a> [official website] plans to build a copper mine known as Tia Maria for $1.4 billion, which residents strongly feel will contaminate the water and air in the region. Specifically, they believe that the mine will be detrimental to farming in the area by using too much water and also creating dust in a neighboring village where many crops are grown. Protests have continued for over two months and often turn violent, even after the government <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/peru-approves-stalled-tia-maria-copper-mine-project-1407176876">approved</a> [WSJ report] the company's environmental study last year that claimed the company could operate a clean mine. The government had already sent in over 4,000 police officers and 1,000 soldiers to the area to try and control the protests, which have resulted in the deaths one police officer and three protesters. Jose Ramos Carrera, mayor of Punta de Bombon, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/peru-declares-2-month-martial-law-in-area-of-disputed-copper-mine-1432396221">stated</a> [WSJ report] that although residents will continue to oppose after martial law begins, what the declaration "shows is that the government wants the mine to go ahead at all costs."</p>

<p>Mining effects on the environment have been a nationally disputed issue in Peru over recent years. The Tia Maria project was originally put on hold in 2011 after protests occurring around the area led to three deaths. In order to revive the project, Southern Copper   created a new environmental plan hoping to show that a cleaner mine was possible. The project was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/major-peru-mine-sparks-nationwide-protests-1431726237">again suspended</a> [WSJ report] a little over a week ago on May 15 due to the increasingly violent nature of the protests. The stalls have affected the nation's economy, as well as President <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/ollanta_humala/index.html">Ollanta Humala's</a> [NY Times news archive] approval ratings. A <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18700522">similar situation occurred</a> [BBC report] in the town of Celedin in 2012, when protests over the planned Minas Conga mine caused the deaths of three people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] on Saturday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50951#.VWIwjU9VhBd">expressed</a> [UN report] disappointment in the inability of Member States to reach an agreement on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, according to a UN spokesperson. The spokesperson released a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8661">statement</a> [press release] at the conclusion of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2015/">2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> [official website], where Member States discussed the treaty which is considered key to global nuclear disarmament. The spokesperson stated: <blockquote>[The Secretary General regretted that States parties were] unable to narrow their differences on the future of nuclear disarmament or to arrive at a new collective vision on how to achieve a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction... The Secretary-General appeals to all States to sustain the momentum they have built over the past five years, including new initiatives in the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and continuing efforts to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation.</blockquote> The Secretary General also warned of mounting tensions between States with nuclear arms and a return to Cold War era mindsets. He stated that he hopes the growing awareness of "the devastating humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons continues to compel urgent actions for effective measures leading to the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nuclear arms and energy continue to be a controversial topic around the world. In April The Fukui District Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/japan-court-blocks-restart-of-two-nuclear-reactors.php">issued an injunction</a> [JURIST report] halting the restart of two nuclear reactors is Takahama, Japan. The court ruled in favor of the locals that requested the injunction, citing the lack of credible evacuation measures and an underestimated earthquake risk. Also in April Iran <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/iran-agrees-to-framework-of-nuclear-deal.php">agreed in principle</a> [JURIST report] to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), creating significant restrictions on its controversial nuclear program for at least a decade in return for a reduction of international economic sanctions. In August 2014 the White House <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/white-house-announces-new-sanctions-on-30-groups-with-ties-to-iran.php">placed new sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on over 30 organizations and individuals with ties to Iran. The sanctions came as the US continued its negotiations with Iran regarding the future of its questionable nuclear program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> [official website] Special Coordinator Sigrid Kaag on Monday, <a href="http://unscol.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=9473&ctl=Details&mid=12484&ItemID=21065&language=en-US">urged </a>[press release] leaders in Lebanon to end their political divisions in order to pick a new president, warning that the year-long debate over the matter had "undermined Lebanon's ability to address the growing security, economic and social challenges facing the country." Monday <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN0OA0NA20150525">marks a year</a> [Reuters report] that the country has gone without a president, a significant period of time for the only Christian presidency in the Middle East to remain vacant, as lawmakers continue to struggle to come to an agreement on a suitable candidate. Kaag continued to implore the political leaders to place the needs of the country before their own political agendas, saying that "it has contributed to political polarization" at a time when "a sense of urgency is needed to resolve this issue." She concluded her remarks by praising Prime Minister Salam, who she said "has succeeded in upholding a unified Government despite enormous pressures and who has shown remarkable leadership in the face of increasingly difficult circumstances."</p>

<p>Because of its geographic position, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14647308">Lebanon</a> [BBC profile] has been implicated in much of the discord surrounding the Middle East region, including being one of the countries enumerated in the efforts by the <a href="/feature/2013/07/the-war-on-terror.php">war on terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In recent years, Lebanon has made a concerted effort to deviate and disapprove of the combative actions of its neighbors. In January of last year under the support of the UN backed <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> [official website; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/lebanon/tribunal/">backgrounder</a>], the country <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/lebanon-tribunal-opens-hariri-assassination-trial.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of four<a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=3101"> Hezbollah</a> [START backgrounder] members accused of executing a terrorist attack that killed a former Lebanese prime minister and 21 others. In April of last year the country <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/lebanon-parliament-passes-domestic-violence-law.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] criminalizing domestic violence after the deaths of multiple women that were said to be by the hands of their husbands. However, there are still strides to be made, as is evidenced by a declaration made in August by Lebanon's Minister of Justice calling for the "<a href="/paperchase/2014/08/lebanon-official-urges-punishment-for-isis-flag-burning.php">sternest punishment</a>" [JURIST report] to individuals who burned flags belonging to the militant group, <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State </a>[JURIST backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Rights groups on Monday criticized Myanmar's newly signed birth-spacing law, which requires some mothers to space the births of their children three years apart. The law, <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/myanmar-president-signs-restrictive-population-control-bill-into-law.php">signed </a>[JURIST report] by Myanmar President<a href="http://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/"> Thein Sein </a>[official website] on Saturday, was represented by the government as a healthcare bill intended to bring down maternal and infant mortality rates and is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/25/us-myanmar-birth-law-idUSKBN0OA0U420150525">supported </a>[Reuters report] by the Buddhist ultra-nationalist group the Committee for the Protection of Nationality and Religion (Ma Ba Tha). Rights groups now say, however, that the law will be used to target Myanmar's minority Muslim population. Yangon-based Triangle Women Support Group founder Khin Lay stated that the law "targets one religion, one population, in one area." Other groups, like Yangon-based women's rights group Pyi Gyi Khin, fear that the healthcare law could lead to increased tensions between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rakhine">Rakhine State</a> [JURIST news archive], with Pyi Gyi Khin founder Nwe Zin Win stating, "In the case of Rakhine specifically, it will only create misunderstanding between the two communities." Ma Ba Tha has caused increased concern among members of these groups through its expressed belief that Muslim communities have higher birthrates and will eventually overrun the country, thus stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. It remains unclear how this law will be enforced.</p>

<p>Myanmar has long been critiqued for its human rights situation. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International </a>(AI) and the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> (ICJ) [advocacy websites] in March <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/myanmar-urged-to-reject-proposed-legislation-on-religion-and-race.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] to reject or revise proposed laws they claim would "entrench already widespread discrimination and risk fueling further violence against religious minorities." Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-expert-raises-concerns-over-deteriorating-human-rights-in-myanmar.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] last April about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country's Rakhine State. In January of last year Quintana, along with the UN humanitarian chief, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-calls-for-probe-into-violence-in-myanmar.php#.U0La3lcS-CY">called for an immediate investigation</a> [JURIST report] by authorities following reports of alarming levels of violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state. In October 2013 Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-conflict-in-rakhine-continues-to-inspire-sectarian-violence-in-myanmar.php#.U0LcJFcS-CY">warned </a>[JURIST report] that sectarian violence between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State was contributing to wider anti-Muslim sentiments in Myanmar, threatening the positive changes undertaken by the country in the past two years. While Quintana acknowledged that Myanmar's government has demonstrated willingness to address the situation, he expressed concern that discriminatory acts against Muslims remain unattended. Earlier that month Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-welcomes-myanmars-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php#.U0LcQlcS-CY">welcomed </a>[JURIST report] the release of 56 prisoners of conscience in Myanmar, although he stressed the need for legislative reforms that would address the injustice against prisoners of conscience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three Yemeni officials on Sunday said they were notified that the UN-sponsored peace conference designed to establish peace in Yemen has been indefinitely postponed. The conference was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/talks-yemen-conflict-postponed-150525021958530.html">scheduled to begin</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] on Thursday, and no new date has been set. Sultan al-Atwani, an aide to exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, stated that the talks were "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/25/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0O904A20150525">postponed</a> because the Houthis did not indicate their commitment to implement the Security Council resolution," [Reuters report]. He also said that intensified fighting in Aden, Taiz, Dalea and Shabwa make it difficult and dangerous to go to Geneva. The postponement of these talks, which were intended to end weeks of heavy fighting and airstrikes, has been a heavy blow to efforts to end the fighting in the region. The postponement was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/yemeni-politicians-un-peace-talks-indefinitely-postponed-074058221.html">confirmed </a>[AP report] by a UN official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and thus made the statement under the condition of anonymity. </p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">archive</a>] has sparked significant international concern. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/"></a>Human Rights Watch (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php">targeting</a> [JURIST report] of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen by combatants. Also last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">urged Yemeni combatants</a> [JURIST report] to report attacks resulting in civilian casualties so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the<a href="http://www.cair.com/"> Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Earlier in April, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] [JURIST] A Bangladeshi police official on Monday said that Bangladeshi police have arrested two suspected members of the<a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/detail.php"> Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] on suspicion that the pair were planning to fight for IS in Syria. According to Sheikh Nazmul Alam, a senior official of the police detective branch, the men were <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/25/uk-bangladesh-islamic-state-arrest-idUKKBN0OA0EY20150525">detained </a>[Reuters report] in Dhaka on Sunday night during a raid of the city. One man, Aminul Islam Baig, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/25/us-bangladesh-islamic-state-arrest-idUSKBN0OA0D420150525">was an IT manager</a> [Reuters report] at International Beverages Private Ltd, a subsidiary of Coca-Cola Co. He also served as a regional coordinator for IS. The other, Sakib bin Kamal, was a school teacher in Dhaka. Alam stated that the two have admitted to having persuaded at least 25 students to join IS. The men also provided a list with the names of 20 accomplices who had been assisting them in their attempts to recruit more young members for IS. According to another police spokesperson, Monirul Islam, the men will <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/two-arrested-in/1871024.html">soon be produced</a> [AFP report] before a court and the police plan to "seek remand for further interrogation."</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has caused increasing international alarm over its human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">abuses </a>[JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. In April chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court Fatou Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/icc-prosecutor-formal-probe-into-islamic-state-unlikely.php">said </a>[JURIST report] that although IS has been accused of widespread atrocities throughout Iraq and Syra, her office lacks jurisdiction to open a formal investigation into the group. In March the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported that the actions of IS in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">may amount to genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and war crimes. In February the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">jointly released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. Bensouda stated in November that the ICC was contemplating bringing war crimes charges against IS jihadist fighters</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> [official website] correspondent Jason Rezaian's <a href="http://www.irna.ir/en/News/81622917/">trial began</a> [IRNA report] on Tuesday in Tehran's Islamic Revolutionary Court with a hearing that was closed to the public. Rezaian, a US-Iranian dual citizen has been detained in Iran for 10 months on charges of espionage and giving information to hostile governments. He was originally arrested without charges and held in the notorious <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/01/28/inside-evin-look-at-world-most-notorious-political-prison/">Evin Prison</a> [Fox News backgrounder] in solitary confinement for the duration of his imprisonment, and allegedly Iran has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/26/us-iran-usa-journalist-idUSKBN0OA1K120150526">presented no evidence</a> [Reuters report] to support the charges. <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/postbaron">Executive Editor Martin Baron</a> [official Twitter account] released a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2015/05/25/new-statement-from-martin-baron-ahead-of-jason-rezaians-trial-in-iran/">statement</a> [press release] regarding Rezaian's trial, in which he condemned Iran's actions: "There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance. Iran is making a statement about its values in its disgraceful treatment of our colleague, and it can only horrify the world community." Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi and an unidentified photographer were <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-post-reporter-goes-on-trial-in-iran-for-espionage-1432635321">arrested</a> [WSJ report] in July, and all three appeared in court on similar charges on Tuesday. Rezaian faces 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Rezaian's case remains particularly sensitive as it <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32879675">falls in the midst</a> [BBC report] of Iran's ongoing nuclear negotiations with the West. President Obama has urged Iran to release Rezaian and other American detainees to no avail. Rezaian's trial looms before the nuclear negotiation's June 30 deadline. Iran has <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/iran-agrees-to-framework-of-nuclear-deal.php">agreed to a preliminary framework</a> [JURIST report] of nuclear restrictions in exchange for gradual lifting of international economic sanctions in a deal struck with five major world powers including the US. While this agreement is not final, the US remains optimistic that it remains a "solid foundation for the good deal [the nations] are seeking."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Tuesday ordered Serbia's justice ministry to return <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Seselj">Vojislav Seselj</a> [JURIST news archive], ailing alleged war criminal, to his detention cell immediately. Seselj had been held in The Hague on charges of leading ethnic Serbs to persecute non-Serbs during the Croatia and Bosnia wars in the 1990s but was released last month to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. Seselj has pleaded not guilty on nine counts including murder and torture. The ICTY had <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">revoked his provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March, because Seselj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to The Hague. The ICTY's request for his return will now be <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/un-court-orders-serbia-send-seselj-back-cell-112450276.html">reviewed by the Serbian government</a> [AFP report].</p>

<p>In February JURIST Guest Columnist Gregory Gordon of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law discussed the ICTY's decision to grant provisional release to Seselj and its <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">repercussions</a> [JURIST op-ed] on international criminal law and transitional justice. The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">ICTY</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced. In December police in Bosnia and Serbia <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/police-in-serbia-and-bosnia-arrest-15-individuals-for-role-in-balkan-war-massacre.php">arrested 15 individuals</a> [JURIST report] accused of perpetrating the massacre of 19 unarmed men during the height of the Balkan conflict. The investigation has identified Bosnian Serb warlord <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/cis/en/cis_lukic_lukic_en.pdf">Milan Lukic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF] as the mastermind of the massacre. The trial for Seselj <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/serb-nationalist-leader-on-trial-at.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, after he was charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes, and accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict. In January 2012 Seselj <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icty-war-crimes-suspect-demands-compensation-for-trial-delays.php">sued the ICTY</a> [JURIST report] for USD $2.6 million in damages due to alleged unreasonable delays in his trial, alleging that the tribunal failed to give him materials in Serbian; denied him communication with family members, doctors and legal counsel; delayed his trial interminably and refused him a right to his own independent counsel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] agreed Tuesday to rule in a major voter equality case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/052615zor_2co3.pdf">noting jurisdiction</a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-940.htm">Evenwel v. Abbott</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14-940-js-pet.pdf">jurisdictional statement</a>, PDF]. The question presented is: "whether the 'one-person, one-vote' principle of the Fourteenth Amendment creates a judicially enforceable right ensuring that the districting process does not deny voters an equal vote." The case concerns Texas' redistricting scheme. A three-judge panel for the US District Court for the Western District of Texas <a href="http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/evenwelperry.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] the voters' claims that their votes would count less than if they were in other districts.</p>

<p>The court also granted <em>certiorari</em> in two cases Tuesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-8349.htm">Foster v. Humphrey</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015.01.30-Foster-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide whether the "Georgia courts err[ed] in failing to recognize race discrimination ... in the extraordinary circumstances of this death penalty case." The case involves a black defendant and a white victim. The state of Georgia struck all four black prospective jurors, and the prosecution's notes later revealed that the prospective jurors had been identified and labeled as black. The Georgia courts found no race discrimination.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-8358.htm">Lockhart v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14-8358-pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252">18 USC § 2252(b)(2)</a> [text], which requires a district court to impose a prison term of at least 10 years on a defendant convicted of possessing child pornography if he "has a prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward." The question presented is: "whether § 2252(b)(2)'s mandatory minimum sentence is triggered by a prior conviction under a state law relating to 'aggravated sexual abuse' or 'sexual abuse,' even though the conviction did not "involv[e] a minor or ward.'" The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found "that § 2252(b)(2) does not require that a prior state‐law aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse conviction involve a minor." There is a circuit split on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/12-1497_2d8f.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kellogg-brown-root-services-inc-v-united-states-ex-rel-carter/">Kellogg Brown & Root Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Carter</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3287">Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act</a> (WSLA) [18 USC § 3287] applies only to criminal offenses, and that its first-to-file bars claims related to others already filed only as long as the related claims are alive. The WSLA suspends "the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense" involving fraud against the federal government at times of war. Previously undecided was how narrowly the WSLA was to be interpreted, specifically whether it applied to both civil and criminal law, or only criminal. In 2005, Benjamin Carter, formerly an employee of contracting firm <a href="http://www.kbr.com/">Kellogg Brown & Root</a> (KBR), filed a <em>qui tam</em> action against his former employer for making a fraudulent claim for payment to the United States. Carter's first two complaints were dismissed as barred by first-to-file, as other such claims were already made. Upon dismissal of those claims, Carter filed a third time in 2011, but was barred by the statute of limitations, as such an action must generally be brought within six years of the violation. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1625873.html">held</a> [opinion] that the WSLA applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ended when related claims ceased. The Supreme Court reversed in part and affirmed in part, ruling that the statute of limitations on Carter's claims was not tolled by the WSLA. Reviewing the structure, text and history of the act, the Supreme Court held that the WSLA applies only to criminal offenses. The court further held that the first-to-file bar only prevents claims that relate to other active claims, but does not bar claims that relate to other claims already dismissed. Thus, although Carter's third claim was not barred by first-to-file, it was barred by the statute of limitations as the WSLA does not apply. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/supreme-court-to-rule-on-pregnant-workers-rights.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in July. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-eeoc-false-claims-act.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in January on the <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2014/2014_12_1497">questions</a> [OYEZ report]: "does the first-to-file requirement act as a once-case-at-a-time rule, allowing as many related claims to be filed as long as no prior claim is pending?" and "can the Wartime Enforcement of Fraud's statute of limitations tolling provision be applied to civil claims brought by private citizens?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cisco Systems, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a "good faith" belief of a patent's invalidity is not a defense to a claim of induced patent infringement under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">35 USC §271(b)</a> [text]. Commil USA, which holds a patent for technology that allows wireless devices to move easily from point to point on a wifi network, brought claims of patent infringement against Cisco Systems. The court rejected Cisco's claim that a sincere belief that a patent was not valid negates the intent requirement necessary for induced patent infringement as unworkable because the prohibitory statute applies the <em>mens rea</em> requirement to the act of infringement, and not to its validity. Therefore, "[w]hen infringement is the issue, the validity of the patent is not the question to be confronted." In disallowing a good faith defense, the court reaffirmed the protections granted to patent holders against litigation brought by competing companies that would seek to infringe based on supposed sincere beliefs. </p>

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-patent-disputes.php"> [JURIST report] oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] for this case in late March. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-specialty-license-plates.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/LeilaniFarha.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16007&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] Tuesday on the Serbian government to take immediate action to improve the current housing crisis that has left many Serbian citizens without adequate housing. While Serbia boasts a high rate of homeownership due to the privatization and sale of public housing stock in the 1990s, homeowners and renters reportedly suffer from inadequate living arrangements. The special rapporteur noted that both groups have "indicated that heating, electricity bills and other housing charges are simply unaffordable," while renters are being evicted for being in arrears. The UN sees it as imperative that the government implement national regulations controlling the availability, affordability and security of tenure in housing for all. However, the report noted the current discriminatory and exclusionary methods taken against marginalized groups, most notably the Roma, and stressed that any legislation enacted should be made with an eye towards human rights and the equal protection of all groups present in the nation. </p>

<p>The Serbian government has often been appealed to by the UN and other rights groups to improve their adherence to human rights tenets. In 2011 <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-serbia-to-halt-roma-evictions.php">entreated</a> [JURIST report] the Serbian government to stop the forced eviction of Roma, and to provide them with adequate housing and compensation. In 2012 the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-un-high-commissioner-for-1.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Serbia to protect universal freedoms by lifting a ban on a pride parade for the LGBT community. Last month Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-asylum-seekers-suffering-abuse-at-hands-of-serbia-police.php">criticizing</a> [JURIST repot] the alleged extortion and physical abuse inflicted by Serbian authorities on asylum-seekers and migrants escaping war-torn countries.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Tuesday announced a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/file/441426/download">settlement</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-agreement-city-cleveland-reform-cleveland-division-police">press release</a>] with the Cleveland police department, which has agreed to adopt stringent standards over how and when its officers can use force. The results of a <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/doj-investigation-into-cleveland-police-finds-pattern-of-excessive-force.php">DOJ investigation</a> [JURIST report] announced in December found a pattern of "unreasonable and unnecessary use of force." The DOJ found that the department used stun guns inappropriately in addition to punching and kicking unarmed persons and shooting at people who were harmless. Investigators discovered that several of these allegations either went unreported or uninvestigated. Under the new rules, Cleveland has agreed to document each time its officers decide to unholster their guns, and officers will be prohibited from using force against people for talking back or as punishment for trying to escape. Furthermore, pistol whipping and warning shots will also be disallowed under the new rules. Should the city refuse to put these changes into effect, a federal judge has the authority to demand that the changes be enforced. The federal authorities are hopeful that these changes will guarantee that police conduct proper investigations and keep accurate records.</p>

<p>Police use of force has been a controversial issue across the US recently. Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] l<a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-attorney-general-announces-investigation-into-baltimore-police.php">aunched a federal civil rights investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Baltimore's police following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict </a>[JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who last year<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/"> shot and killed Micheal Brown</a> [USA Today Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with<a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php"> AI reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-935_8mj9.pdf">ruled </a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/wellness-international-network-limited-v-sharif/">Wellness International Network Ltd. v. Sharif</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that bankruptcy judges have the power to make final judgments in certain legal disputes. In so ruling the Supreme Court reversed and remanded an appellate court decision finding that the bankruptcy court did not have the required constitutional authority to decide whether certain property belonged to the bankruptcy estate because the dispute also involved state laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the majority opinion, which was joined by four justices, with Justice Samuel Alito joining in part, while Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented. The 6-3 ruling declared that if all involved parties consent, then the country's nearly 1,000 bankruptcy judges can make final decisions on legal issues that arise in bankruptcy cases. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has issued several rulings on bankruptcy issues in recent years. Earlier this month the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/supreme-court-rules-in-bankruptcy-case.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that a debtor who converts to Chapter 7 is entitled to return any post-petition wages not yet distributed by the Chapter 13 trustee. In 2011 the Supreme Court held in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-179.pdf">Stern v. Marshall</a> [opinion, PDF] that bankruptcy judges only have the power to make a final ruling on a dispute that "stems from the bankruptcy itself." The court ruled that other issues must be decided by the district court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nebraska on Wednesday became the first Republican-controlled state to <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/104/PDF/Final/LB268.pdf">repeal the death penalty</a> [Bill 268, PDF] since 1973. <a href="http://www.petericketts.com">Governor Pete Ricketts</a> [official campaign website] vetoed the bill on Tuesday, but after a vote Wednesday afternoon, the state <a href="http://update.legislature.ne.gov/?p=17671">officially repealed capital punishment</a> [press release]. A sentence of life without parole will replace the previous sentence of capital punishment. Although the last execution was in 1997, the 10 inmates currently on death row may still be executed as scheduled, as the law is prospective not retroactive. Ricketts claimed that his support of the death penalty was founded in public welfare, namely, keeping dangerous criminals off the streets. However, a life sentence without parole will have the same effect, as it entails the prisoner living out their remaining days while incarcerated.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">Lethal injection</a> [JURIST news archive] and execution methods have been at the forefront of the death penalty debate for the past few years. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-oklahoma-lethal-injection-procedure.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam. Also in April the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty, but the legislation includes an exemption for the 15 inmates currently on Delaware's death row. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of appeals judges for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1976613.pdf">affirmed a ruling</a> [judgment, PDF] that allows a case against former Ivory Coast first lady <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/icc0211/related%20cases/icc02110112/Pages/index.aspx">Simone Gbagbo</a> [ICC case materials] to go forward to trial. Gbagbo is accused of multiple crimes against humanity including murder and rape, which allegedly occurred after the country's debated 2010 elections that resulted in 3,000 deaths. Her husband, Laurent Gbagbo, the former incumbent president, refused to step down from office after <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC backgrounder] was declared the winner of the 2010 election, which sparked the months-long conflict. The judges allowed the case to go forward in part because it involves occurrences distinct from those which led to her 20-year sentence in March.</p>

<p>Simone Gbagbo plans to appeal her 20-year sentence on charges involving <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/ivory-coast-former-first-lady-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison.php">undermining state security</a> [JURIST report] after the post-election violence in 2010. She was also accused of organizing armed gangs and disturbing the public order. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">unsealed</a> [JURIST report] an arrest warrant for Simone Gbagbo for crimes against humanity during the post-election violence, but the Ivory Coast opted to try her domestically.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/articles/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/">accused</a> [press release] Hamas forces of leading a series of abductions, torturous acts and unlawful killings against Palestinians. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde21/1643/2015/en/">report</a> [report] documents the human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings often condoned by largely unaccountable Hamas authorities. Director of the Middle East and North Africa Program, Philip Luther, stated:<blockquote>In the chaos of the conflict, the de facto Hamas administration granted its security forces free rein to carry out horrific abuses including against people in its custody. These spine-chilling actions, some of which amount to war crimes, were designed to exact revenge and spread fear across the Gaza Strip.</blockquote>The watchdog group characterized this series of actions as a "brutal campaign" against the law of humanity and called on Palestinian authorities, including the Hamas de facto administration in Gaza, to cooperate with current and future international investigative efforts and to document future human rights abuses in order to ensure justice is served.</p>

<p>The conflict between <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel">Israel</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=palestine">Palestine</a> [JURIST news archives] has lasted for years and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7812290.stm">caused</a> [BBC timeline] numerous casualties on both sides. In March the <a href="http://israellawcenter.org">Israel Law Center</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/israel-law-center-petitions-doj-to-prosecute-hamas.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] to the US Department of Justice to prosecute several Hamas leaders for their involvement in the attack on Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport last summer, which lead to the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Following the 2014 attack, the UN was compelled to institute a <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-names-experts-to-gaza-war-crimes-panel.php">commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations. In January the Israel Law Center filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/israel-based-rights-group-files-war-crimes-complaint-with-icc-against-palestinians.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ICC, accusing Palestinian leaders of war crimes including torture, terrorism and civil rights violations. In December AI declared that Israel's <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/amnesty-israel-attacks-on-gaza-landmark-buildings-were-war-crimes.php">air-strikes</a> [JURIST report] on landmark buildings in Gaza were deliberate war crimes that led to the injury of many civilians. In September the Israel Law Center asked the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">open an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into war crimes allegedly committed by Hamas leader, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20623504">Khaled Meshaal</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/15/05/141891P.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] abortion restrictions in Arkansas, ruling that the 12-week limit on seeking an abortion places an unconstitutional burden on women within the state. The restrictions included tests to determine if there was a detectible heartbeat, prohibition of abortions after 12 weeks of gestation, and informed disclosures of the existence of a heartbeat as well as the probability of bringing the fetus to term. Plaintiffs in the case argued that a fetus is not viable until 24 weeks' gestation, and thus, the court held that regulations inhibiting a woman from undergoing an abortion before that time limit places an undue burden on a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy before viability. "A regulation is an undue burden if it has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."</p>

<p>Abortion waiting periods and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have been heated topics throughout the US. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website] signed House Bill 1409 into law <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/oklahoma-governor-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period.php">extending the mandatory</a> [JURIST report] waiting period for women seeking an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Also in April Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women that they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion, in addition to barring women from buying any healthcare plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">West Virginia Legislature overrode</a> [JURIST report] the state governor's veto, passing a bill that bans abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/15/15-40238-CV0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the injunction against President Barack Obama's recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">executive action on immigration</a> [official website] should remain in effect pending appeal. Many of the initiatives, which would have provided relief from deportation to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants, were set to begin this month. Instead, in February, Judge Andrew Hanen of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1668197-hanen-opinion.html">granted an injunction</a> [opinion] to a Texas-led 26-state coalition, <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-blocks-obamas-executive-action-on-immigration.php">determining</a> [JURIST report] that difficulty of enforcement was no excuse to shirk the requirements of the law. The Obama administration appealed the ruling, and separately requested that the injunction be removed while the appeal is pending. In an opinion written by Judge Jerry Smith, the Fifth Circuit upheld the injunction for the duration of the appeal, recognizing the states' standing to bring the suit as well as rejecting an argument by the administration to limit the injunction to the states involved in the suit. A different panel of judges on the Fifth Circuit will hear argument on the appeal of the greater case later this year. </p>

<p>Last month the same district court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/texas-federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-blocking-presidents-immigration-action.php">declined to lift</a> [JURIST report] the February order blocking the executive actions. In November Obama announced two new <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">immigration programs</a> [text], purportedly under his executive authority as president. The <a href="http://www.ice.gov/daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and <a href="http://www.nilc.org/dapa&daca.html">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) would lift the threat of deportation for about 4.7 million undocumented residents by allowing immigrants that have been in the US for more than five years or have children who are citizens to register and pass a criminal background check in order to stay in the country. In March the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-urges-appeals-court-to-reverse-ruling-on-immigrant-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Fifth Circuit to reverse the injunction blocking the president's immigration executive action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Madagascar's Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13861845">President Hery Rajaonarimampianina</a> [BBC profile] from office for failing to deliver on promises. The parliament also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32897313">alleged</a> [BBC report] Rajaonarimampianina has violated the constitution, lacks respect for the government, and that he did not rule out the possibility of dissolving parliament. Rajaonarimampianina was elected in 2013, four years after his predecessor, Marc Ravalomanana was ousted in a coup. The impeachment vote, which requires a two-thirds majority, had 121 of the 125 members present vote to impeach the president and the motion will be reviewed by the country's constitutional court. Rajaonarimampianina <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/madagascan-president-address-nation-impeachment-vote-105011359.html">challenged</a> [AFP report] the vote on Wednesday, expressing concern for due process. He claims that although 125 votes were recorded, only 80 members were present on Tuesday and suspects corruption in the parliament. </p>

<p>Political unrest has plagued Madagascar for quite some time, as the country has a long history of conflicts and coups. The former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1866530.stm">Ravalomanana</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/madagascar-former-president-arrested-upon-return-to-country.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] last October when he returned to the country after five years of living in exile in South Africa but was freed in May. In August 2012 South African prosecutors began <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-africa-prosecutors-investigating-former-madagascar-president.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Ravalomanana for possible crimes against humanity. A spokeswoman for Ravalomanana stated that she believed the allegations were politically motivated. In March 2012 a Madagascar court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/former-icj-judge-on-trial-for-madagascar-coup-plot.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former International Court of Justice Judge Raymond Ranjeva who was accused of planning an attempted coup in the country. The judge was later acquitted. In November 2010 there was an <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/madagascar-faces-coup-attempt-during-constitutional-referendum.php">attempted coup</a> during a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/madagascar-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://ksrk.gov.kz/eng/index.php">Kazakhstan's Constitutional Council</a> [official website] on Wednesday declared unconstitutional a bill seeking to ban the dissemination to minors of information supporting homosexual relationships. The council <a href="http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/kazakhstan-constitutional-council-invalidates-russian-style-anti-lgbt-bill">found</a> [HRC press release] the bill contained poor wording and incorrect formulation, according to <a href="http://www.hrc.org">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website], but it could be reintroduced in the future. Many believe Kazakhstan's bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Almaty may be a reason for the ruling, as many prominent athletes in the country spoke up against the law. </p>

<p>Russia passed a similar controversial law, originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in March 2012. In June 2012 prominent Russian gay rights activist Nikolai Alekeyev filed a complaint with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] challenging a similar St. Petersburg city ordinance <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/russia-gay-rights-activist-challenges-homosexual-propaganda-law.php">prohibiting</a> [JURIST report] the spreading "homosexual propaganda" to minors. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/CRCIndex.aspx">UN Committee on the Rights of the Child</a> (CRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-urges-russia-to-repeal-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Russian government in February 2014 to repeal the legislation banning the dissemination of homosexual "propaganda" to minors. Last September the <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/en/Info/Pages/default.aspx">Constitutional Court of Russia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/russia-high-court-upholds-ban-on-homosexual-propaganda.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law banning "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations" among minors is not in breach of the <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Russia_2014?lang=en">Russian Constitution</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://cms.inatsisartut.gl/forside.aspx?lang=en&alttemplate=International">Parliament of Greenland</a> [official website] voted Wednesday to enact laws that will legalize same-sex marriage and allow for same-sex couples to participate in adoption. The new marriage law, which passed with unanimous support, reforms previous legislation enacted in 1989 that <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/greenland-adopts-same-sex-marriage">allowed</a> [LifeSiteNews report] for same-sex "civil partnerships." The new Greenland laws are expected to go into effect in October. </p>

<p>Same-sex couples have varied marriage rights throughout the world. Last week Ireland became the first country to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/ireland-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-by-national-referendum.php">legalize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage by national referendum. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> to rule on same-sex marriage, granting <em>certiorari</em> in four separate cases, and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] on one case in late April. A decision is expected by the end of June. In August Ugandan Attorney General Peter Nyomb <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal against the constitutional court ruling that struck down the nation's anti-homosexuality law. Last January the Nigerian president <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, banning same-sex marriage and criminalizing same-sex relationships. Similar laws exist in <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">Singapore</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-condemns-lgbt-discrimination-in-jamaica.php">Jamaica</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US prosecutors on Wednesday <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/450211/download">charged</a> [indictment, PdF] 14 top <a href="http://www.fifa.com/">FIFA</a> [official website] officials with offenses including racketeering, money laundering and bribery, alleging that the men used partnerships with sports marketing executives to solicit more than $150 million in bribes and kickbacks to support various sites of FIFA <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">World Cup</a> [official website] events. The prosecutors claim that at least some of the defendants, nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives, have participated in the scheme to enrich themselves for over two decades. As soccer officials from around the world met in Zurich this week to attend the annual <a href="http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/fifa-congress/index.html">FIFA Congress</a> [official website], authorities in Switzerland arrested seven of the defendants. Federal investigators were also searching for defendants at the <a href="http://www.concacaf.com/">CONCACAF</a> [official website] headquarters in Miami. The seven arrested in Switzerland, including FIFA Vice President and CONCACAF President <a href="http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/committees/people=36868/index.html">Jeffrey Webb</a> [official profile], may face extradition to the US on federal corruption charges. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official profile] remarked in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and">statement</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States. ... [I]t has profoundly harmed a multitude of victims, from the youth leagues and developing countries that should benefit from the revenue generated by the commercial rights these organizations hold, to the fans at home and throughout the world. ... Today's action makes clear that this Department of Justice intends to end any such corrupt practices, to root out misconduct, and to bring wrongdoers to justice.</blockquote>According to Switzerland's <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/en/home.html">Federal Office of Justice</a> (FOJ) [official website] the arrests were made at the request of American legal authorities following an investigation by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/">US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website].</p>

<p>FIFA has long been accused of corruption, but this is the largest case ever assembled against the organization in regards to those types of allegations. FBI Director <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/executives/comey">James Comey</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/05/27/fifa-officials-arrested-corruption-charges-extradition-united-states/27997783/">stated</a> [USA Today Report], "Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA." <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/fifa-scandal-explained/">An issue</a> [Wired report] with the organization is that in its voting for a president and executive committee, each of the 209 member nations gets a single vote. Also, each country receives an equal share of FIFA's revenues. Therefore, there is less incentive for the smaller, poorer countries to attempt to change any of the structure to the voting process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for Spain's National Court on Thursday opened a probe into Nigerian Islamist militant group Boko Haram for terrorism and crimes against humanity over a 2013 attack on a Nigerian town in which a Spanish nun was assaulted. Spain's universal jurisdiction laws allow crimes against humanity to be prosecuted across borders as long as there is a connection to Spain. A militant attack on the eastern Nigerian town of Ganye on March 22, 2013, in which 25 people were killed, gave rise to the Boko Haram case. <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/05/28/actualidad/1432813954_976483.html">Court papers said</a> [<em>El País</em> report, in Spanish] that Maria Jesus Mayor, a nun from Ganye, was assaulted by militants before she was able to escape into hiding and was later rescued by Nigerian security services. The judge has requested a study of Boko Haram from Interpol and will question Mayor about the incident.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boko+haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC profile], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. In April <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that Boko Haram had <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-boko-haram-has-arrested-at-least-2000-women-since-2014.php">abducted at least 2,000 women and girls</a> [JURIST report] in Nigeria since the start of 2014 and gave details of the extreme violence and crimes against humanity committed by the group. Also in April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, reported that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">murdering women and girls</a> [JURIST report] previously taken captive by the group.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/">New York Assembly</a> [official website] voted 89-47 on Wednesday in favor of <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=A05062&term=2015&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Votes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Yundefined&utm_source=Press+Release+-+NYH+passage&utm_campaign=5-27-15+NYH&utm_medium=email">legislation</a> [A05062 materials] establishing publicly funded universal health coverage in which all New York residents may enroll. Supporters of the legislation said that the coverage would be <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/state/index.ssf/2015/05/ny_assembly_votes_for_universal_health_coverage.html">extended to the uninsured</a> [AP report] and costs would be reduced by not involving insurance companies. New York Health would pay providers through collectively negotiated rates and patient premiums, deductibles or co-payments for hospital and doctor visits, testing, drugs or other care would be eliminated. The universal health coverage plan would be funded through a progressive payroll tax paid 80 percent by employers and 20 percent by employees. However, Senate Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon said that "the bill still faces two major hurdles, resistance from senior citizens to giving up Medicare for a new state program and obtaining federal waivers to apply Medicaid and Medicare funding to support it."</p>

<p>Federal <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform</a> [JURIST feature] has caused continued debate and legal action since it was passed in 2010. In March the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-turns-away-latest-health-care-challenge.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's Independent Payment Advisory Board provision. Earlier in March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral arguments for <span class="casename">King v. Burwell</span> in which the court has been asked to rule on whether the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> [official website] may adopt regulations to extend tax-credit subsidies to coverage purchased through the federal health insurance exchange established under the ACA. Last June the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that closely held corporations can deny contraceptive coverage to their employees for religious reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Bangkok Criminal Court on Thursday convicted two members of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268">People's Alliance for Democracy Network</a> [BBC backgrounder], known as "Yellow Shirts," for their roles in breaking into the Prime Minster's office during the 2008 protests. The court found Yellow Shirt movement founder and Thai media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul and Chamlong Srimuang guilty of trespassing. Sondhi was previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/thailand-court-convicts-yellow-shirt-leader-of-corporate-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 to 20 years in prison without parole for violating the Securities and Exchange Act by fraudulently securing a loan for 1.1 billion baht (USD $36 million) during the 1990s. Currently, Sondhi and other Yellow Shirt members still have pending cases in relation to additional terrorism charges. The two Yellow Shirt members convicted of trespassing may still <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/world/southeast-asia/thailands-yellow-shirt-leaders-sentenced-for-2008-protest">appeal</a> [AFP report] but have been banned from traveling overseas. </p>

<p>Thailand has continued to see protests and upheaval. The military took control of the Thai government after a coup in May 2014, overthrowing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Martial law was instituted on May 20, two days before the <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] that ousted the former Thai government and installed <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">General Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] as the country's new prime minister. A group of Thai human rights activists <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to the country's state of martial law in September. The previous month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-human-rights-office-claims-thailand-laws-limit-free-expression.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] that the prosecution and sentencing of lese majeste cases by Thailand's ruling military junta threaten citizens' rights of free expression. Last June a group of independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-urge-thailand-to-address-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thai authorities to reverse all measures affecting basic human rights and to restore democratic rule in the country. Shortly after the coup last May, the Thai military released <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thai-military-government-seeks-to-restrict-dissent-limit-protests.php">several statements</a> [JURIST report] banning meetings of more than five people and imposing nightly curfews. Prayuth announced in April that the country's military government would <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/thailand-pm-announces-end-to-martial-law-after-10-months.php">lift martial law</a> [JURIST report] and replace it with a new security order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Czech court in Prague acquitted the wife of former Czech prime minister Petr Necas of charges of abusing military intelligence. Jana Necasova, formerly Jana Nagyova, allegedly used military intelligence to spy on Necas's former wife when Necasova served as the prime minister's aide in 2012. A judge for the District Court in Prague <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/wife-czech-pm-acquitted-court-abuse-power-31384619">ruled</a> [AP report] that Necasova did not act criminally but failed to elaborate on the ruling because of classified information. The court also acquitted three intelligence agents who were charged with ordering the spying, and prosecutors immediately filed an appeal. Necasova was previously <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3102335/Czech-court-clears-ex-PMs-aide-scandal-toppled-government.html">found guilty</a> [Reuters report] and given a suspended sentence of one year, but her lawyer appealed that decision. </p>

<p>Former prime minister Petr Necas resigned in June 2013 after the exposure of a widespread corruption scandal, including an affair with Necasova. Necas <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/prague-court-acquits-femme-fatale-toppled-czech-pm-115838454.html">divorced</a> [AFP report] his wife of over 25 years in August 2013 and married Necasova shortly afterward. Widespread investigations followed, focusing on members of parliament and businessmen. The <a href="http://www.nsoud.cz/JudikaturaNS_new/ns_web.nsf?openDatabase&lng=EN">Czech Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in November 2013 that Necas was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/czech-high-court-rules-former-pm-not-entitled-to-legal-immunity.php">not entitled to immunity</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution and could could face corruption charges. The election that followed put the Social Democrats back in power in the Czech Republic, and Necas's own party, the Civic Democratic Party, has struggled to secure votes in elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] North Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website] vetoed <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Applications/Dashboard/Chamber/Services/BillSummary.aspx?sSessionCode=2015&sBarcode=S2-SMST-93(e2)">legislation</a> [SB 2 summary] Thursday that would allow officials to avoid performing same-sex marriages. The bill, which would permit court officials and magistrates to avoid any marriage duties if they have a sincere religious objection, was passed on Thursday by both houses. A three-fifths majority vote in the legislature is required to override the veto. McCrory released a <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20150528/governor-mccrory-defends-constitution">statement</a> [press release] saying that "No public official who voluntarily swears to support and defend the Constitution and to discharge all duties of their office should be exempt from upholding that oath; therefore, I will veto Senate Bill 2."</p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, as well as freedom of religious practice, remain controversial issues in the US. Nineteen states have enacted some variety of religious freedom laws, most modeled after the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993. In Louisiana, the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/louisiana-governor-issues-executive-order-after-religious-objections-bill-defeated.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a religious objections bill earlier this month that was pushed by <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/">Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website]. In April <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm">Indiana Governor Mike Pence</a> [official website] signed into law an amended version of the controversial <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/101#document-92bab197">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text], which critics argued gave business owners the legal right to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-arkansas-governors-sign-amended-religious-freedom-bills.php">deny</a> [JURIST report] service based on sexual orientation. Pence signed Indiana's original controversial version into law after the state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill by a 40-10 vote. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Thursday acquitted a policeman convicted of torturing an Islamist to death over a church bombing. Mohammed Abdel Rahman al-Shimi was sentenced to 15 years in prison in June 2012 for taking part in the torturing of Sayed Bilal until he was dead. On appeal the verdict was overturned, and the retrial that resulted in Thursday's verdict was ordered. The bombing occurred a few weeks before the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder] against then-ruler <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] when a suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a church outside Alexandria, killing more than 20 people. Police responded and arrested protesting Islamists, including Bilal. He was then tortured to death by al-Shimi and others, and his badly bruised body was returned to his family the next day. Police abuses were a major catalyst for the 2011 uprising, and such abuses have reduced drastically after Mubarak's successor, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile], was ousted by now President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] in July 2013. </p>

<p>Egypt has faced a great deal of unrest and turmoil since the 2011 uprising, including a great deal of tension with the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>]. Earlier this month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced ex-president Morsi</a> [JURIST report] and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. Morsi was accused of conspiring with foreign militants to free Islamists during the mass prison breaks. Also in May the Cairo criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-mubarak-to-three-years-in-prison.php">sentenced former president Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and his two sons to three years in prison on corruption charges. However, Mubarak and his sons had already spent three years in prison for other convictions, so they will most likely not have to serve out this three year sentence. In March an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-upholds-police-officers-sentence-for-killing-activist.php">upheld a 10-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for two police officers who were convicted for torturing activist Khaled Said to death in 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vladimir Katriuk, an elite Nazi storm trooper and the second most wanted man on the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=8776547&ct=14583557">Simon Wiesenthal Center's list</a> [materials] died Thursday at the age of 93. Katriuk passed away after battling a long illness, according to his lawyer. It is alleged that Katriuk, a Ukrainian national, was a key participant in a massacre in what is now Belarus that occurred during the Second World War. He allegedly waited outside a burning building with a machine gun and shot civilians fleeing the building. After his participation he moved to France and finally settled in Canada with his fFench wife. In 1999 Canada's federal court ruled that he had obtained citizenship under false pretense, but no evidence was found. In 2007 the court decided not revoke his citizenship. Russia had been seeking Katriuk's <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/russia-seeks-extradition-of-ex-ukrainian-alleged-nazi-war-criminal/article24354223/">extradition</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report].</p>

<p>Nazis and their supporters have continued to be prosecuted regardless of their age. In February a German court said that a 93-year-old man dubbed the "accountant of Auschwitz" <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/accused-nazi-officer-to-stand-trial-for-mass-killings.php">will stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he was an accessory to the killing of 300,000 people. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/germany-court-dismisses-case-against-former-nazi-solider.php">threw out a case</a> [JURIST report] against a former SS soldier who was accused of being involved in the largest massacre in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. In June US officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/us-officials-arrest-accused-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] 89-year-old Johann Breyer on charges that he was a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during World War II. In January 2014 a judge for Germany's Hagen State Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/germany-court-drops-case-against-92-year-old-former-nazi.php">dropped the case</a> [JURIST report] against 92-year-old Siert Bruins, a former member of the Nazi Waffen SS. Prosecutors had accused Bruins of executing captured Dutch Nazi-opposition fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 outside the town of Appingedam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US government on Friday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/29/rescission-cuba-state-sponsor-terrorism">formally removed</a> [press release] Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism as a positive step toward restoring Cuba-US diplomatic relations. US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] said in April that he would drop Cuba from the list. In December Obama and Cuban <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Raul+Castro">President Raul Castro</a> [JURIST news archive] stated they would take steps to restore diplomatic relations that were severed in 1961 by the US. Removal from this list ends a variety of sanctions from the US including opposing financial backing of the World Bank and International Monetary fund, US economic aid bans, and bans on US arms exports. Although not all sanctions have been removed from Cuba, the removal from the list may make private US companies and banks more likely to do business with Cuba. The two sides have held several rounds of negotiations since December and have stated they are close to a deal with to reopen US embassies. As of now, the only countries left on the list are Iran, Syria and Sudan. </p>

<p>The US and Cuba recently began working to restore ties for the first time since the nations <a href="http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113">severed relations</a> [CFR backgrounder] in 1961. In April a bill was introduced in the US House of Representatives proposing to tie any further removal of sanctions against Cuba to the nation's <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/house-bill-proposes-tying-human-rights-to-removal-of-sanctions-against-cuba.php">human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. In January eight Senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-end-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would end US travel restrictions on Cuba. The legislation, which was introduced by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, would also end financial transaction restrictions on travel between the two countries. In December Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/obama-announces-cuba-policy-changes.php">directed</a> [JURIST report] Secretary of State John Kerry to reestablish diplomatic relations and to review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. He also announced "steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba." In 2011 Obama ordered the Departments of State, Treasury and Homeland Security to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ease restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on travel and remittances to Cuba. The regulations built off of those <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009, which eased travel and remittances restrictions for Cuban Americans and their families in Cuba only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Croatia's parliament on Friday passed a law that grants compensation to victims of rape during the country's war of independence from Yugoslavia more than 20 years ago. Despite its lateness, the move has been hailed as an <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/29/croatia-passes-law-compensating-rape-victims-from-1990s-war">important step</a> [AP report] in recovering from the damage of the 1991-1995 conflict. The bill, which was passed with 86 votes in favor and three abstentions, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/us-croatia-rape-idUSKBN0OE1M620150529">entitles each victim</a> [Reuters report] to a one-time payment of 100,000 kuna (USD $14,504), a monthly allowance of 2,500 kuna, and access to free counseling, healthcare and legal aid. Matic War Veterans Minister Fred Matic last week told lawmakers that, "Such legislation is rare in the world, and it is the first of its kind in this region whereby the victims will get a dignified one-off financial compensation." The law will take effect next January. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia </a>(ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">backgrounder</a>] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced. In February Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/croatia-to-block-serbia-from-joining-eu-over-war-crimes-law.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Croatia would block Serbia from joining the EU unless it chaned a 2003 law allowing Belgrade to prosecute Croatians for war crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia. Earlier in February the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/118/18422.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] that Serbia and Croatia <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icj-rules-serbia-and-croatia-did-not-commit-genocide.php">did not commit genocide</a> [JURIST report] against one another's citizens during the 1990s wars that erupted after the division of Yugoslavia. In January the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/icty-upholds-bosnian-serb-genocide-convictions.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the genocide convictions of two Bosnian Serbs during the 1995 Srebenica massacre. In July a Dutch court found the government responsible for <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/netherlands-courts-finds-government-responsible-for-300-deaths-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">300 deaths</a> [JURIST report] in the Srebrenica massacre. The ICTY was created in 1993 by UN Resolution 827 to adjudicate the alleged war crimes perpetrated in the region of the former Yugoslavia since 1991.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights office: encryption crucial to free speech</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] on Thursday released a report arguing that strong encryption is elemental to basic human rights. The report <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/243381-un-report-encryption-necessary-to-exercise-human-rights">hails</a> [<em>The Hill</em> report] encryption and anonymity as tools that allow individuals to "exercise their rights to freedom of opinion and expression in a digital age," and thus deserve to be protected. The report strongly opposes intentionally compromising encryption, "even for arguably legitimate purposes." These "backdoors" weaken the online security of all users, something it calls on States to avoid. The report also urges the US Congress to consider passing the Secure Data Act. This bill would prevent the US government from requiring companies to include intentional compromises in their encryption, an action some federal officials defend as necessary in case data must be decrypted for criminal or national security investigations. </p>

<p>The report comes at a time when the US Congress is considering whether to extend or replace its data collection program, which is set to expire at the end of this month. Last week the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-senate-blocks-house-approved-bill-to-eliminate-phone-data-collection.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a House-approved bill that would end the mass collection of phone records by the National Security Agency (NSA) in an after midnight vote of 57-42. Several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/hilite/">ruled </a>[opinion, PDF] earlier this month that the Patriot Act <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">does not authorize</a> [JURIST report] the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges of the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?page=2,1">EU Rule of Law Mission</a> (EULEX) [official website] in Kosovo issued verdicts in the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?page=2,10,228">Drenica I</a> and <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?page=2,10,229">Drenica II</a> [press releases] cases on Wednesday and sentenced 11 Kosovo Albanian men to prison. The charges included the intentional perpetration of violence, cruel treatment, beating, torture, humiliating and degrading treatment of civilians and for some the killing of a Serbian police officer. All of the acts were committed between June and September of 1998 at a Kosovo Liberation Army detention center in Likovac. The sentenced men <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/27/us-kosovo-warcrimes-idUSKBN0OC1LQ20150527">include</a> [Reuters report] Kosovo's current ambassador to neighboring Albania, Sylejman Selimi, and two close allies to the former <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1474365/Hashim-Thaci">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [Britannica bio]. The prison sentences range from three to 12 years.</p>

<p>EULEX was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 to investigate crimes committed by ethnic Albanian rebels during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998 war with Serbia</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Various courts and organizations have been dedicated to prosecuting war crimes committed on both sides of the conflict, resulting in convictions of both <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-war-crimes-court-convicts-ex.php">Serbian</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-kosovo-authorities-sentence-former-rebel-fighter-on-war-crimes-charges.php">Kosovar</a> [JURIST reports] participants. Rebels during the conflict allegedly killed approximately 400 civilians. In April 2013 Serbia and Kosovo <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-welcomes-landmark-agreement-between-serbia-and-kosovo.php#.U1lMWa1dXG4">entered</a> [JURIST report] into a historic agreement on EU membership, signaling a reduction in hostility between the two nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, on Saturday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16025&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] several states to investigate allegations that members of their peacekeeping forces sent to the Central African Republic (CAR) have committed serious human rights violations. It is reported that soldiers have engaged in the killing of civilians, summary executions, abductions and sexual exploitation of local women and children. Zeid summarized the troubling contradiction by saying, "[t]he role of international forces in halting the worst of the fighting and sectarian slaughter in CAR has been invaluable, and their presence has unquestionably saved many, many lives. Yet, in some cases the longed-for protectors turned into predators." The High Commissioner's statement revealed that many states' forces are under suspicion of engaging in the "disturbing" behavior and some have issued sanctions to the soldiers involved. In addition to requesting further investigation, the High Commissioner also announced he is sending a team to look into possible further measures to address human rights violations in the CAR.</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR for the past two years, escalating after the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted the government of Bozize in March 2013. According to UN estimates, nearly 440,000 people remain displaced in the country while 190,000 others have sought asylum outside its borders. In April the CAR government <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/central-african-republic-government-establishes-special-criminal-court.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to create a Special Criminal Court to investigate the atrocities committed during recent unrest in the country. In September the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-prosecutor-opens-second-investigation-into-central-african-republic-war-crimes.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] a second investigation into CAR war crimes. Members of the international community maintain that there is much <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2015/05/29/13-35401opinion.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] portions of two Idaho abortion laws. The <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title18/T18CH5SECT18-505.htm"> Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [text] prohibited abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The court struck it down as "unconstitutional because it categorically bans some abortions before viability." The court also found that the <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title18/T18CH6SECT18-608.htm">Abortion and Contraceptives Act</a> [text], requiring women seeking abortions in the second trimester to do so in a hospital setting, placed an undue burden on these women. Jennie McCormack and Dr. Richard Hearn challenged the laws after McCormack was arrested and released for her abortion through the RU-486 pill in 2011. The court's ruling reaffirmed that women have the right to "choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State."</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.tn.gov/governor/">Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/tennessee-adopts-48-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into a law a bill requiring a 48-hour waiting period for women seeking an abortion, and <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official website] signed House Bill 1409 into law <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/oklahoma-governor-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period.php">extending the mandatory</a> [JURIST report] waiting period for women seeking an abortion from 24 to 72 hours. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Also in April <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Kansas Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey<a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php"> signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women that they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion, in addition to barring women from buying any healthcare plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions. Also in March the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-on-abortion-bill.php">West Virginia Legislature overrode</a> [JURIST report] the state governor's veto, passing a bill that bans abortion after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egyptian authorities on Saturday freed Egyptian-American prisoner Mohammed Soltan, who had been sentenced to life in prison and had been on a hunger strike for over a year. As a precondition to Soltan's release, he had to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/30/egypt-frees-us-egyptian-national-sentenced-to-life-in-prison">renounce his Egyptian citizenship</a> [AP report]. Soltan was convicted on charges of financing an anti-government sit-in and spreading "false news." Soltan is a former Obama campaigner and Ohio State University graduate. Authorities came to the family's home looking for Soltan's father and arrested him instead. His father was later found and detained. Soltan had been working as a translator for US and international news during the protests surrounding the 2013 ouster of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">ex-president Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile]. He had been on a 16-month hunger strike before he was freed, and his family stated his health was deteriorating fast. </p>

<p>Egyptian courts continue to prosecute supporters of former president Morsi. Earlier this month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-30-islamists-to-life-imprisonment.php">sentenced</a> 30 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to life imprisonment on charges of violent behavior, and another court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] Morsi and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. Many of Morsi's supporters belong to the Muslim Brotherhood and have become targets of current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile]. Also this month Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-executes-6-men-convicted-of-murdering-soldiers.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] six men convicted of killing two Egyptian soldiers. And earlier in May Morsi supporters were <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/morsi-supporters-sentenced-to-life-for-illegal-protesting-acts-of-violence.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to life in prison for illegal protests and acts of violence which were destructive to the Al-Marg district of Cairo, but were said to be in protest of death sentences handed down for members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Members of the Brotherhood were also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-sentences-4-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] earlier this year on charges of murder and possession of firearms stemming from clashes that took place days before Morsi's ouster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C587F3E1D389477185257E54004EC05A/$file/14-5299-1554796.pdf">decided</a> [opinion, PDF] not to get involved, for the time being, in a case regarding whether the public should have access to video footage showing a <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee being force-fed. The court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to issue orders regarding the videotapes. "We cannot reach the merits of this appeal ... because it is premature," the court stated in its opinion. The videotapes are of Abu Wa'el Dhiab, who was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and subsequently sent to Guantanamo Bay. Dhiab was cleared for release by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2010/06/02/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf">Guantanamo Review Task Force</a> [report, PDF] in 2009, but he remained at the prison until last year. In 2013, while still awaiting his release, he participated in a hunger strike with other inmates, which prompted guards to begin force-feeding them. Dhiab, who currently lives in Uruguay, originally filed his lawsuit to stop the force-feedings, but now has shifted the focus to making the videotapes available to the public.</p>

<p>Dhiab's ordeal regarding force-feeding at Guantanamo Bay has been ongoing for over a year now. In October the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/doj-seeks-stay-on-release-of-guantanamo-force-feeding-videos.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to stay an order issued by the court earlier that month requiring the public release of the Dhiab videos. In May 2014 the same court <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/federal-judge-orders-to-halt-force-feeding-at-guantanamo-bay.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] officials in Guantanamo Bay to temporarily suspend forced feedings of Dhiab. However, a week later Judge Gladys Kessler <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/us-judge-allows-force-feeding-of-guantanamo-prisoner-to-continue.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] allowing the military to resume force feeding Dhiab, stating that "the court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary" to keep the prisoner alive. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt's <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/index.php/en/">National Council for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported on Sunday that at least 2,600 people have been killed by violence in the 18 months following the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution">military ouster</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] in 2013. Head of the agency Mohammed Fayeq told reporters that the 2,600 casualties included 700 policemen and 550 civilians killed between June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2014. The military overthrew Morsi on July 3, 2013, during massive protests calling for his immediate removal. Islamists supporting Morsi continued to protest in the following months. The protests <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/world/middleeast/egypt.html">came to a breaking point</a> [NYT report] when, on August 14, 2013, police attacked two large Islamist protest groups, killing more than 600 people. Protesters retaliated by attacking police stations and churches. Since the incident, Egypt has taken a harsh stance on punishing Morsi's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder], arresting thousands of supporters and sentencing many to death.</p>

<p>Egypt's tumultuous situation with the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi supporters continues today. Earlier this month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-30-islamists-to-life-imprisonment.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 30 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to life imprisonment on charges of violent behavior. Also this month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced Morsi</a> [JURIST report] and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. The prison break occurred during the country's 2011 uprising that ousted then-president Hosni Mubarak. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-morsi-trial-badly-flawed.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the trial of Morsi was "badly flawed" and compromised by due process violations. In Feburary an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">confirmed death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 183 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi. The men were convicted in December 2014 of playing a role in an attack on a police station in the governate of Giza, known as the "Kerdasa massacre," which resulted in the death of 11 police officers and two civilians.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-983_7l48.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/elonis-v-united-states/">Elonis v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that negligence is not enough to support a conviction for communicating a threat. In this case the court was asked to consider whether a conviction of threatening another person over interstate lines under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875">18 USC § 875(c)</a> [text] requires proof that the defendant maintained subjective intent to threaten, or if it is enough to prove that a reasonable person would feel threatened by the statement(s). Anthony Elonis posted threatening statements on his Facebook page and was convicted by a federal jury. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4308060285736836867&amp;q=elonis+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">upheld his conviction</a> [opinion] under the "reasonable person" standard. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the Third Circuit's instruction, requiring only negligence with respect to the communication of a threat, is not sufficient to support a conviction under Section 875(c). Justice Samuel Alito filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion. They objected that the court did not issue a clear ruling on what standard is required.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-threatening-social-media-posts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in December. Elonis argued that under the First Amendment the government had to prove that he had a subjective intent to threaten, and he claimed that he was only posting rap lyrics. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-threats-administrative-rule-interpretations.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case last June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-1 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-abercrombie-fitch-stores-inc/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] in favor of a Muslim woman who was denied a job at <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> [corporate website]. The question before the court was whether an employer can be liable under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> [text] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for declining to hire an applicant based on the applicant's religion only if the employer's knowledge that the applicant required religious accommodation resulted from direct, explicit notice by the applicant. In this case, Samantha Elauf interviewed for a job with Abercrombie & Fitch while wearing a headscarf (hijab), pursuant to her Muslim faith. Elauf was not hired, purportedly due to her black headscarf, which violated Abercrombie's "look" policy. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court held that Title VII, which prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant in order to avoid accommodating a religious practice that it could accommodate without undue hardship, applies even where an applicant has not directly informed the employer of his need for an accommodation. "Instead, an applicant need only show that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer&#8217;s decision." Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-religious-accommodation-attorney-compensation.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in February. <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php"><em>Certiorari</em> was granted</a> [JURIST report] in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1421_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-of-america-n-a-v-caulkett/">Bank of America, N.A. v. Caulkett</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding may not void a junior mortgage lien under §506(d) when the debt owed on a senior mortgage lien exceeds the current value of the collateral if the creditor's claim is both secured by a lien and allowed under §502 of the Bankruptcy Code. The case involved Florida homeowners who took out a second mortgage with Bank of America. When respondents filed for bankruptcy under 11 USC § 506(d), the laws allowed the homeowners to "strip off" a junior mortgage lien in its entirety, i.e. the second mortgage with BOA, because the outstanding debt owed to a senior lienholder exceeded the current value of the collateral. Monday's ruling resolves a circuit spit on the issue.</p>

<p>The case was consolidated with <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-of-america-n-a-v-toledo-cardona/">Bank of America, NA v. Toledo-Cardona</a> [SCOTUSblog materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1034_3dq4.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mellouli-v-holder/">Mellouli v. Lynch</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that an immigrant's conviction for concealing unnamed pills in his sock did not trigger removal under under the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text]. The INA provides that non-citizens may be deported if they are convicted of violating "any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21)[.]" The case before the court specifically challenges the ability of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website] to remove permanent residents for violations of state drug law. Moones Mellouli, a citizen of Tunisia and permanent resident of the US, was convicted for possession of drug paraphernalia under Kansas law. However, his conviction records did not specifically identify the substance with which he was found. Mellouli argued that because there is a possibility that his Kansas drug-paraphernalia conviction did not involve a federally controlled substance, the government should be required to prove a connection between his drug-paraphernalia conviction and a substance on the federal schedule. The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that Mellouli's conviction for drug paraphernalia was sufficiently general to fall under the category of drug trade, and was thus <a href="https://casetext.com/case/mellouli-v-holder">covered under the INA</a> [opinion]. In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed.</p>

<p>Just Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-adds-5-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case last June and <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-immigration-and-nationality-act-bankruptcy-court-jurisdiction.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sohel Rana and 40 other people were charged with murder on Monday over the 2013 <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-bangladesh-building-collapse-20130508-story.html">collapse</a> [LAT report] of a garment factory that killed more than 1,100 people. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/web/index.php">Bangladesh authorities</a> [official website] brought charges against <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22366454">Rana</a> [BBC profile], the building owner, as well as his parents and more than a dozen government officials for ignoring warnings that should have caused those involved to shut down the building. Rana and the other building owners forced workers into the building instead, despite protest due to significant cracks in the exterior that had developed the day before. The building, Rana Plaza, was originally built only five stories tall, intended as a shopping mall, but three additional stories were illegally added later to increase productivity. Initially charged with culpable homicide, the accused are now facing murder charges due to the seriousness of the accident. If convicted, they could face capital punishment. A court hearing is scheduled for late next month to decide how to proceed.</p>

<p>The accident <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html?pagewanted=all">drew attention</a> [NYT report] to the plight of the poor in Bangladesh. In response, Bangladesh lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-lawmakers-approve-changes-to-labor-law.php">approved new labor laws</a> [JURIST report] in July 2013, which permitted unions greater power in the nation but created barriers to entry that some argue are impractically high. The changes came in an effort to update the Bangladeshi laws to meet international standards. Bangladesh has ratified most of the core <a href="http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/promoting-international-labor-standards/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> [official website] labor standards, including Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and Convention No. 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. According to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html">World Factbook</a>, exports totaled $28.62 billion in 2013 and an estimated $31.2 billion in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four former Serbian secret service agents pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Monday relating to the 1999 slaying of journalist <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2014&mm=04&dd=11&nav_id=89960">Slavko Curuvija</a> [b92 report]. Curuvija, an outspoken critic of former Serbian leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/8538575/Serbian-war-criminals-Slobodan-Milosevic-profile.html">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile], was shot and killed outside his apartment in an assassination planned by former Serbian spy agency chief Radomir Markovic. Milosevic's wife, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/08/warcrimes.balkans">Mirjana Markovic</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], accused Curuvija of being a supporter of NATO in their <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html">war against Serbia</a> [PBS backgrounder] days before he was killed. Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for war crimes, and his former wife has been granted political asylum in Russia. </p>

<p>The long-delayed trial in the death of Slavko Curuvija demonstrates that Serbia is attempting, in some respects, to remedy past human rights issues. Despite these efforts, the UN and other groups have often appealed to the Serbian government in an attempt to improve their adherence to human rights tenets. In 2011 Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-serbia-to-halt-roma-evictions.php">entreated</a> [JURIST report] the Serbian government to stop the forced eviction of Roma, and to provide them with adequate housing and compensation. In 2012 the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-un-high-commissioner-for-1.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Serbia to protect universal freedoms by lifting a ban on a pride parade for the LGBT community. This past April Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-asylum-seekers-suffering-abuse-at-hands-of-serbia-police.php">criticizing</a> [JURIST report] the alleged extortion and physical abuse inflicted by Serbian authorities on asylum-seekers and migrants escaping war-torn countries. Last month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-expert-calls-on-serbia-to-ameliorate-housing-crisis.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Serbian government to take immediate action to improve the current housing crisis that has left many Serbian citizens without adequate housing. While Serbia boasts a high rate of homeownership due to the privatization and sale of public housing stock in the 1990s, homeowners and renters reportedly suffer from inadequate living arrangements. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org.ua/en/information-centre/news/1870">UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine</a> [official website] released its tenth <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/10thOHCHRreportUkraine.pdf">report</a> [press release, PDF] on Monday, documenting the serious human rights abuses that persist in eastern Ukraine. The violations include "shelling, executions, arbitrary and illegal detentions, torture, ill-treatment, human trafficking and the lack of justice and accountability, as well as deprivation of economic and social rights." While the report acknowledges that the previously alarming levels of indiscriminate shelling have decreased due to the February <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/assets/Uploads/Package-of-Measures-for-the-Implementation-of-the-Minsk-Agreements.pdf">Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements</a> [materials, PDF], some areas of high conflict continue to face intensive use of heavy weapons and landmines, resulting in high civilian casualties. The report offers estimated figures compiled by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) and the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official websites] that conservatively document fatalities at 6,417 and injuries at 15,962. Even with a decrease in hostilities, human rights abuses continue to be perpetrated by armed groups, who have been accused of "killings, torture and ill-treatment, illegal deprivation of liberty, forced labour, looting, ransom demands and extortion of money." The report emphasizes that Ukrainian civilians living in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea live their lives with tremendous hardship, in constant fear of violence. The report urges all parties involved to attempt to resolve their differences, and to fully implement the 12 February Package of Measures in an effort to cease the violence. </p>

<p>Ukraine has been internationally criticized for their continuing human rights abuses as a result of the current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">crisis</a> [BBC timeline]. In March <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-ukraine-government-rebels-using-cluster-munitions.php">chastised</a> [JURIST report] Ukraine for using cluster munitions, which violate the laws of war because of the high casualties that result when used in populated areas. In April <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-ukraine-rebels-killed-captured-soldiers.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine of killing captured government soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law. Later that month the OHCHR expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-office-concerned-by-intensified-fighting-in-ukraine.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] for the "dire rights situation" in Ukraine after reports of fighting in violation of the<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31436513"> Minsk Agreement</a> [BBC backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Key provisions of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">USA Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF ] expired Monday after a late Senate Vote failed to establish an extension. The provisions that expired were in Section 215 of the act and included: the "Bulk Data Collection" provision, which allowed the government to collect data, the "Lone Wolf" provision, which allowed surveillance on individuals not directly tied to terrorist groups, and the "Roving Wiretaps" provision, which allowed the government to surveil all of a suspected terrorist's communications. The Senate gathered to vote on the bill late Sunday, but fierce debate pushed the vote into the early hours of Monday morning. Although the Senate failed to establish an extension for the Patriot Act, they are set to vote on the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3361">USA Freedom Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-house-approves-bill-to-eliminate-phone-data-collection.php">report</a>] which is supposed to serve as a limit on government surveillance.</p>

<p>Several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. The focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">result of revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. Several human rights groups have taken legal action challenging the NSA. In March rights groups filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. The plaintiffs include the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Wikimedia. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/b0029ec8-3dab-4f0f-95d9-175044645632/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] earlier this month that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">Patriot Act does not authorize</a> [JURIST report] the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Korea and China on Monday signed a bilateral free trade agreement that will eliminate most tariffs between the two countries over the next two decades. After approximately three years of negotiations, Chinese Commerce Minister <a href="http://gaohucheng2.mofcom.gov.cn/">Gao Hucheng</a> and South Korean Trade Minister <a href="http://www.korea.net/Government/Administration/Cabinet">Yoon Sang-jick</a> [official profiles] <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/its-official-china-south-korea-sign-free-trade-agreement/">signed the agreement</a> [The Diplomat report] in Seoul, South Korea, which will remove tariffs on approximately 90 percent of goods traded between the two nations over the next 20 years. The agreement must now be voted on and passed by the legislatures of both countries before it can go into effect, though it is expected to be approved this year. The agreement does <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-korea-china-sign-free-trade-deal-31436293">not include the trade of rice</a> [AP report].</p>

<p>This agreement signifies just one of several steps that the leaders of South Korea and China have taken in order to strengthen their bond. While South Korea and China have experienced the most growth in their economic ties they have farther to go to establish a stronger military bond. Last month top leaders from the two nations met to bridge this gap, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/china-and-south-koreas-lagging-military-ties/">advocating</a> [The Diplomat report] "for more military exchanges and defense cooperation between Beijing and Seoul." Also last month South Korea and China, along with Japan, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31997576">met</a> [BBC report] to "ease tensions over territorial and diplomatic disputes." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Hungarian appeals court on Monday ordered the retrial of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bela+Biszku">Bela Biszku</a> [JURIST news archive], a high-ranking leader of the Hungarian Communist Party, who was convicted for war crimes following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/23/newsid_3140000/3140400.stm">1956 uprising</a> [BBC report]. The intermediate court found that the verdict rendered at trial was "unfounded" and "not suitable for revision" due to errors in the lower court's logic in reaching its conclusions, and the over-reliance of prosecutors on opinions given as testimony by a sole historian. While Biszku has been long identified by historians as a driving force behind the repression following the 1956 uprising, the appeals court was reluctant to apply criminal responsibility where there was only evidence of historical responsibility. The appellate court vacated the lower court's ruling and ordered a retrial be conducted in a manner as to address the flaws they identified. </p>

<p>Hungary has recently advocated and implemented increasingly restrictive legislation and practices. In February Hungary's increased surveillance and legal actions against local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-international-urges-hungary-to-end-crackdown-against-ngos.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] as a hard-line stance against foreign funded corporations. A week later Hungary's ruling party <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hungary-ruling-party-stricter-immigration-policy-needed.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that the country must pass legislation to tighten the border and prevent migrants from abusing the EU's political asylum laws. Later that month <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php">condemned</a> [advocacy website, JURIST report]  the EU for refusing to take action to address Hungary's alleged problematic laws and practices regarding human rights since the European Commission enacted a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/effective-justice/files/com_2014_158_annexes_en.pdf">"rule of law" measure</a> [text, PDF] in March 2014</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia, Bahame Tom Mukirya Nyanduga, on Monday urged the government of Somalia to continue working to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16028&LangID=E">increase human rights protections</a> [press release]. Bahame Nyanduga stressed the importance of protecting freedom of expression, noting that, "Somali journalists are often harassed, arrested, censored, even imprisoned, and media organisations are closed down." He said:<blockquote>Such incidents risk having a chilling effect on this basic right, particularly essential at a time when Somalia moves towards finalising its State-building process. ... I call on the Government to put in place a legal framework that guarantees the freedom of the media, to practise their profession free of intimidation, harassment and imprisonment.</blockquote>Bahame Nyanduga also called on the government to follow through with its promise to implement a moratorium on the death penalty and to strengthen the country's justice system.</p>

<p>The country of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Somalia">Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive] has been in turmoil for years due to issues of poverty, hunger and war. In April Human Rights Watch reported that Somali government officials had <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-somalia-government-evicted-thousands-of-displaced-people.php">evicted</a> [JURIST report] thousands of displaced people from Mogadishu in early March. In February Somalia's prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/somalia-prime-minister-urges-us-banks-to-resume-money-transfers.php">appealed to the US government and US banks</a> [JURIST report] to resume allowing money transfers to Somalia, a crucial service for many in the war-torn country. In April 2014 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-urges-death-penalty-moratorium-in-Somalia.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Somali authorities to place a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session29/Documents/A_HRC_29_23_en.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released Tuesday. The commission found that while LGBT rights have increased since the UN's first study found widespread discrimination and violence towards these individuals, the current state of LGBT rights still involves pervasive and violent abuse, harassment and discrimination. Specifically, the report states that, "there is as yet no dedicated human rights mechanism at the international level that has a systematic and comprehensive approach to the human rights situation of LGBT and interest persons." It indicates that terrorist groups may target LGBT individuals and that the data available suggest high rates of homicide involving these individuals. The report, to be presented to the UN Human Rights Council later this month, calls on national governments in all regions to remedy this discrimination by, among other recommendations, legally recognizing same-sex relationships, repealing laws that punish individuals for their sexual orientation or gender identity, enacting hate-crime laws that will apply to those who discriminate against LGBT individuals, and ending abusive therapies and treatments of LGBT individuals. </p>

<p>LGBT individuals have struggled both domestically and internationally against <a href="/hotline/2014/09/graeme-reid-lgbt-rights.php">discriminatory laws</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In October the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-human-rights-office-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-reject-discriminatory-lgbt-bill.php">urged Kyrgyzstan to reject a bill</a> [JURIST report] that could have allowed for LGBT discrimination. Also that month Human Rights Watch released a report in which it urged Jamaica to <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-condemns-lgbt-discrimination-in-jamaica.php">repeal laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations</a> [JURIST report] between adults, and to remove the gender-specific definitions for sexual intercourse and rape. In early 2014 human rights groups in Iran urged the president to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/human-rights-activists-increase-pressure-on-iran-president-to-end-persecution-of-gays.php">end the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of gay individuals. In September 2013 the UN released a video <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-sg-urges-nations-to-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-people.php">calling for the end to LGBT discrimination</a> [JURIST report] in all countries. The UN has increasingly paid attention to this issue, as 2013 was the first year the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/first-un-ministerial-meeting-on-gay-rights-held.php">held a ministerial meeting on LGBT rights</a> [JURIST report]. Recently the US has focused its attention primarily on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same+sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. However, last July US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/obama-signs-order-on-lgbt-job-discrimination.php">signed an anti-discrimination executive order</a> [JURIST report] aimed at ending LGBT employment discrimination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canada's <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TRC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf">urged</a> [report, PDF] the government to move from "apology to action" in its policies and programs directed toward restoring the aboriginal peoples' relationships with the rest of the country. The TRC interviewed more than 7,000 individuals to track a six-year timeline of abuse and neglect of the aboriginal peoples, with special emphasis on the disparity of educational opportunities to aboriginal peoples. Its report characterizes Canada's 100-year history with these individuals as a "cultural genocide," and <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf">recommends</a> [calls to action, PDF] 94 remedial actions to be taken by all levels of Canadian government, corporate entities, educators and others named in the report. The TRC specifically requests, among other things, that the government acknowledge its fault in the current state of aboriginal health; that the federal government implement laws to increase aboriginal peoples' health care rights; that the government create new funding for aboriginal education legislation; that the federal government provide the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation with $10 million over a seven-year period; and that a national council for reconciliation be created for purposes of reporting progress in reconciliation.</p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In September the UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-rights-expert-indigenous-peoples-voices-must-be-heard.php">raised awareness for indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report], comprising approximately 370 million people in 90 countries around the world, and urged members of the international community to reconcile any past differences with indigenous peoples for prior rights violations and work towards open communication about the important legal issues which affect indigenous populations. In October 2013 a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-concerned-for-indigenous-people-in-canada.php">expressed similar concern for aboriginal people</a> [JURIST report] in Canada, finding that despite the general wealth of Canada's citizens as a whole, one in five indigenous people live in poverty, and concluding that the country faced a "crisis" at that time. In August 2013 then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-urges-countries-to-respect-treaties-with-indigenous-peoples.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] states to honor treaties with indigenous peoples, regardless of how long ago they were signed, as such treaties serve to protect human rights. In December 2010 US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US would support the <a href="http://undesadspd.org/IndigenousPeoples.aspx">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People</a> [text]. The declaration adopted in 2007, is a non-binding treaty outlining the global human rights of approximately 370 million indigenous people and banning discrimination against them. The US was one of four member states originally opposed to adopting the treaty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Authorities in Egypt on Tuesday announced the arrest of two leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo's Gaza district after they were both convicted and sentenced to death <em>in absentia</em>. Mahmoud Ghozlan and Abdul Rahman al-Barr were part of the brotherhood's highest office, the Guidance Bureau, and the organization <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=32160">condemned the arrests</a> [press release]. Authorities <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/02/us-egypt-brotherhood-arrest-idUSKBN0OI0QB20150602">announced</a> [Reuters report] on Tuesday that they had broken up a cell of the group that was collecting government intelligence for foreign countries. Because their convictions were handed down <em>in absentia</em>, Egyptian law requires that they be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-arrests-top-muslim-brotherhood-leaders/2015/06/02/f7466a52-08fc-11e5-951e-8e15090d64ae_story.html">retried when arrested</a> [AP report]. The arrests were made one day before former president and Muslim Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi was expected to be sentenced by the court, but a judge has stated he will announce the ruling on June 16.</p>

<p>Egypt's tumultuous situation with the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi supporters continues today. Egypt's <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/index.php/en/">National Council for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported on Sunday that at least <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-rights-agency-2600-killed-in-18-months-following-morsis-ouster.php">2,600 people</a> [JURIST report] were killed by violence in the 18 months following Morsi's military ouster. An Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-30-islamists-to-life-imprisonment.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 30 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to life imprisonment in May on charges of violent behavior. Also in May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced Morsi</a> [JURIST report] and more than 100 others to death for their involvement in a mass prison break. The prison break occurred during the country's 2011 uprising which ousted then-president Hosni Mubarak. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-morsi-trial-badly-flawed.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the Morsi's trial was "badly flawed" and compromised by due process violations. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] death sentences for 183 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi. The men were convicted in December 2014 of playing a role in an attack on a police station in the governate of Giza, known as the "Kerdasa massacre," which resulted in the death of 11 police officers and two civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee has alleged that the CIA's torture techniques went beyond those described in last year's Senate Intelligence Committee report, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-detainee-alleges-cia-sexual-abuse-torture-beyond-151253658.html">Reuters reported</a> [text] Tuesday. Majid Khan was detained in Pakistan in 2003 and confessed to delivering money to al Qaeda used for a bombing in Jakarta that killed 11 people. He also admitted to planning with other al Qaeda members to poison water supplies and blow up gas stations. Khan's lawyer released interview notes claiming that the CIA interrogators poured ice water on his private areas; video taped him naked while touching his genitals; beat him with sticks, belts, baseball bats, and a hammer; forced him to endure rectal feedings; and kept him in <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-ci-majid-khan-torture-20150602-story.html">solitary confinement</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] for two years. Khan was arraigned last year, and is set to be sentenced next year, facing up to 19 years in prison. </p>

<p>The CIA has been continually accused of torturing terrorist suspects since the attacks on September 11, 2001.<br />
In December the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights</a> [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-expert-urges-prosecution-of-us-officials-responsible-for-torture.php">prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of CIA and other government officials for the interrogation and torture of detainees. That same month the so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed during the Bush administration were deemed to be <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">ineffective</a> [JURIST report], according to the long-awaited Senate Intelligence Committee Report. Last September it was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/cia-used-extreme-torture-methods-on-terrorist-suspects-report.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the CIA used torture methods beyond waterboarding on suspected terrorists, according to a report published by the <em>Telegraph</em>. In late August 10 victims of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">CIA's extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive] signed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/cia-rendition-victims-urge-obama-to-name-them-in-senate-report.php">open letter</a> [JURIST report] to US President Barack Obama urging him to declassify the upcoming Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] approved the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048">USA Freedom Act</a> [HR 2048 materials] on Tuesday, which reduces the federal government's surveillance of Americans' phone records. Shortly after the approval, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [backgrounder] <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/02/statement-press-secretary-hr-2048">signed the measure</a> into law, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/02/statement-president-usa-freedom-act">stating</a> [press releases]:<blockquote>[M]y Administration will work expeditiously to ensure our national security professionals again have the full set of vital tools they need to continue protecting the country. Just as important, enactment of this legislation will strengthen civil liberty safeguards and provide greater public confidence in these programs, including by prohibiting bulk collection through the use of Section 215, [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] pen registers, and National Security Letters and by providing the American people with additional transparency measures.</blockquote>The legislation is a significant departure from national security measures implemented 14 years ago just after the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The passage of the bill will allow the government to restart and modify surveillance operations, only with new restrictions. The legislation will require the government to obtain a warrant to collect phone metadata from telecommunications companies in addition to making the <a href="http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> [official website], which reviews the warrant requests, more transparent. </p>

<p>The bill's passage was driven largely by efforts to reform the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] that came after former NSA contractor <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=edward+snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST archive] leaked information about the bulk collection of phone records in 2013. In May the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-court-remands-aclu-case-against-nsa-surveillance.php">Patriot Act does not authorize</a> [JURIST report] the NSA to collect millions of Americans' phone records. In March <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/rights-groups-challenge-nsa-mass-surveillance-program.php">rights groups filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court against the NSA, alleging that one of the NSA's mass surveillance programs violates privacy rights and threatens free communication. In 2013 US lawmakers were <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">pushing for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity despite reports revealing phone and internet monitoring. Several human rights groups have taken legal action in challenging the NSA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the Quebec Superior Court has <a href="http://tjl.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-05-27-AA-Jmt.pdf">awarded over $15 billion</a> [judgment, PDF] (USD $12 billion) in damages to Quebec smokers in a case against tobacco companies JTI-Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, making this the largest award for damages and the biggest class action lawsuit in Canada's history. In a ruling made public Monday, Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan said that by refusing to inform health authorities or the public of what they knew, the companies chose profits over the health of their customers. The judgment requires that the companies issue initial compensation of over $1 billion in the next 60 days, no matter if they elect to appeal. How the funds will be distributed will be decided by the judge at a later date. The plaintiffs are Quebec smokers who said the firms failed to warn them of health risks associated with smoking. The lawsuits were filed in 1998 but only recently went to trial. The plaintiffs' main point of contention was that the companies did not properly warn their customers and failed in their duty "not to cause injury to another person." The tobacco companies plan to appeal the ruling, arguing that the customers have been well aware of the risks of smoking since the 1950s and thus should not be entitled to any damages.</p>

<p>In May of last year the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-suits-against-tobacco-companies.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a consolidated lawsuit brought against various tobacco companies. In August 2014 the World Health Organization <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/world-health-organization-calls-for-strong-regulation-of-electronic-cigarettes.php">called for strict regulation</a> [JURIST report] of electronic cigarettes, including a ban on the usage of the devices in public places and advertising targeting minors. In June 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/thailand-court-approves-graphic-warnings-on-cigarette-packages.php">approved a new regulation</a> [JURIST report] requiring packs of cigarettes in the country to be 85 percent covered with graphic health warnings. In February 2014 the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">EU Parliament</a> [official website] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/eu-parliament-votes-to-approve-smoking-regulations.php">approve an anti-tobacco law</a> [JURIST report] that requires cigarette makers to increase the size of health warnings on packets from 30 percent to 65 percent of the surface of the package.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Around 8,000 Nigerian civilians have been killed since 2011 as a result of abuses by military forces, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/nigeria-military-report/">reported</a> [materials] Wednesday. The report attributes civilian deaths to torture, starvation, suffocation and executions by military forces at detention camps. AI's Secretary General Salil Shetty said, "[t]he previous Nigerian administration's utterly callous 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' attitude when it comes to the hundreds of stories of death coming out of the military detention centers beggars belief." AI says the military's actions at the detention camps are part of a "witch hunt" in an effort to locate and fight members of Boko Haram, who threaten the security of the nation. AI is calling for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate into any possible crimes against humanity committed at the camps and to bring justice to the victims of violent crimes.  </p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boko+haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. Two weeks ago the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, reported that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">murdering women and girls</a> [JURIST report] previously taken captive by the group. At the end of March Nigeria held its presidential and gubernatorial elections in spite of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/nigeria-holds-presidential-elections-amid-violence.php">violent attacks directed towards voters</a> [JURIST report] by Boko Haram. The elections, originally scheduled for February 14, were <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/nigeria-elections-postponed-following-boko-haram-v/?page=all">postponed</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] as Nigeria attempted to eradicate Boko Haram after reports that the group had acquired military-grade weaponry, including armored personnel carriers. In February the UN reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">girls have been attacked</a> [JURIST report] and been subjected to gender oppression in at least 70 countries for seeking an education. In January the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-security-council-condemns-boko-haram-attacks.php">UN Security Council condemned attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to terrorist attacks and the release of abducted child soldiers. The hostilities included mass killings, destruction of civilian homes and suicide bombings where children where induced to carry out the attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of California on Wednesday agreed to a <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/legal-settlement-california-lethal-injection-method/">settlement</a> [text] that may lead to the state reinstating the use of its death chamber. Under the terms of the settlement the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) [official website] will provide new regulatory standards for lethal injections after the US Supreme Court rules in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on lethal injection protocols. California currently has <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_28236441/california-death-penalty-state-agrees-propose-execution-method">750 inmates</a> [<em>San Jose Mercury News</em> report] on death row but has not executed anyone in nearly a decade. If the Supreme Court's ruling, expected by the end of this month, impedes on CDCR's abilities then the settlement states that the parties will re-confer. </p>

<p>Use of the <a href="/feature/featured/death-penalty-and-intellectual-disabilities/">death penalty</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue throughout the US and internationally. Last month Nebraska became the nineteenth US state to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/nebraska-lawmakers-override-veto-to-abolish-death-penalty.php">ban capital punishment</a> [JURIST report]. In April the US Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-oklahoma-lethal-injection-procedure.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure. Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-dies-after-botched-adminstering-of-lethal-injection.php">became the face</a> [JURIST report] of the legal injection drug debate last year after death row inmate Clayton Lockett died of an apparent heart attack shortly after doctors called off a failed attempt to execute him using a lethal injection drug called midazolam. Also in April the Delaware Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/delaware-senate-votes-to-repeal-death-penalty.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-reinstating-firing-squad-option-for-executions.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to restore the firing squad as a method of execution, making Utah one of the few states with that option. Like in Oklahoma, if drugs used for lethal injections are unavailable, a firing squad would be allowed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a> [official website] on Wednesday issued "wanted person alerts" for six men having ties to the ongoing <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-scandal-timeline-20150603-story.html">FIFA scandal</a> [LAT backgrounder] on charges including racketeering, money laundering and corruption. The alerts are a notice and warning that the men may be arrested in any country to which they travel. The six men include two senior officials and four corporate executives. Two of the six, former vice president Jack Warner from Trinidad and former executive Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay, have already been arrested in their respective home countries. The other four men, Alejandro Burzaco from Argentina, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis from Argentina and Jose Marguiles from Brazil, are still at large. Burzaco and the two Jinkis men have allegedly paid more than USD $100 million in bribes for media rights to soccer matches. The alerts come only a day after the unexpected <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-to-resign-as-fifa-president.html">announcement</a> [NYT report] by Sepp Blatter that he would resign as president of FIFA.</p>

<p>The FIFA corruption scandal broke last month when US prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/top-fifa-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 14 top FIFA officials with offenses including racketeering, money laundering and bribery, alleging that the men used partnerships with sports marketing executives to solicit more than $150 million in bribes and kickbacks to support various sites of FIFA World Cup events. The prosecutors claimed that at least some of the defendants, nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives, have participated in the scheme to enrich themselves for over two decades. FIFA has long been accused of corruption, but this is the largest case ever assembled against the organization in regards to those types of allegations. FBI Director James Comey <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/05/27/fifa-officials-arrested-corruption-charges-extradition-united-states/27997783/">stated</a> [USA Today Report], "Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA." An <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/fifa-scandal-explained/">issue</a> [Wired report] with the organization is that in its voting for a president and executive committee, each of the 209 member nations gets a single vote. Also, each country receives an equal share of FIFA's revenues. Therefore, there is less incentive for the smaller, poorer countries to attempt to change any of the structure to the voting process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Muslim rights organization called Wednesday for a thorough investigation into the fatal shooting of a Muslim man in Boston. The <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] made the request a day after 26-year-old Usaama Rahim was killed by police after having been under surveillance by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/terrorism/terrorism_jttfs">Joint Terrorism Task Force</a> [official website]. CAIR Director Jennifer Wicks also requested that authorities release video footage of the shooting, which shows the incident between Rahim and local police. Boston Police Commissioner <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/topic/william_evans">William Evans</a> [<em>Boston Herald</em> news archive] <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/us_politics/2015/06/the_latest_on_surveillance_shooting_knife_attack_thwarted">stated</a> [<em>Boston Herald</em> report] that "military and law enforcement lives were at threat" and that the video shows the police officers "backtracking" as Rahim approached them.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on Tuesday in front of a CVS in Boston, where Rahim had worked since March. Rahim allegedly lunged at the members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force as they approached him to ask questions. One official stated that Rahim was making threats against law enforcement. The chairman of the <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/">House Committee on Homeland Security</a> [official website] Rep. <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/about/chair">Michael McCaul</a> [official profile] told reporters that Rahim had been "communicating with and spreading" IS group propaganda on the Internet. He stated, ""These cases are a reminder of the dangers posed by individuals radicalized through social media." The police showed the video to various community leaders on Wednesday. Rahim's brother disputes the officers' account of the incident, claiming that his brother had been shot in the back. However, the video footage allegedly refutes this claim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Anwar Gabri of the Egyptian <a href="http://www.cc.gov.eg/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Arabic] ordered a retrial on Thursday for former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] regarding his complicity in the killings of hundreds of protestors in the 2011 demonstrations that ousted his regime. This order <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/egyptian-court-orders-mubarak-retrial-for-complicity-in-protesters-deaths-1433411041">overturns his acquittal</a> [WSJ report] by Cairo's Criminal Court last November, and he is set to stand trial again beginning November 5. Mubarak was separately <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-mubarak-to-three-years-in-prison.php">convicted of corruption</a> [JURIST report] earlier this year and sentenced to three years in prison. The Cassation Court upheld the rulings in other cases that acquitted Mubarak and his sons of graft charges. Opponents of Mubarak <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/us-egypt-mubarak-idUSKBN0OK0L720150604">view this decision for retrial as a victory</a> [Reuters report] in a court system that has been too lenient, but his supporters claim there can be no stability in the region while Mubarak is treated "unfairly." This retrial marks the third time this case will be heard, but its verdict will be the final verdict in this case.</p>

<p>Mubarak and other members of his administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In April an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-court-opens-mubarak-retrial-in-corruption-case.php">began the retrial</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak and his two sons for corruption charges of taking public funds to upgrade family property. In January a court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/mubarak-fraud-conviction-overturned-dnp.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the May 2014 convictions of embezzlement for former president Mubarak and ordered a retrial. In December 2013 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/former-egypt-pm-sons-of-mubarak-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Egyptian prime minister and presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq and Alaa and Gamal Mubarak of charges of embezzling public funds. In August 2013 Mubarak appeared in court for his first <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/mubarak-appears-in-court-for-retrial.php">retrial on complicity charges</a> [JURIST report] in the killing of more than 100 protesters during Egypt's 2011 uprising. The same week Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/mubarak-placed-under-house-arrest.php">released from prison and placed under house arrest</a> [JURIST report] at a military hospital after a court concluded that he served the maximum in time allowed in connection with the long-pending corruption case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/">North Carolina legislature</a> [official website] gave <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/voteHistory/RollCallVoteTranscript.pl?sSession=2015&sChamber=H&RCS=682">final approval</a> [roll call] on Wednesday to the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/PDF/H465v4.pdf">Women and Children's Protection Act of 2015</a> [bill, PDF], which mandates a 72-hour waiting period for abortions after a woman has been informed by a physician of her options and the risks of the procedure, except in the case of a medical emergency. The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans since 2011, passed the bill with a wide enough margin to overturn a veto. Only Missouri, Utah and South Dakota <a href="http://time.com/3908444/north-carolina-abortion-wait-period-bill/">currently have 72-hour</a> [TIME report] waiting period requirements, and Oklahoma's waiting period of that length <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/oklahoma-governor-signs-abortion-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period.php">goes into effect</a> [JURIST report] this November. The bill also expanded the definition of statutory rape to include victims aged 15 or younger, requires doctors to supply the state with more data on second-trimester abortions and mandates all ambulatory surgical centers performing abortions must be inspected yearly. North Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website] has announced that he <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20150603/governor-mccrory-releases-statement-recent-legislation">plans to sign the bill into law</a> [press release].</p>

<p><a href="/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-idaho-abortion-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two parts of Idaho abortion laws-one which banned all abortions after 20 weeks, and one that required women seeking abortions in their second trimester to do so in a hospital. Also last month Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/tennessee-adopts-48-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">adopted a law</a> [JURIST report] that requires 48-hour waiting periods for women seeking an abortion. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. Also in April <a href="https://governor.ks.gov">Kansas Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2015/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-signs-seven-bills-into-law">signed a bill</a> [press release] that bans all forms of dismemberment abortion unless necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers in the state to tell women that they can reverse the effects of a drug-induced abortion, in addition to barring women from buying any healthcare plan through the federal marketplace that includes coverage for abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Colombia's Congress voted on Wednesday to limit presidents to a single term, a measure backed by <a href="http://www.santospresidente.com">President Juan Manuel Santos</a> [official website, in Spanish]. The presidential term limit undoes a law passed by Santos' predecessor and rival, Alvaro Uribe, and reverts to the term limits that were in place before 2005. Santos ran against his former mentor in 2010 and was re-elected last year but vowed to get rid of the constitutional reform passed under Uribe's leadership. The measure passed amid strong opposition from the Democratic Center party, led by Uribe. Surveys show that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/colombia-limits-presidents-single-term-205427950.html">more than 70 percent of Colombians disfavor</a> [AP report] presidential re-elections due to abuse of power. Santos split from Uribe when Santos opened up talks with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=farc">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [JURIST backgrounder] in November 2012. </p>

<p>Santos has pushed for reform in Colombia during his tenure. In April the Colombian government modified proposed legislation that would have allowed an <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/colombia-modifies-bill-limiting-military-court-power.php">expansion of the military courts'</a> [JURIST report] jurisdiction and power. The modified bill now ensures that all human rights abuses will remain in the jurisdiction of civilian court, by limiting military courts jurisdiction to cover homicide, breaches of international humanitarian law and crimes against public security. In March Santos and FARC agreed that the military will work with the rebels to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/colombia-and-farc-rebels-agree-to-jointly-remove-landmines-from-rural-areas.php">remove landmines</a> [JURIST report] as well as any other explosives, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Colombia has become one of the most mined countries in the world after over 60 years of fighting between the two sides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EU lawyer: unemployed migrants not entitled to social benefits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A top EU legal adviser <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30dd6866914224dd48cc95599ed4f76e380b.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuQahv0?text=&docid=164741&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=666054">stated</a> [opinion] on Thursday that unemployed EU migrants are not automatically entitled to social benefits during their first three months in a different EU country. The recommendation came from the advocate general of the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">Court of Justice</a> [official website]. Germany had asked the court to review the case of a Spanish man who had arrived in Germany with his son in June 2012 and was denied benefits for the following August and September. Advocate General Melchior Wathelet stated, "EU citizens who move to a member state of which they are not nationals may be excluded from entitlement to certain social benefits during the first three months. ... Since the member states cannot require EU citizens to have sufficient means of subsistence and personal medical cover for a three-month stay, it is legitimate not to require member states to be responsible for them during that period." However, he did note that an EU migrants who were actively seeking work within those three months could seek other benefits. The Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, but the court generally rules according to his findings.</p>

<p>Immigration reform has been a major political concern in a number of countries throughout the globe. In November UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/uk-pm-threatens-to-leave-eu-if-no-welfare-payments-changes-allowed.php">raised the possibility</a> [JURIST report] of the UK leaving the EU if other member state leaders blocked plans to restrict access to welfare payments for migrants.The recommendation from Wathelet could help Britain in this particular situation. Also in November US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">announced executive action</a> [JURIST report] on immigration that would allow 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the US. In October 2014 UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants Francois Crepea <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-expert-criticizes-uk-for-halting-search-and-rescue-efforts-in-mediterranean.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] British authorities to reconsider their decision not to support search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. In September the Israeli High Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/israeli-court-orders-shut-down-of-detention-center-for-african-migrants.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a detention center used to detain African migrants who had crossed illegally and were captured in the Negev Desert to close.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN torture prevention body on Wednesday urged the Philippines to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16033&LangID=E">tackle urgent prison overcrowding</a> [press release] issues and improve independent monitoring of detention facilities. During a visit by the six-member delegation, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/OPCAT/Pages/OPCATIndex.aspx">Sub-Committee on the Prevention of Torture</a> (SPT) [official website] presented its confidential preliminary observations to the Filipino authorities. Their goal is to protect people deprived of their liberty against torture and cruel treatment. The SPT is also trying to persuade the Philippines to enact a law that would establish an effective national independent monitoring body, known as a national preventive mechanism (NPM). While the experts were visiting the Philippines, they visited police stations, pre-trial facilities, prisons, a juvenile rehabilitation centre, correctional institute for women and a psychiatric hospital. Members of the delegation interviewed staff members and met with relevant government authorities. Following the visit, the SPT will submit a report to the government containing its observations and recommendations on prevention of torture and ill-treatment of persons.</p>

<p>In April the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] announced that <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-drugs-and-crime-office-spotlights-prison-overcrowding-epidemic.php">prison overcrowding has reached "epidemic proportions"</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. In July the French Senate <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/france-lawmakers-adopt-measure-to-reduce-prison-overcrowding.php">adopted a measure</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to reduce prison overcrowding. In August 2013 the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/italy-parliament-approves-measure-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">approved a measure</a> [JURIST report] to ease some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe by cutting pre-trial detentions and using alternative punishments for minor offenses. The move came after the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/eu-court-rules-italy-prison-overcrowding-violates-rights.php">ordered Italy to address the problem</a> [JURIST report] within a year. In August 2012 the Colombian Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/colombia-transfers-inmates-to-solve-prison-overcrowding-problem.php">announced a new initiative</a> [JURIST report] to solve the problem of overcrowding in the nation's prisons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a>, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy websitew] filed a <a href="http://ppfa.pr-optout.com/ViewAttachment.aspx?EID=mr9WXYw4u2IxYnni1dBRVmnOF5LmyPHxgRvDlh4a6To%3d">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday in federal court to block part of a new Arizona law that requires doctors to tell patients that it may be possible to reverse a drug-induced abortion. This advice is regarded by most medical experts as wrong and misleading. The lawsuit argues that requiring doctors to make such statements with severe consequences if they do not comply is a violation of their First Amendment rights. "This reckless law forces doctors to lie to their patients, and it puts women's health at risk,"<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/04/lawsuit-challenges-controversial-provision-in-arizona-abortion-law">said</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. "This law should never have passed, and we're asking the court to stop it from going into effect." The main purpose of the law is to stop women from using the federal marketplace to purchase a health care plan that covers abortions. The law is scheduled to take effect July 3.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in Arizona have been a divisive issue for the state recently. In March Arizona Governor Doug Ducey <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/arizona-governor-signs-controversial-abortion-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the bill requiring doctor disclosure of a possible reversal into law. "The American people overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortions, and it's no different in Arizona, where we have long-standing policy against subsidizing them with public dollars," said Ducey in a press release. "This legislation provides clarity to state law."  In April 2014 the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/federal-appeals-cout-temporarily-blocks-arizona-abortion-drug-rules.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] Arizona from enforcing HB 2306, which would prohibit women from having a medication abortion after seven weeks of pregnancy. The proposed law is considered to be one of the strictest in the country. In December the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-declines-review-of-injunction-in-arizona-abortion-case.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] the injunction preventing the implementation of Arizona's HB 2306.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] announced Wednesday that in light of allegations of sexual abuse in the Central African Republic (CAR) by foreign troops not under UN control, an External Independent Review will be set up to examine the UN's handling of such allegations. According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8699">statement</a> [text] issued by the Secretary-General's office, the External Independent Review will look into how the UN responded to this "specific report of abuse in the Central African Republic as well as a broad range of systemic issues related to how the UN responds to serious information of this kind." The statement claims Ban's "intention in setting up this review is to ensure that the United Nations does not fail the victims of sexual abuse, especially when committed by those who are meant to protect them." The allegations stem from reports of<a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51046&Cr=central+african+republic&Cr1=#.VXG-FmDxEsE"> sexual abuse of children</a> [UN News Centre report] in the CAR by troops not administered by the UN. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, in May called on several states to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-of-car-peacekeepers.php">investigate allegations</a> [JURIST report] that members of their peacekeeping forces sent to the CAR have committed serious human rights violations. It is reported that soldiers have engaged in the killing of civilians, summary executions, abductions and sexual exploitation of local women and children. Violence has persisted in the CAR for the past two years, escalating after the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted the government of Bozize in March 2013. According to UN estimates, nearly 440,000 people remain displaced in the country while 190,000 others have sought asylum outside its borders. In April the CAR government <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/central-african-republic-government-establishes-special-criminal-court.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to create a Special Criminal Court to investigate the atrocities committed during recent unrest in the country. In September the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-prosecutor-opens-second-investigation-into-central-african-republic-war-crimes.php">opened </a>[JURIST report] a second investigation into CAR war crimes. Members of the international community maintain that there is much <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">appeals court in New York</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad2/calendar/webcal/decisions/2015/D45607.pdf">granted a law license</a> [opinion] to an immigrant who was brought to the US illegally as a child. Cesar Vargas was brought to the US from Mexico by his mother when he was 5 years old. He attended college and law school in New York City and passed the bar exam. Vargas is eligible to work in the US under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that gives work status and defers deportation action for some immigrants. The court determined that it had "no legal impediment or rational basis for withholding the privilege of practicing law in the state of New York from undocumented immigrants who have been granted DACA relief." Vargas, and many other activists who push for changes to immigration laws, view this decision as a major advance in immigrants' rights.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">US immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a controversial issue, especially in dealing with undocumented immigrants. In January 2014 the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/california-top-court-grants-law-license-to-immigrant-in-country-illegally.php">granted a law license</a> [JURIST report] to Sergio Garcia, who came to the country from Mexico as a teenager. That ruling came after California passed a law allowing immigrants in the country without legal documentation to get a law license. A couple of months later, Florida's state Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/florida-supreme-court.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Tampa Immigrant Jose Godinez-Samperio, and other immigrants in the country illegally, could not be given law licenses to practice in the state. Also in 2014 a New Jersey governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing undocumented immigrants to claim in-state tuition. In November 2013 the mayor of Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/dc-mayor-signs-bill-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants. In April 2013 Oregon's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/oregon-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public universities at the same tuition rate as in-state residents. In March of that year a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">permanently blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://senate.ca.gov">California Senate</a> [official website] on Thursday voted 23-14 to approve a controversial <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB128">right to die bill</a> [SB 128 materials]. The bill would protect doctors who aide individuals with terminal conditions in dying. The bill's impact is limited to patients who pass a mental competency test are have less than six months to live. The patients would also be given the option to self administer. The California bill is modeled after Oregon's law, which more than 750 people have used to assist in death since it was passed. Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula stated he is worried that California will be known for <a href="http://time.com/3910191/california-right-to-die-legislation-bill/">death tourism</a> [AP report] if the law passes. The bill now goes before the state Assembly.</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue in the US and around the world. In April a South African judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/terminally-ill-man-granted-right-to-die-in-south-africa.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a terminally ill man has a right to assisted suicide with no legal or professional consequences for the participating doctor. In February the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/canadian-supreme-court-authorizes-medically-assisted-suicide.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the country's ban on medically assisted suicide. Also that month a group of patients and doctors filed a lawsuit in a New York court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/new-york-doctors-patients-file-assisted-suicide-lawsuit.php">requesting a declaration</a> [JURIST report] that physician-assisted suicide is not illegal under New York state law. In 2006 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], making Oregon the only US state that allowed assisted suicide at that time. Vermont, Washington, New Mexico and Montana now also allow assisted suicide. Possibly the most contentious right to die case ended in 2005, when <a href="/forum/2005/12/living-and-dying-in-post-schiavo-world.php">Terri Schiavo</a> [JURIST op-ed] passed away following a heated legal battle between family members on whether to artificially maintain her life in a vegetative state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lambert was in a car accident seven years ago that caused him to become quadriplegic, and he has been in a coma since. The case was taken to the human rights court last year after a French court ruled in favor of ending Lambert's life support. Doctors said that Lambert showed signs of resisting his treatment, and his wife stated that he would never have wanted "to live this way." Lambert's parents, devout Roman Catholics, disagreed with the decision by the French court last year and have stated they will continue to fight decision to end their son's life. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The chief judge for the <a href="http://www.gud.uscourts.gov/?q=node/490">US District Court of Guam</a> [official website] on Friday struck down the territory's same-sex marriage ban. The ruling came in a <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/04/4-13-15-Complaint-for-Declaratory-and-Injunctive-Relief.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] filed in April by same-sex couple Kathleen Aguero and Loretta Pangelinan after they were denied a marriage license. Chief Judge Frances Tydingco-Gatewood <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/06/05/guam-becomes-first-us-territory-to-recognize-gay-marriage">ruled from the bench</a> [AP report] after a hearing Friday morning, finding the ban violates the couple's right to equal protection under the law. The ruling is set to take effect Tuesday morning. A written decision is expected to follow.</p>

<p>In April Guam's attorney general directed officials to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/guam-ag-directs-issuance-of-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">begin processing same-sex marriage applications</a> [JURIST report], but the Department of Public Health and Social Services refused the request until a legal opinion was released. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage by the end of June. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The top human rights official,<a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186"> Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein</a> [official profile], in a statement <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20150605-nigeria-un-probe-boko-haram-crimes">said</a> [Reuters report], "Civilians in northeast Nigeria have been living through horrifying acts of cruelty and violence by Boko Haram. These include wanton killings, summary executions, forced participation in military operations - including the use of children to detonate bombs, forced labour, forced marriage and sexual violence, including rape." There have also been reports that many civilians have suffered abuses by military forces, who have been detaining them in what<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/"> Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has called a "witch hunt" to locate and fight members of Boko Haram. AI also <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/amnesty-nigeria-military-forces-committing-crimes-against-humanity.php">called on Buhari</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to investigate into any possible crimes committed at these detention camps. </p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boko+haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. Two weeks ago the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, reported that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">murdering women and girls</a> [JURIST report] previously taken captive by the group. At the end of March Nigeria held its presidential and gubernatorial elections in spite of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/nigeria-holds-presidential-elections-amid-violence.php">violent attacks directed towards voters</a> [JURIST report] by Boko Haram. The elections, originally scheduled for February 14, were <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/nigeria-elections-postponed-following-boko-haram-v/?page=all">postponed </a>[<em>Washington Times</em> report] as Nigeria attempted to eradicate Boko Haram after reports that the group had acquired military-grade weaponry, including armored personnel carriers. In February the UN reported that <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">girls have been attacked</a> [JURIST report] and been subjected to gender oppression in at least 70 countries for seeking an education. In January the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-security-council-condemns-boko-haram-attacks.php">condemned attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria </a>[JURIST report] and called for an end to terrorist attacks and the release of abducted child soldiers. The hostilities included mass killings, destruction of civilian homes and suicide bombings where children where induced to carry out the attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenyan police on Thursday charged five men in connection with the attack on Garissa University by al-Shabaab militants in April. The attack by Somali Islamist gunmen killed 148 students, making it the nation's worst militant attack in nearly 20 years. While the four gunmen involved in the attack were killed by police who responded to the attack, the prosecution alleges that these five colluded to carry it out. Their roles in the attack have not yet been specified. The men <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/suspects-charged-kenya-university-massacre-150605040855190.html">pleaded not guilty</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] in Nairobi court to 152 counts of committing acts of terrorism. They will be imprisoned until June 11 under the order of Magistrate Daniel Ochenja, at which time the court will determine whether to grant or deny them bail. The men claim that anti-terrorism police tortured them for ten days in an attempt to make them confess. They are the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/05/uk-kenya-security-idUKKBN0OL1AC20150605">first to face charges</a> [Reuters report] over the attack.</p>

<p>A Nairobi court in April <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/5-kenyans-1-tanzanian-detained-over-kenya-university-massacre.php">ordered the 30 day detention</a> [JURIST report] of five Kenyan citizens and a Tanzanian while authorities investigated possible connections to the university massacre. Four of the Kenyan men and the Tanzanian man were ultimately charged. Lawyers for the police said that the five Kenyan citizens were being investigated for supplying the attackers with weapons but did not give further details, while the Tanzanian citizen, who worked as a security guard on the campus, was found "hiding in the ceiling" of a university building and holding a grenade. The give Kenyan citizens were arrested while trying to cross the border to Somalia. Al Qaeda linked militant group al-Shabaab has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/05/africa/kenya-attack/">claimed responsibility</a> [CNN report] for the attack, with alleged al-Shabaab commander Mohamed Mohamud thought to be the mastermind behind it. The Islamist group <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/04/04/397456989/5-arrested-in-kenyan-attack-as-al-shabab-promises-bloodbath">said </a>[NPR report] that the attack was in retaliation for the participation of Kenyan forces in an African Union force against it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani police on Friday <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/06/05/malala-attack-pakistan-acquittal/28537169/">announced</a> [AP report] that eight of the ten men charged with the 2012 attack of teenage education activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23241937">Malala Yousafzai</a> [BBC profile] were acquitted of all charges by an anti-terrorism court in April. This information is a correction of the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistan-court-jails-10-for-life-for-malala-yousafzai-attack.php">reported conviction</a> [JURIST report] of all ten militants to life in prison for their involvement in the attack. It is unknown why the police and public officials waited to release an accurate account of the closed trial proceedings. It is now reported that only two of the men were sentenced to life in prison while the other eight men were acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The prosecutor, Sayed Naeem, claims to have been misquoted following the trial and has filed an appeal of the acquittal of the eight men. The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/breaking-down-tehreek-e-taliban-2013112121349713830.html">Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan</a> (TTP) [Al Jazeera backgrounder] claimed responsibility for the attack and the men on trial allegedly assisted in planning the assassination attempt. </p>

<p>Yousafzai was awarded the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2014/press.html">2014 Nobel Peace Prize</a> [press release] for her campaign for children's rights. She runs an international organization called the <a href="http://www.malala.org/">Malala Fund</a> [advocacy website] to advocate for all girls to have the right to receive an education around the world. Yousafzai, now 17, was targeted for rallying against the Taliban's efforts to keep young girls from receiving an education and against militants operating in the Pashtun area of Pakistan. Two other girls were injured in the shooting, but Yousafzai's injuries were the most critical. After the attack she received treatment in the UK and remains there today. She and her family cannot return to Pakistan due to many Taliban death threats. Several of the actual gunmen from the attack are believed to have fled across the border into Afghanistan, and Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah is wanted in connection with the crime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Louisiana legislature approves medical marijuana bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://house.louisiana.gov/">Louisiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a medical marijuana <a href="http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=226928">bill</a> [legislative materials] on Thursday and sent the bill as amended back to the Senate for concurrence. The Senate previously approved the bill that seeks to provide a legal way to supply therapeutic marijuana to patients who need it in May. The current system allows doctors to prescribe marijuana and patients to use it, but lacks legal guidelines for marijuana providers. The bill gives authority to three state boards to set rules to regulate the distribution system. If the Senate approves the bill as amended, it will be sent to <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/">Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website] who <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/medical_marijuana_jindal_sign.html">expressed</a> [NOLA report] his intent to sign the bill if it reaches his desk.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes has created controversy among a number of states in the US in the past few years. In May the Pennsylvania Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a similar medical marijuana bill that would allow medical marijuana products to be grown by licensed cultivation facilities and distributed through state-regulated dispensaries. Also in May Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/puerto-rico-governor-signs-executive-order-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order legalizing medical marijuana. The order referred to several US studies that show the therapeutic use of the plant in treating different medical conditions including pain associated with AIDS, glaucoma, migraines, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases. The Governor further noted that several US states have already legalized medical marijuana for these uses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Saudi court on Sunday upheld blogger Raif Badawi's sentence of 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for "insulting Islam through electronic channels." The blogger ran The Liberal Saudi Network for 4 years before being arrested by Saudi authorities.  Badawi was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33039815">originally charged</a> [BBC report] with insulting Islam for co-founding the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals. He was detained in June 2012, and his case was referred to the Public Court of Jeddah in December with a recommendation to try him for the crime of apostasy. Shariah-based Saudi law is not codified and judges do not follow a system of precedent, however apostasy is a capital offense which can be punishable by death. The blogger received his first 50 lashes in January, but floggings have been delayed since, for reasons that have not been made public. A medical report shows that he was not fit for punishment. Saudi Arabia uses a strict form of Islamic law which does not tolerate political dissent.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's justice system has drawn international criticism for perceived human rights abuses in recent years. In January 2015, a Saudi judge sentenced prominent human rights lawyer Walid Abu al-Khair <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/saudi-arabia-increases-prison-sentence-for-human-rights-lawyer.php">to an additional five years in jail</a> [JURIST report] after he refused to show remorse for "showing disrespect" to authorities and creating an unauthorized association.  In December 2014, a Saudi court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/saudi-arabia-women-activists-arrested-for-driving-transferred-to-terrorism-tribunal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the criminal cases against two women's rights activists be transferred to a special tribunal for terrorism. The women were arrested for attempting to drive into Saudi Arabia from the UAE. In October a Saudi Arabia Court sentenced three lawyers to between five and eight years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-3-lawyers-for-criticizing-judiciary.php">criticizing the justice system</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter by accusing authorities of carrying out arbitrary detentions. Earlier that month Amnesty International issued a report claiming that <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/rights-group-condemns-saudi-arabia-persecution-of-activists.php">Saudi Arabia persecutes rights activists and silences government critics </a>[JURIST report], especially in the years since the Arab Spring in 2011. Saudi Arabia has also faced sharp criticism for its high number of executions. In September two experts from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-rights-experts-urge-saudi-arabia-to-place-moratorium-on-executions.php">urged Saudi Arabia to implement an immediate moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] following an increase in executions, with a significant number of the executions completed by beheading. In July then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navy Pillay, expressed deep concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-arrests-of-saudi-arabia-activists.php">harsh sentences and detention of peaceful human rights advocates </a>[JURIST report] in Saudi Arabia in recent months. In February 2014 JURIST Guest Columnist Adam Coogle of Human Rights Watch <a href="/hotline/2014/02/adam-coogle-terrorism-due-process.php">argued that a new Saudi Arabian terrorism law was a vague, catch-all document</a> [JURIST op-ed] that can&#8212;and probably will&#8212;be used to prosecute or jail anyone who criticizes the Saudi government and to violate their due process rights along the way.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] on Saturday <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8703">invited</a> [official statement] Yemen President Abd Rabou Mansour Hadi to send a delegation to the UN sponsored Yemen consultation set to begin in Geneva on June 14th. The Secretary General has called on all parties to participate in good faith and without an preconceived notions for the interest of all Yemeni people.  He stated that he "hopes that the meeting in Geneva will restart a peaceful, orderly, inclusive and Yemeni-led transition process" based on Security Council resolutions. The need for a peaceful resolution is even more important, it was noted, with the conflict continuing to increase dramatically. The Secretary General has asked the international community to continue to contribute to the UN's efforts in helping the Yemeni people and reducing civilian suffering.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounder; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">JURIST news archive</a>] has sparked significant international concern. In April Human Rights Watch condemned the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-yemen-combatants-must-stop-targeting-hospitals.php">targeting</a> [JURIST report] of the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in Yemen by combatants. Also that month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-calls-on-yemen-combatants-to-allow-investigation-of-civilian-cas.php">urged Yemeni combatants</a> [JURIST report] to report attacks resulting in civilian casualties so that they can be investigated and international human rights law can be upheld. Also in April the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)</a> and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC)</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-lawsuit-filed-against-state-department-for-failing-to-evacuate-us-citizens-in-yemen.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] on behalf of US citizens still in Yemen against the US State Department and the Department of Defense for allegedly failing to launch an evacuation plan. The same week, in a unanimous vote, Pakistani lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/pakistani-lawmakers-vote-against-entering-yemen-conflict.php">passed a resolution </a>[JURIST report] to stay out of the conflict in Yemen, despite pleas from Saudi Arabia for aid in the form of warships, aircraft and ground troops. Earlier in April, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons Chaloka Beyani <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-expert-warns-of-displacement-from-yemen-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prepare itself for the "massive displacement and humanitarian crisis" that could come as a result of civilians fleeing the fighting in Yemen, stating that they must prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A British warship sailing in the Mediterranean Sea launched a mission on Sunday to rescue over 500 migrants stranded at sea, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defense</a> (MoD) [official website] said in a statement. A Royal Navy helicopter has found four migrant vessels in need of assistance so far. It was also reported by the <a href="http://www.moas.eu/">Migrant Offshore Aid Station</a> (MOAS) [official website] and the Italian coastguard that on Saturday over 2,000 migrants were rescued from five wooden boats in the Mediterranean and there have been reports of seven or more similar boats still currently out at sea. Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/michael-fallon">Michael Fallon</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hms-bulwark-conducts-largest-rescue-to-date">visited</a> [MoD report] the ship, the HMS Bulwark, on Sunday. During his visit, he praised the Navy's efforts in the search and rescue operation which has by itself rescued over 2,700 migrants. Mr. Fallon said, "HMS Bulwark continues to play a vital role saving lives at sea and I want to thank them for their unwavering efforts... However, we cannot simply deal with the symptoms of this problem; we must go after the route cause and the trafficking gangs behind it who are making money out of human misery."</p>

<p>Refuges from the conflicts in the Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. Also in April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-court-opens-investigation-into-cueta-migrant-drowning-incident.php">accused 16 civil guards</a> [JURIST report] of using excessive force against 15 sub-Saharan immigrants who drowned attempting to swim around a seawall between Ceuta and Morocco last February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Burundi opposition leader <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/201381172611527791.html">Agathon Rwasa</a> [Aljazeera backgrounder] on Saturday said that a presidential election must be held by August so that a newly elected government is in place by the time current president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13085065">Pierre Nkurunziza's</a> [BBC profile] term ends August 26. Currently there is an election planned for June 26, but the likelihood of it taking place has greatly diminished amid months of protesting against Nkurunziza. Even smaller local elections have been postponed due to such protests in which over 30 people have been killed. In an interview with Reuters, Rwasa <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/06/uk-burundi-politics-idUKKBN0OM0V220150606">said</a> [Reuters report], "There is no room for a transitional government. We will have to comply with the constitution. We knew ahead of these elections that we should hold it so that we can have a newly elected president, and MPs and so on, by August this year." Those opposing Nkurunziza's bid for a third presidential term claim that both the constitution and the <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/cdburundipeaceagreements/No%201%20arusha.pdf">Arusha peace deal</a> [agreement, PDF] that ended the 2005 civil war state that no one should be president for more than 10 years. Those backing Nkurunziza claim that this does not apply to him since he was not voted in for his first term but selected by lawmakers.</p>

<p>Burundi has faced unrest since Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in April. The unrest intensified in May after the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">ruled that he could seek a third term</a> [JURIST report] in office without violating the country's constitution, which states that presidents shall be universally elected into office for a term of five years and can renew the term once. Also in May Burundi authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/burundi-police-arrest-opposition-leader-for-meeting-with-african-delegates.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] political opposition leader Audifax Ndabitoreye shortly after he met with East African Community ministers in the capital city of Bujumbura. In April the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-concerned-over-burundi-suppression-of-free-speech-ahead-of-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over actions by Burundian authorities ahead of its upcoming presidential elections.The OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-burundi-must-take-path-to-democracy-in-series-of-upcoming-elections.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the upcoming elections in Burundi place the nation at a critical moment in history, urging the nation to choose democracy in the elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060815zor_8m58.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in three cases Monday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-990.htm">Shapiro v. Mack</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Shapiro-v-Mack-petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will hear a challenge to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2284">Three Judge Court Act</a> [28 USC § 2284], which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. The court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12413275380559237224&q=goosby+v.+osser&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Goosby v. Osser</a> (1973) [opinion] that a three-judge court is not required when the claim is "insubstantial." The question before the court is, "May a single-judge district court determine that a complaint covered by 28 USC § 2284 is insubstantial, and that three judges therefore are not required, not because it concludes that the complaint is wholly frivolous, but because it concludes that the complaint fails to state a claim under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12">Rule 12(b)(6)</a> [text]?"</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-419.htm">Luis v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PETITION-for-writ-of-certiorari-10-7-14.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine "whether the pretrial restraint of a criminal defendant's legitimate, untainted assets (those not traceable to a criminal offense) needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments." There is a circuit split on the issue.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1146.htm">Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1146.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court is asked to address two questions:<blockquote><ol><br />
	<li>Whether differences among individual class members may be ignored and a class action certified under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3)</a> [text], or a collective action certified under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> [materials], where liability and damages will be determined with statistical techniques that presume all class members are identical to the average observed in a sample.</li><br />
	<li>Whether a class action may be certified or maintained under Rule 23(b)(3), or a collective action certified under the Fair Labor Standards Act, when the class contains hundreds of members who were not injured and have no legal right to any damages.</li><br />
</ol></blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The hostilities in Afghanistan are leading to the killing and wounding of thousands and the forced relocation of families into neighboring countries, according to <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12259&language=en-US">Mark Bowden</a> [official profile], the UN Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, in <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12254&ctl=Details&mid=15756&ItemID=38779&language=en-US">statements</a> [press release] made on Monday. While addressing the Second Independent Media and Civil Society Forum in Kabul, Bowden stated that doctors in Kabul have seen an 50 percent increase in the number of civilians visiting the hospital for conflict-related injuries than at the same time last year. He also noted that humanitarian aid workers are becoming targets themselves in Afghanistan. However, Bowden stressed that "It is through its engagement with the media that civil society can advocate more strongly about the conflict and the resulting humanitarian situation." Bowden also serves as the deputy head of the <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA), a mission dedicated to helping achieve the freedoms and human rights provisions set out in the <a href="http://www.afghanembassy.com.pl/afg/images/pliki/TheConstitution.pdf">Afghan Constitution</a> [PDF]. </p>

<p>Human rights groups have criticized Afghanistan's record in recent years. In April UNAMA and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-afghanistan-should-strengthen-justice-system-to-protect-women.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] urging Afghanistan to strengthen its criminal justice system to protect women from domestic violence. Also in April an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] report <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Afghanistan women's rights activists are facing increased violence and a lack of governmental support. In March UNAMA also released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">report</a> [JURIST report] indicating a 22 percent increase in civilian causalities in 2014, making 2014 the deadliest year in Afghanistan since 2009. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-calls-for-protection-of-womens-rights-in-afghanistan.php">called on the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address violence against women in the country. UNAMA and the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">released a study</a> [JURIST report] last year that raised concern over the treatment of women in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration">Obama administration</a> [official website] sent a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/international/2015/egyptwaiver.pdf">formal report</a> [text, PDF] to Congress criticizing the Egyptian government for its human rights abuses and lack of movement toward democracy but still supporting sending $1.3 billion to Egypt in mostly military aid. The report, signed by <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/world/middleeast/obama-administration-criticizes-egypt-in-report-to-congress.html?_r=0">submitted quietly</a> [NYT report] on May 12, condemned Egypt's due process restrictions and a "lack of fair trial safeguards," pointing to mass trials, mass death sentences and extremely poor prison conditions. Government agents and police have largely not been held responsible for human rights violations. Current laws seem to "effectively ban ... most forms of street protest ... including peaceful dissent." While Egypt has a general "democracy roadmap" that has been implemented in part, "the overall trajectory of rights and democracy has been negative." Ultimately, however, the report cites Egypt's counterterrorism efforts and public support against the Islamic State as key reasons why Egypt remains of "vital importance" to the US from a security perspective. Egypt's economic prosperity also affects the vitality of other country's in the region. Therefore, the report recommends continued economic support to Egypt despite the growing list of humanitarian grievances.</p>

<p>Egyptian laws have been under much scrutiny in recent years. In March <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-egypt-should-reject-amendments-threatening-fair-trials.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian president to reject criminal procedure amendments that would threaten fair trials. Also in March a judge for Egypt's Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-strikes-down-part-of-election-law.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the country's upcoming parliamentary elections indefinitely after another court declared the election law's provision on voting districts unconstitutional. These elections would mark the first time the country has an acting legislature since the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-high-court-dissolves-parliament.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the parliament in June 2012 after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported in January that the Egyptian government is failing to protect women's rights and end violence against women. Egyptian authorities have passed laws that criminalize violent acts toward women, but AI reported that the failure to recognize the wide scale problem and implement the new laws has allowed the violence to continue. Egypt's protest laws have also come under criticism recently, and in January, Egypt's <a href="http://www.cc.gov.eg/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Arabic] upheld the convictions and three-year prison sentences of three activists for <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/egypt-court-upholds-convictions-against-3-prominent-activists.php">violating</a> [JURIST report] these laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Eritrean government has committed "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations," according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIEritrea/Pages/ReportCoIEritrea.aspx">report</a> [materials] released Monday by a panel of UN investigators. The investigators were denied access to Eritrea but were able to conduct their investigation through confidential interviews and submissions. The report asserts that the Eritrean government, led by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13349076">President Isaias Afwerki</a> [BBC profile], has imposed a culture of fear through the restriction of many essential freedoms, including maintaining constant surveillance of citizens, placing heavy burdens on the ability to exit the nation, repressing dissenting opinions and controlling religious practices. The report also claims that Eritrea is ruled arbitrarily as there is no independent parliament or court system. Arrests are allegedly arbitrary and backed by information provided through spying networks, and violations of trial rights and due process abound. Detainees are also often subjected to enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions. According to the investigators, the have caused a record number of Eritreans to attempt to flee the country. The report implores neighboring nations to protect Eritrean asylum seekers, as returning to their homeland would most likely mean death. </p>

<p>Eritrea has faced much criticism from the international community for continued abuses of human rights. In 2013 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-urges-eritrea-to-stop-human-rights-violations.php">called</a> for an end to human rights abuses in Eritrea and appealed to the international community to increase their <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-increased-scrutiny-in-eritrea.php">scrutiny</a> [JURIST reports] of the nation. The UN also pleaded for <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-international-community-to-aid-eritrea-refugees.php">aid</a> [JURIST report] for Eritrean refugees, as denial of asylum would most likely condemn them to death, based on the country's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.53_ENG.pdf">shoot to kill order</a> [report, PDF] for anyone attempting to leave the country illegally. In late 2013, a report from Dutch and Swedish researchers discovered that officers of the Eritrean military were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/report-finds-eritreas-military-involved-in-human-trafficking-to-sudan.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] and smuggling them into Sudan. In March of this year, another UN commission released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-commission-reports-human-rights-violations-in-eritrea.php">report</a> [JURIST report] which found that the various human rights abuses found in Eritrea included torture, a large number of detentions, and paltry wages insufficient for an adequate standard of living. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, was indicted by a grand jury on Monday on murder charges brought after the April incident in which the officer shot an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, who was running away from him. The case gained prominence after a<a href="https://twitter.com/postandcourier/status/585563785794035712"> video</a> [Post and Courier report] was released in which the graphic images of the shooting were plainly visible, causing the officer to be discharged from his position shortly after the incident. Former officer Michael Slager will be tried in North Charleston for murder, which under South Carolina law is defined as "unlawful killing with malice aforethought" and necessitates a premeditation element. Slager faces 30 years to life without parole if convicted. </p>

<p>The video of the encounter between Slager and Scott reignited the debate around the treatment of black men at the hands of white police officers that intensified with the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">death of Michael Brown</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] in Ferguson, Missouri. Police action in Ferguson was characterized by <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] as <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] after military grade tactics were taken against peaceful protesters. Darren Wilson, the officer accused of Michael Brown's death, was <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">not indicted</a> by a Missouri grand jury, nor did he have <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-report-no-prosecution-of-ferguson-police-officer.php">charges</a> brought against him by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060815zor_8m58.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-704.htm">Jackson v. San Francisco</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2014-12-12-NRA-Jackson-Cert-Petition-FINAL-1.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case challenging a <a href="ftp://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/city/ca/SanFrancisco/Police%20Code/article45.pdf">San Francisco law</a> [text, PDF] requiring gun owners to keep handguns "stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock that has been approved by the California Department of Justice." Opponents of the law claim that it essentially renders their guns inoperable, making it impossible for them to defend themselves in the instance of a home invasion. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia voted to review the challenge, stating in a dissent that the California law violates Second Amendment rights. Particularly, the justices said that the law conflicted with the court's prior precedent in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report], a case in which the court held that a law that rendered hand guns inoperable was unconstitutional.

Gun control has been the center of national attention since the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596">Newtown, Connecticut, shooting</a> [WSJ report] in December 2012. Earlier this year Michigan <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/">Governor Rick Snyder</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/Senate_Bills_789_790_Veto_Letter_479116_7.pdf">vetoed</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/michigan-govenor-veteos-gun-legislation.php">report</a>] gun legislation supported by the <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] and approved by both chambers of the Republican-controlled state legislation. Also this year the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/nra-sues-3-pennsylvania-cities-over-local-gun-ordinances.php">NRA sued the City of Pittsburgh</a> [JURIST report] in January alleging a local gun ordinance violated Pennsylvania state law. In March 2013 then-Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging the federal legislature to pass gun control legislation. Also in March 2013 the Maryland Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make it harder to get a gun license. In January 2013 US President Barack Obama announced that he signed <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] to strengthen existing gun laws, as well as put pressure on Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. The previous day, <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that imposed tighter restrictions on gun and ammunition sales, banned any magazine that can hold more than seven rounds and implemented instant background checks on all ammunition purchases at the time of sale.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURSIT] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-628_l5gm.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/zivotofsky-v-kerry/">Zivotofsky v. Kerry</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the Constitution gives the president the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns. Seeking to have his place of birth listed as "Israel" on his passport, Jerusalem-born Menachem Zivotofsky and his family appealed trial and appeals court decisions that refused to grant his request on the grounds that, since 1948, the US has not recognized any country as having sovereignty over the holy city. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court upheld the lower court's finding that § 214(d) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ228/pdf/PLAW-107publ228.pdf">Foreign Relations Authorization Act</a> [text, PDF] was unconstitutional for violating the president's sovereignty in foreign relations. The law, through which Congress ordered the State Department to list Israel as the place of birth for US citizens born in Jerusalem if requested, was previously <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C8DC59BCC7D10E6D85257BB10051786D/$file/07-5347-1447974.pdf">invalidated</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] in 2013. In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito as well, urged that the law was not repugnant to the Constitution, as the document divides foreign relations power between the president and Congress. </p>

<p>The case was first tried in the US District Court for the District of Columbia around 2006. After a ruling in favor of the government, the Zivotofsky family appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which decided the case in 2013. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-listing-of-israel-on-birth-certificate-is-not-a-political-question.php">previously ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 that a citizen's ability to list Israel as a place of birth on a passport is not a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine">political question</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] but remanded the case for a ruling specifically on the issue. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-jerusalem-birthplace-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] on this issue in April 2014. The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-jerusalem-passport-case.php">argument</a> [JURIST report] in November. Although neutral on its face, the decision may have an impact on American-Israel relations in light of the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-israel-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-in-gaza.php">Israel-Palestine conflict</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian authorities on Monday arrested Hamid Baghaei, former vice president under <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-38656">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [Bio profile]. Baghaei's arrest is the second detention of a high-ranking official from the Ahmadinejad administration, as Mohammad Reza Rahimi, another former vice president, was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/iran-court-sentences-former-vice-president-to-5-years-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and embezzlement last year. The recent arrests are part of efforts by <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/hassan-rouhani-21313175">President Hassan Rouhani</a> [Bio profile] to crackdown against alleged widespread corruption stemming from the former administration. Toward the end of the Ahmadinejad administration, multiple individuals close to the president were accused of perpetrating a one billion dollar bribery and embezzlement scheme, which led to death sentences for several conspirators. </p>

<p>Rouhani's attack on corruption comes in light of Iran's <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/iran-agrees-to-framework-of-nuclear-deal.php">recent agreement</a> [JURIST report] on a framework deal to restrict its nuclear plan in return for a reduction of international economic sanctions. Iranian leaders have repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-says-it-will-continue-to-expand.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the developing nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the international community, Israel in particular, worries that Iran's enrichment program was designed for military purposes. Although these concerns about Iran's motives may be assuaged by Rouhani's attack on corruption, the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-journalists-closed-trial-begins-in-iran.php">ongoing trial</a> [JURIST report] of <em>Washington Post</em> correspondent Jason Rezaian gives reason for pause. Rezaian, a US-Iranian dual citizen has been detained in Iran for 10 months on charges of espionage and giving information to hostile governments. He was originally arrested without charges and held in the notorious Evin Prison in solitary confinement for the duration of his imprisonment, and allegedly Iran has presented no evidence to support the charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The families of two Yemeni men who were killed by US drone strikes filed a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/268059329/Bin-Ali-Jaber-families-v-U-S#scribd">lawsuit</a> [complaint] Sunday against the US claiming that the men, Salem bin Ali Jaber and Waleed bin Ali Jaber, were "innocent bystanders" who were wrongfully killed. The lawsuit, which seeks no monetary relief, states that the men were not "likely targets of the strike that killed them," as both men spent their lives preaching against al Qaeda and terrorism. The lawsuit further alleges that the killings were in violation of the <a href="http://www.asil.org/sites/default/files/benchbook/humanrights2.pdf">Torture Victim Prevention Act's ban on extrajudicial killings</a> [text, PDF] and that the government knew within hours that a mistake had been made. The lawsuit specifically names <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a>, former defense secretary, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Leon Panetta</a> former CIA director <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=166">David Petraeus</a> [official profiles] and three unknown defendants.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the US has been involved in a lawsuit concerning drone strikes in Yemen. In 2010 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-awlaki">al-Awlaki Khan</a> [JURIST news archive], a dual US-Yemeni citizen, had been approved for <a href="/feature/2013/08/us-drones-abroad.php">targeted killing</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by the Obama administration, an action that was challenged based on Awlaki's US citizenship. Earlier in 2014 a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/"> US District Court for the District of Columbia</a>  [official website] dismissed a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012cv1192-36">lawsuit</a> [opinion, PDF] brought against officials of the Obama administration for the 2011 drone strikes that killed three US citizens in Yemen. In December 2010 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">reports</a>] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in al-Awlaki's case. Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain. Bates heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November 2010 on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Earlier that month Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged </a>[JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners, and he was later sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ireland's abortion law <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/06/ireland-abortion-vessels/">threatens</a> [press release] the lives of women who choose to remain in the country, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said on Tuesday. Under the country's abortion law, women are only permitted to undergo abortion proceedings if their lives are at risk. AI contends that the law forces more than 4,000 women and girls to travel outside of Ireland for abortions, and those who choose not to travel outside of the country are subject to criminal penalties for seeking abortion inside the country. AI's corresponding <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur29/1597/2015/en/">report</a> [text, PDF] documents specific cases wherein authorities have denied women the right to have an abortion, condemning the law in especially those situations where it is difficult to draw the line between a woman's suffering and potential death. Executive Director of AI Ireland Colm O'Gorman stated:<blockquote>Ireland's draconian laws have created a climate of fear where counsellors can be fined for telling women how to seek medical care, and as a result some women are avoiding doctors altogether.</blockquote>AI also noted that the country's abortion law, as one of the most restrictive in the world, lies in sharp contrast to its recent national referendum <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/ireland-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-by-national-referendum.php">legalizing same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report].</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Abortion</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a continuing controversial topic within the neighboring state of Northern Ireland. In December the High Court of Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/ireland-high-court-rules-pregant-woman-may-be-removed-from-life-support.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a pregnant woman may be removed from life support, concluding that the life of an unborn child must be prioritized. Also that month the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) announced that it <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/rights-group-challenges-northern-ireland-abortion-law.php">planned to file a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the region's law against abortions. Northern Ireland's current abortion law was proposed shortly after the 2013 death of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion. Following her death, Ireland's <a href="http://www.gilmore.ie">Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ireland-deputy-pm-promises-to-clarify-abortion-laws-following-death.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring "legal clarity" to the country's abortion laws. Northern Ireland's abortion law differs from those of the rest of the UK, and this lawsuit has been long-awaited by international rights groups. In October Ireland's Department of Justice <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-29538100">announced</a> [BBC report] that it would consult with the public in regards to changing the law, but the NIHRC did not believe that this effort was acted upon in a timely manner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian criminal court on Tuesday sentenced 11 individuals to death for their involvement in a 2012 soccer riot. The riots, which occurred in Port Said, killed more than 70 and injured about 1,000 others crushed by crowds attempting to leave the stadium when fans of Al-Masry violently stormed the stands and attacked Al-Ahly fans after Al-Masry won the soccer match. A total of 73 people have been <a href="http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150419/1021094312.html">accused</a> [Sputnik report] of involvement in the riots. The court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/09/world/middleeast/ap-ml-egypt-.html?_r=0">handed</a> [NYT article] 40 of the defendants charged in the matter 15-year sentences, which may be appealed.</p>

<p>In January 2013 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 21 people who were found guilty of involvement in the Port Said soccer stadium disaster to the death penalty. Protesters angry over the verdict later rioted, leading to the deaths of at least 30 people. Then-president Mohamed Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a state of emergency later that week in an attempt to quell the protests. A Cairo court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentences-for-21-involved-in-fatal-soccer-riot.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the death sentences of the 21 individuals in March 2013, and the court handed down verdicts for the remaining 52 defendants also charged in the incident. It is widely believed that police were responsible for causing the riot, during which police reportedly retreated from the crowd and cut electricity to the stadium, leaving many fans to be crushed against locked doors in the darkness. The High Court ordered a retrial for the 21 death sentences a year later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawmakers in Romania rejected a request from prosecutors to strip <a href="http://gov.ro/en/government/the-cabinet-of-ministers/prime-minister">Prime Minister Victor Ponta</a> [official profile] of immunity on Tuesday, despite him being named as a suspect last week in an anti-corruption probe. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33061619">questioned</a> [BBC report] Ponta in connection to charges of forgery, tax evasion and money laundering occurring between 2007 to 2011 and have also directed investigations toward members of his family. Members of Parliament, of which a majority belong to Ponta's Social Democratic Party, voted 231-120 in favor of blocking the prosecution. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/romanian-president-calls-pm-resign-over-corruption-probe-104312165.html">called on Ponta to resign</a> [Reuters report], but Ponta maintains that he is innocent and that his resignation would lead to a political crisis. </p>

<p>Prosecutors, led by chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Kovesi, have cracked down on the country's widespread corruption in recent years. In April a Romanian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/romania-judge-sentenced-to-10-years-for-accepting-bribes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Senior Judge Stan Mustata to 10 years and eight months in prison for granting favorable verdicts to defendants in exchange for money. In February the parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/romania-parliament-votes-to-allow-corruption-probe-of-former-presidential-candidate.php">voted to allow</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors to investigate prominent politician Elena Udrea on suspicion of corruption. That same month <a href="http://www.just.ro/">Romania's Bucharest Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Romanian] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/romania-judge-sentenced-for-accepting-bribes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Judge Mircea Moldovan to 22 years in prison for taking bribes from wealthy Romanian businessmen in exchange for ruling in their favor in court. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] released a semi-annual Cooperation and Verification Mechanism report on Romania last year, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-warns-romania-over-continued-corruption-judicial-concerns.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] the nation to end political pressure on the judiciary amid continuing concerns over corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Leaders of the four major political parties in Nepal reached an agreement Monday on key issues for a new constitution, dividing the country into eight federal states. An <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/political-agreement-pave-nepal-constitution-31626438">assembly</a> [AP report] elected in 2008 was tasked with completing the new constitution by 2010, but never completed a draft due to fighting within the nation. The boundaries for the states will be established by a federal commission and will be named by elected assemblies in each state. The new constitution is scheduled to take effect in July, at which time Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will resign from office. When officials met in January to draft the constitution, the meeting <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/nepal-lawmakers-clash-over-new-constitution.php">ended in violence</a> [JURIST report], but officials have stated that the April earthquake, which killed more than 8,700 people, drove the leaders to work together and resolve the disputed issues. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8716">welcomed the agreement</a> [press release] Tuesday, calling it "a major milestone in the country's democratic development."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Syed Mohammed Hasan Ali, a fugitive commander of Razakar Bahini, an auxiliary force of the Pakistani troops, was sentenced to death on Tuesday by a Bangladeshi court for torture and massacre committed during Bangladesh's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16207201">1971 Liberation War</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Ali was found guilty on five out of six charges and was sentenced to death by <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/web/judges.php?div_id=2">Justice M Enaytur Rahim</a> [official website], the chairman of the three-member panel of International Crimes Tribunal-1. The Tribunal was able to "prove beyond doubt" that Ali committed five out of six charged offenses, and he is the fifth person to be found guilty of war crimes <em>in absentia</em> since the trials began in 2010. Ali, who was eventually represented by a state-appointed lawyer during the trial, was believed to have fled the country when the trial process started but 26 witnesses testified against him during the trial. Under the Bangladeshi law, Ali can challenge the verdict in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court after surrendering in front of the tribunal.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/index.php">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh </a> (ICTB) [official website], which was established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 conflict, in which about 3 million people were killed. In April a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/bangladesh-appeals-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-convicted-war-criminal.php">Bangladeshi appeals court rejected</a> [JURIST report] a final appeal by Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, an Islamist party official convicted of war crimes during the 1971 Liberation war, upholding his death sentence. In February the Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/former-bangladesh-lawmaker-sentenced-to-life-for-war-crimes.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Abdul Jabbar, a militia leader and former lawmaker, to life in prison for genocide and religious persecution committed during the 1971 Liberation War. Earlier that month the <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bangladesh-islamist-leader-sentenced-to-death.php">Tribunal convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Islamist leader Adbus Subhan to death. In February the Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/former-bangladesh-official-sentenced-to-death.php">sentenced the former </a> [JURIST report] Bangladeshi Junior Minister to death for genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-50928-CV0.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] some of the strictest parts of a Texas abortion law, which could cause the majority of the state's abortion clinics to close, leaving only seven open. The decision allows the state to require abortion clinics to satisfy hospital-level operating standards, which include minimum room size and staffing levels. Unless the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court </a> [official website] agrees to stop the decision, Texas can begin to enforce the restrictions in roughly three weeks. Traditional abortion clinic owners say the millions of dollars in upgrades would cause many of them to close down. The three-judge panel noted that New Mexico abortion clinics are located just across the Texas border and the clinic owners in Texas failed to show that a "large fraction" of women would suffer as a result of the closings.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">Abortion</a> [JURIST archive] related issues have been a heated topic of discussion for the past several years in the US. Earlier this month the North Carolina legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-72-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to the Women and Children's Protection Act of 2015, which mandates a 72-hour waiting period for abortions after a woman has been informed of her options and the risks of the procedure, except in the case of a medical emergency. In May the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-idaho-abortion-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two parts of Idaho abortion laws-one which banned all abortions after 20 weeks, and the other which required that women seeking abortions in their second trimester do so in a hospital. Also in May Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/tennessee-adopts-48-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">adopted a law</a> [JURIST report] that requires 48-hour waiting periods for women seeking an abortion. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/">Wisconsin State Senate</a> [official website] on Tuesday passed the <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/proposals/sb179">Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [materials], limiting the ability of a woman to seek an abortion more than 20 weeks into her pregnancy. Proponents of the bill say it is designed to prohibit women from seeking an abortion that may cause pain to the fetus. Wisconsin Senator <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/fitzgerald/Pages/default.aspx">Scott Fitzgerald</a> [official website] voted for the bill and stated in a <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/fitzgerald/PressReleases/Pages/Wisconsin-Senate-Advances-Pain-Capable-Unborn-Child-Protection-Act.aspx">press release</a> [text], "[t]his bill is about protecting unborn children from being tortured, and should be neither partisan nor controversial." Opponents of the bill, including Wisconsin Senator <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/erpenbach/Pages/default.aspx">Jon Erpenbach</a> [official website], <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/erpenbach/PressReleases/Pages/on-the-passage-of-Senate-Bill-179-%E2%80%93-Abortion-Ban.aspx">argue</a> [press release] that it interferes with women's health rights. The bill passed the senate with a vote of 19 to 14 and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-senate-to-take-up-20-week-abortion-ban-bill/306594041/">could be voted on</a> [AP report] by the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/">Wisconsin State Assembly</a> [official website] as early as later this month. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arkansas judge on Tuesday <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/06/10/Arkansas%20gay%20marriage.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] that 500 same-sex marriages performed in the state last year be recognized as valid. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen ordered the recognition of the marriages performed during a six-day window last year after another Arkansas court <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/arkansas-judge-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">struck down</a> the state's same-sex marriage ban but before the state's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/arkansas-supreme-court-ruling-halts-issuing-of-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">put that ruling on hold</a> [JURIST reports]. Arkansas <a href="http://arkansasag.gov/">Attorney General Leslie Rutledge</a> [official website] <a href="http://arkansasag.gov/news-and-consumer-alerts/details/rutledge-comments-on-judge-griffens-ruling-to-recognize-the-marriages-of-sa">responded</a> [press release] that she does not believe the marriages fit the state's definition and that she is "evaluating the ruling and will determine the best path forward to protect the State's interest." </p>

<p>Griffen's order comes as the US Supreme Court is poised to rule on same-sex marriage by the end of this month. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] in April. Earlier this month the chief judge for the US District Court of Guam <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-guam-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the territory's same-sex marriage ban. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Greece's <a href="http://www.ministryofjustice.gr/site/el/%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%99%CE%9A%CE%97.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Greek] on Wednesday unveiled plans to introduce <a href="http://www.ministryofjustice.gr/site/el/%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%99%CE%9A%CE%97/tabid/64/itemid/2390/amid/797/.aspx">legislation</a> [materials, in Greek] giving civil union rights to <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/detail.php">same-sex</a> [JURIST backgrounder] couples. This marks the first time in the country's history that such legislation will be introduced. The bill will give rights to go along with the civil unions such as insurance, taxation, inheritance and other rights enjoyed by married Greek citizens. However, such couples will not be allowed to jointly adopt children. The bill is expected to pass without much resistance, as Greece's liberal political party, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/03/syriza-future-greece-europe-radical-left">Syriza</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], holds the majority in the parliament. A vote is expected to take place in July. </p>

<p>Same-sex couples have varied marriage rights throughout the world. In May the Parliament of Greenland <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/greenland-enacts-law-allowing-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to enact laws that will legalize same-sex marriage and allow for same-sex couples to participate in adoption. Also in May Ireland became the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/ireland-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-by-national-referendum.php">first country to legalize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage by national referendum. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> to rule on same-sex marriage, granting <em>certiorari</em> in four separate cases, and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in late April. A decision is expected by the end of June. In August Ugandan Attorney General Peter Nyomb <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal against the constitutional court ruling that struck down the nation's anti-homosexuality law. Last January the Nigerian president <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, banning same-sex marriage and criminalizing same-sex relationships.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to an unreleased report obtained by the <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> [official website], some members of a <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/">UN peacekeeping</a> [official website] mission engaged in sexual exploitation with more than 200 Haitian women, telling them that they had to in order to obtain necessary food and medication. Many see this as a sign that sexual exploitation consistently goes unreported during such missions. The draft of the report, authored by the <a href="https://oios.un.org/">Office of Internal Oversight Services</a> (OIOS) [official website] and expected to be released next month, examines how these UN peacekeeping missions deal with the constant problem of sexual exploitation. The report states, among other findings, that about a third of alleged abuse involves minors under the age of 18, assistance to victims is severely deficient, and there is a widespread confusion of the difference between consent and exploitation. Investigators from the OIOS interviewed more than 230 Haitian women last year who stated that they had engaged in "transactional sex" with UN peacekeepers for necessary items or services. "In cases of non-payment, some women withheld the badges of peacekeepers and threatened to reveal their infidelity via social media," the report <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_UNITED_NATIONS_PEACEKEEPERS_SEXUAL_EXPLOITATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">says</a> [AP report]. "Only seven interviewees knew about the United Nations policy prohibiting sexual exploitation and abuse."</p>

<p>Sexual exploitation continues to be a major problem throughout the world. An <a href="/forum/2015/03/tseliso-thipanyane-trafficking-africa.php">investigation</a> [JURIST commentary] by the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] found that about $99 billion in illicit profits can be attributed to sexual exploitation around the world, affecting approximately 4.5 million victims. Earlier this month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-sg-sets-up-independent-review-of-car-sex-abuse-allegations.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that in light of allegations of sexual abuse in the Central African Republic (CAR) by foreign troops not under UN control, an External Independent Review will be set up to examine the UN's handling of such allegations. In May the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-of-car-peacekeepers.php">called on several states to investigate allegations</a> [JURIST report] that members of their peacekeeping forces sent to the CAR have committed serious human rights violations, including sexual exploitation of women and children. The problem extends to the US as well. In June 2010 the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-state-department-issues-annual-report-on-human-trafficking.php">released its annual report on human trafficking</a> [JURIST report], concluding that the US has a "serious problem with human trafficking, both for labor and commercial sexual exploitation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="https://aclufl.org/">ACLU of Florida</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/FL-Delay-Emergency-Motion-For-Temporary-Relief.pdf">lawsuit</a> [motion, PDF] Thursday challenging a <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2015/0633">Florida law</a> [HB 633 materials] requiring women to visit a doctor and wait 24 hours before undergoing an abortion. Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="http://www.flgov.com/2015/06/10/governor-rick-scott-signs-55-bills-into-law/">signed the bill into law</a> [press release] Wednesday, and it is scheduled to take effect July 1. The lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Leon County on behalf of Bread and Roses Women's Health Center and Medical Students for Choice. The plaintiffs are seeking an emergency injunction to block the law's implementation:<blockquote>By subjecting all women seeking abortion care to both a mandatory twenty-four hour delay and an additional-trip requirement&#8212;a burden placed on patients seeking no other medical procedure in Florida, much less a medical procedure protected by the state Constitution as a fundamental right&#8212;the Act can only serve to deter women from seeking abortions, and to punish and discriminate against those who do. By impeding a woman's access to abortion, the Act violates her right to privacy as guaranteed under article I, section 23 of the Florida Constitution. Because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and they, along with their patients and all Florida women seeking abortions, will suffer irreparable harm if the Act is not enjoined, and because an injunction will serve the public interest, this Court should issue immediate temporary injunctive relief against enforcement of the Act.</blockquote>The legislation includes exceptions for women who can produce a police report or hospital record demonstrating that the pregnancy was a result of rape, incest, domestic violence or human trafficking.</p>

<p><a href="/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Earlier this week the Wisconsin Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/wisconsin-senate-passes-law-limiting-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, limiting the ability of a woman to seek an abortion more than 20 weeks into her pregnancy. Also this week the  <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-controversial-parts-of-texas-abortion-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] some of the strictest parts of a Texas abortion law, which could cause the majority of the state's abortion clinics to close, leaving only seven open. Earlier this month the North Carolina legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-72-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to the Women and Children's Protection Act of 2015, which mandates a 72-hour waiting period for abortions after a woman has been informed of her options and the risks of the procedure, except in the case of a medical emergency. In May the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-idaho-abortion-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two parts of Idaho abortion laws&#8212;one which banned all abortions after 20 weeks, and the other which required that women seeking abortions in their second trimester do so in a hospital. Also in May Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/tennessee-adopts-48-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">adopted a law</a> [JURIST report] that requires 48-hour waiting periods for women seeking an abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/15403/index.do">ruled</a> [judgment] Thursday that a law restricting the medical use of marijuana to smoking the dried plant was unconstitutional. Under the <a href="https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> [text], smoking marijuana for medical purposes was permitted, but uses of the plant's extracts in other forms such as in topical applications or food were not. The court held that using alternative forms of marijuana may be "medically reasonable" and that limiting use to smoking would pose an arbitrary risk to users. For both reasons, the court found the restriction to violate <a href="https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7">Section 7</a> [text] of the country's constitution.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes has created controversy in both the US and Canada. Earlier this month, the Louisiana House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/louisiana-legislature-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a medical marijuana bill. In May the Pennsylvania Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a similar medical marijuana bill that would allow medical marijuana products to be grown by licensed cultivation facilities and distributed through state-regulated dispensaries. Also in May Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/puerto-rico-governor-signs-executive-order-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order legalizing medical marijuana. In 2013, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld</a> Canada's general ban on marijuana, reversing a lower court decision that held the nation's marijuana laws were <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ontario-court-finds-canada-medical-marijuana-laws-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/BY/Pages/SRBelarus.aspx">Miklós Haraszti</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16067&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] that Belarus continues to sentence and imprison political opponents of the government. Haraszti cited examples from April and May where existing prisoners we given extended sentences or placed under worse conditions and called for their release<blockquote>This year, the authorities chose in several cases to extend prison sentences of already incarcerated political opponents or impose harsher prison conditions, on differently formulated but similar grounds...</p>

<p>I urge the Belarus authorities not only to release, but also to fully rehabilitate political opponents who have been imprisoned.</blockquote>Haraszti said the situation was particularly concerning given the country's upcoming October presidential elections.</p>

<p>Haraszti was appointed Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus in 2012 and has been critical of the country's judicial and penal systems. In March 2014 he called for the country to <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-calls-for-moratorium-on-belarus-capital-punishment.php">end its use</a> of the death penalty, <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/belarus-must-stop-executing-its-citizens-un.php#.U1vQaPldXT8">reiterating</a> [JURIST reports] earlier statements and citing politically motivated courts and the lack of fair trials. In 2011 former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay suggested a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention</a> [JURIST report] in Belarus and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Although Belarus is an active member of the UN and has ratified many of its human rights policies, Pillay noted a sharp deterioration in human rights since the 2010 disputed re-election of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile], who has been in power since 1994. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/House/House.html">North Carolina House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Thursday passed a law that would allow some court officials to refuse to perform <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/detail.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST backgrounder] based on their religious beliefs, overriding a <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-religious-objection-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Pat McCroy</a> [official website]. The law requires that officials who hold such religious beliefs must stop performing all marriages for a period of six months. The vote of 69-41 was just over the three-fifths majority needed to override the veto. Ten members of the House were absent and did not vote. The Senate had also overridden the veto with a vote of 32-16.</p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, as well as freedom of religious practice, remain controversial issues in the US. Nineteen states have enacted some variety of religious freedom laws, most modeled after the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993. In Louisiana the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/louisiana-governor-issues-executive-order-after-religious-objections-bill-defeated.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a religious objections bill last month that was pushed by Governor Bobby Jindal. In April Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed into law an amended version of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which critics argued gave business owners the legal right to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indiana-arkansas-governors-sign-amended-religious-freedom-bills.php">deny</a> [JURIST report] service based on sexual orientation. Pence signed Indiana's original controversial version into law after the state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/indiana-lawmakers-approve-religious-freedom-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill by a 40-10 vote. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.const-court.be/en/common/home.html">Constitutional Court of Belgium</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.const-court.be/public/f/2015/2015-084f.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF, in French] that a law requiring Internet service providers and telecommunications operators to retain customer metadata for possible future police investigations violates fundamental privacy rights and is therefore unconstitutional. Specifically the law required these organizations to <a href="http://www.cio.co.nz/article/577249/belgian-data-retention-law-axed-by-constitutional-court/">store customer metadata</a> [IDG report] such as phone call logs and Internet data for one year so that law enforcement could use the data for investigating serious crimes and terrorism. The law was enacted in 2013 as part of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/data-retention/index_en.htm">EU Data Retention Directive</a> [official website], which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/european-court-of-justice-rules-data-collection-too-invasive.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] last year. The lawsuit was brought by the <a href="http://llp.cz/en/">League of Human Rights</a> [official website] and the Order of French-speaking and German-speaking Lawyers nearly immediately after the law was introduced. </p>

<p>Government surveillance policies around the world have been hotly debated recently. Earlier this month the US Senate approved the USA Freedom Act, which <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-senate-votes-to-reduce-governments-mass-surveillance-powers.php">reduces the federal government's surveillance</a> [JURIST report] of Americans' phone records. In March a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dutch-court-holds-data-retention-law-violates-privacy.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] its data retention law, holding that it violates privacy rights of EU citizens. Also in March France's government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">pushed a surveillance bill</a> [JURIST report] that would give French intelligence services the authority to monitor metadata.  Such focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China's ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang was found guilty Thursday of bribery, abuse of power and intentionally disclosing national secrets was sentenced to life imprisonment. He has also been deprived of his political rights for life and has had his personal assets confiscated. A year after Zhou's retirement in 2012, he was put under investigation as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. Zhou's <a href="http://english.cntv.cn/2015/06/11/ARTI1434017711695496.shtml">trial was largely kept secret</a> [Xinhua report]. Some speculate that this was because he was not cooperating with prosecutors, while others thought that the Chinese government was embarrassed by Zhou's crimes. Zhou was found to have, among other things, accepted bribes of about 130 million yuan (USD $21.3 million), leaked five highly confidential documents and taken large bribes in return for information about China's Communist party. Other senior officials convicted of serious crimes within China have typically been sentenced to death. However, due to Zhou's cooperation in returning all gifts and cash, and the fact that his disclosure of state secrets did not have very serious consequences, Zhou was given a lesser punishment.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform its judicial system and combat corruption. In March officials announced that efforts against corruption have led to the <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/china-implicates-14-generals-in-anti-corruption-campaign.php">investigation and conviction of 14 generals</a> [JURIST report] for corrupt financial practices. In February Chinese officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-to-prosecute-top-parliamentary-official-for-graft.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the impending prosecution of Su Rong, former vice chairman of China's top parliamentary advisory board, for graft. In July China's former Communist Party leader Bo Xilai was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-communist-party-leader-formally-charged-with-corruption.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] with corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power. In March 2012 the President and Chief Justice of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) told the National People's Congress (NPC) that the country must <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-chief-judge-urges-courts-to-continue-legal-reforms.php">continue to implement legal reform</a> [JURIST report] to combat corruption and foster social and economic growth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Assistant Secretary-General for UN peacekeeping operations <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2010/sga1228.doc.htm">Edmund Mulet</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11924.doc.htm">said</a> [press release] Tuesday that the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan is continuing to harm civilians. Presenting the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/378">Report of the Secretary-General on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], Mulet said an increase in violent attacks "by armed assailants against United Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel" has made protecting and aiding civilians incredibly difficult. The report notes that at least 70,000 people have been displaced this year with additional reports of as many as 130,000 being displaced. Aggravating factors in the region are listed as inter-communal fighting, conflicts over resources, broader political tensions, the actions of numerous paramilitary groups and militias, the proliferation of small arms and criminality, and the handling of insecurity by local authorities. </p>

<p>There has been significant international attention surrounding the human rights violations in Sudan. Last June <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Ali Kosheib, former militia leader turned officer of the Sudan Central Reserve Police, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-suspect-seen-at-new-sudan-crime-scenes-hrw.php">spotted in an attack</a> [JURIST report] against Salamat communities in Central Darfur. In January 2014 HRW urged Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">end its crackdown</a> [JURIST report] against political and cultural groups. In July 2013 <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that attacks on UN peacekeepers in Darfur <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-prosecutor-darfur-attacks-may-constitute-war-crimes.php">may constitute war crimes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] said Thursday that they have <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5166_en.htm">opened a formal antitrust investigation</a> [press release] into Amazon's e-books business. The investigation will focus on particular clauses in Amazon's contracts requiring publishers to inform Amazon about more favorable or alternative terms offered to Amazon's competitors. Amazon has also added clauses to their contracts that require publishers to offer terms at least as good, if not better than, their competitors' contracts. The Commission is concerned that these clauses may cause more difficulties for other e-book distributors who are trying to compete with Amazon. EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said:<blockquote>Amazon has developed a successful business that offers consumers a comprehensive service, including for e-books. Our investigation does not call that into question. However, it is my duty to make sure that Amazon's arrangements with publishers are not harmful to consumers, by preventing other e-book distributors from innovating and competing effectively with Amazon. Our investigation will show if such concerns are justified.</blockquote>If the Commission determines that Amazon has violated EU antitrust rules, then Amazon may face charges or may be forced to change their business practices. </p>

<p>The world's largest technology companies have faced antitrust charges in the US and internationally in recent months. In May the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/eu-officials-open-antitrust-investigation-regarding-online-shopping.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into potential antitrust violations in the e-commerce market with the scope of the investigation including a number of the world's largest technology and search companies. In April the European Commission initiated antitrust <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/eu-initiates-antitrust-proceedings-against-google.php">proceedings against Google</a> [JURIST report] accusing the company of utilizing its dominant position in the search engine market to hurt competitors. In February a judge for the Northern District of California dismissed a class action <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-google-antitrust-suit.php">suit against Google</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly monopolizing search engines in Android phones. In September a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-judge-approves-settlement-in-ebay-antitrust-case.php">approved a settlement between federal antitrust authorities and eBay</a> [JURIST report] over allegations that eBay agreed to not to selectively recruit and hire employees from rival companies. In June Apple <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/apple-settles-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">reached an out-of-court settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice regarding a class action lawsuit that accused the electronics company of illegally participating in a e-book price-fixing scheme.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16068&LangID=E">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> and a <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150610_05_en.htm">spokesperson for the EU</a> [press releases] on Thursday demanded that the government of Pakistan reinstate its death penalty moratorium. The EU also called on the Pakistani government to uphold their obligations under international law, which condemns the use of torture and prohibits state executions of juveniles. Since Pakistan lifted the ban in December 2014 <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1187562/eu-expresses-concern-over-increasing-death-executions-in-pakistan">more than 150 people have been executed</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] by the state. Officials are particularly concerned about death sentences carried out against juveniles. Aftab Bahadur was hanged this month even though it was alleged that he was a juvenile when the crime was committed and when he was convicted. It is also alleged that he had been tortured in prison to extract a confession. The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed a petition this month by another death row inmate amidst allegations that the inmate was convicted as a juvenile. Human rights activists estimate that there are currently <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">8,000 inmates on death row</a> [JURIST report]. </p>

<p>The Pakistani government's lifting of the death penalty moratorium is one step in a series of anti-terrorism efforts in recent years. The moratorium was lifted in the wake of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-savage-extremism-of-taliban-insurgents.php">school massacre</a> [JURIST report] by the Pakistani Taliban in December 2014 in Peshawar, which killed 134 children along with 16 staff members. In January Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/pakistan-president-signs-new-law-allowing-military-courts-to-prosecute-terror-suspects.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] anti-terrorism legislation that established military courts for the hearing of civilian terrorism related cases. The president's signature came just one day after the Pakistan National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/pakistan-lawmakers-allow-military-courts-to-prosecute-terrorism-cases.php">passed the law unopposed</a> [JURIST report], securing the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. Last July Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/pakistan-passes-strict-anti-terrorism-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a strict anti-terrorism bill that allowed police to use lethal force, to search buildings without a warrant and to detain suspects at secret facilities for up to 60 days without charge "on reasonable apprehension of commission of a scheduled offense."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Humans Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], along with Amnesty International, Civil Society Organizations Reference Group and National Civil Society Congress called on authorities in Kenya on Thursday to stop the harassment and intimidation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the country's coastal region. The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/10/kenya-end-harassment-rights-groups">groups said in a statement</a> (HRW report) that the harassment and intimidation of Haki Africa and <a href="http://www.muhuri.org/">Muslims for Human Rights</a> (MUHURI) [advocacy website] is connected to their legitimate human rights work. Kenyan authorities placed both Haki Africa and MUHURI on an official list of alleged supporters of terrorism. Kenyan officials proceeded to freeze the bank accounts of both organizations without first notifying the groups. Haki Africa and MUHURI were since <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/kenyan-rights-groups-celebrate-lifting-terrorist-tag-143242198.html">removed from the list</a> [AFP report] by court order. Both groups are engaged in human rights protection in Kenya's coastal region by documenting human rights abuses in the area. The region has a large Muslim population and often faces attacks from armed groups, including Somalia's al-Shabaab. The groups allege that Kenyan security forces have responded by detaining and abusing local residents, often forcibly disappearing or killing suspects. </p>

<p>Kenya's Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) has carried out a <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/rights-group-alleges-abuses-by-kenya-anti-terror-police-group.php">series of extrajudicial killings </a>[JURIST report] and enforced disappearances in violation of international human rights laws, according to HRW in August. The ATPU has previously come under criticism by other human rights groups. Last year the Kenyan human rights group MUHURI and the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/open-society-justice-initiative">Open Society Justice Initiative </a>[advocacy website] issued a report calling on the US and the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/kenyan-rights-group-accuses-national-anti-terrorism-police-of-unlawful-activity.php">suspend financial support</a> [JURIST report] to the ATPU. The report's publishing followed the completion of a new ATPU headquarters in Nairobi in May, which was partially funded by international anti-terror agencies. The facility increased technological capabilities and physical space for the ATPU, whose mission is to coordinate and carry out anti-terrorism operations within Kenya in support of the international <a href="/feature/2013/07/the-war-on-terror.php">War on Terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The unit's primary focus of late is Kenya's second-largest city, Mombasa, because the port city has become a major recruitment target for the al-Qaida linked Islamist group <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15336689">al-Shabaab</a> [BBC Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+shabaab">news archive</a>], based in Somalia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michigan governor <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/">Rick Snyder</a> [official website] on Thursday signed into law a <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(izykc2qn104vlhvs5usoplcj))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2015-HB-4188">bill</a> [materials] that allows private adoption agencies to deny placements they object to for religious reasons, including placements with same-sex couples. Snyder said the law <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277--356932--,00.html">reflects existing practices</a> [press release] by the state and that his objective is to get as many children adopted as possible. <a href="http://www.micatholic.org/">Michigan Catholic Conference</a> [advocacy website] CEO Paul Long <a href="http://www.micatholic.org/advocacy/news-room/news-releases/2015/governor-synder-signs-faith-based-child-placement-bills/">advocated for the bill</a> [press release], saying it would "promote a diverse range of child placement providers." <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">ACLU of Michigan</a> [advocacy website] deputy director Rana Elmir <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/issues/adoption/2015-06/2175">condemned the bill</a> [press release], saying "Agencies have a legal obligation to ensure the best interests of the child are considered during placement. There is nothing about this shameful legislation that helps vulnerable kids find homes," and promising to appeal the law.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and adoption remain controversial issues around the world. In May the Supreme Court of the US Virgin Islands <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/virgin-islands-top-court-permits-second-parent-adoptions-by-same-sex-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that second-parent adoptions by same-sex couples are permitted under Virgin Islands law. In April the Florida Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/florida-senate-votes-to-repeal-ban-on-same-sex-adoption.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the state's ban on same-sex adoption. In March the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals ruled that the state <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/alabama-court-recognizes-same-sex-adoption.php">must recognize</a> the out-of-state adoption of a biological mother's same-sex partner. Also In March, the <a href="http://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/en/Home">Slovenian Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/slovenia-approves-same-sex-marriage-adoption-legislation.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] granting same-sex marriage and adoption rights amid public opposition from conservative and religious groups. In February the <a href="http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/">Constitutional Court of Colombia</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/Colombia-court-upholds-restrictions-on-adoption-for-same-sex-couples.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that same-sex couples cannot adopt children that have no biological relation to either parent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3EBDD9BA6454E1FB85257E620054E9E0/$file/11-1324-1557116.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] the conspiracy conviction of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/12/02/ali-hamza-ahmad-suliman-al-bahlul">Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul</a> [HRW profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahlul">news archive</a>], the media secretary for <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive], in a 2-1 decision. The court <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article23854558.html">ruled</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] that conspiracy was not a war crime for which Bahlul could be tried by a military commission. The appeals court found that Congress does not possess the constitutional authority to add conspiracy to the internationally recognized war crimes list that may be tried by military commission. In reacting to the decision, experts have stated that only the trial for the September 11 attacks will pass basic tests of constitutionality. Guantanamo Bay defense lawyer Commander Brian Mizer <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11672186/US-Appeals-Courts-delivers-fresh-blow-to-Guantanamo-Bay-war-crimes-courts.html">said</a> [<em>Telegraph </em>report] that it meant that the DC Circuit court was telling the US that it "is obliged to comply with international law as a matter of [its] own constitution and the rule of international law," no longer allowing the country to ignore international law in how it detains and interrogates people. It is not yet clear whether the government will appeal to the US Supreme Court. </p>

<p>The DC Circuit in July <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/federal-appeals-court-overturns-two-convictions-of-former-al-qaeda-media-director.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Bahlul's convictions for providing material support for terrorism and solicitation of others to commit war crimes. It did not overturn his conviction for conspiracy to commit terrorism, remanding that issue to the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/">Court of Military Commission Review</a> (CMCR) [official website]. A three-judge panel of the appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the prior year that the military tribunal that convicted Bahlul in 2007 erred because a Guantanamo prisoner could not be convicted of conspiracy unless his crime took place after 2006. The CMCR <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/military-court-upholds-sentence-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled</a> in 2011 that Bahlul had been properly convicted of being a propagandist and should <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-sentences-yemeni.php">spend the rest of his life in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. Bahlul, a Yemeni citizen, went on trial at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2008. He was accused of researching the financial impact of the 9/11 attacks and also releasing the "martyr wills" of 9/11 hijackers Muhammed Atta and Ziad al Jarrah as propaganda videos. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US District Court judge on Friday approved an agreement between the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and the city of Cleveland that is intended to reform the city's police department. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/doj-reaches-settlement-with-cleveland-over-police-use-of-excessive-force.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report], a consent decree reached after five months of negotiation between attorneys for both sides, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/federal-judge-approves-cleveland-police-reform-agreement-31721603">imposes</a> [AP report] "a special obligation on [them] to the public," according to Judge Solomon Oliver Jr., who called on both city offices and citizens to embrace the agreement. Efforts to create the consent decree began following a December <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2014/12/04/cleveland_division_of_police_findings_letter.pdf">DOJ report</a> [text, PDF], which found that a pattern and practice of police officers in Cleveland using excessive force and violating civil rights existed, detailing incidents of force used on citizens. Under the newly signed agreement, the city and DOJ must hire an independent monitoring team in the next 90 days that will oversee how the different elements of it are put in place. The cost of implementation is expected to be between $900,000 to more than $2 million annually. The agreement includes a requirement that officers receive more training on bias-free policing as well as use of force. </p>

<p>Police use of force has been a controversial issue across the US recently. In May US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-attorney-general-announces-investigation-into-baltimore-police.php">launched a federal civil rights investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Baltimore's police following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. Earlier this year Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">shot and killed Micheal Brown</a> [USA Today Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">Amnesty International reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Six Guantanamo detainees were <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=17339">transferred</a> [press release] to Oman Saturday, marking the first transfer of detainees from the prison in five months.The Pentagon reports that the six Yemeni men transferred include Emad Abdullah Hassan, held without charge since 2002, Idris Ahmad 'Abd Al Qadir Idris and Jalal Salam Awad Awad, all accused of being one of many bodyguards to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, as well as Sharaf Ahmad Muhammad Mas'ud, whom the US said fought American soldiers at Tora Bora, Afghanistan, before his capture in Pakistan, Saa'd Nasser Moqbil Al Azani, a religious teacher whom the US believes had ties to bin Laden's religious adviser, and Muhammad Ali Salem Al Zarnuki, who allegedly arrived in Afghanistan as early as 1998 to fight and support the Taliban. President Barack Obama's administration has transferred more than half of the 242 detainees held at the prison as part of his campaign to close the facility, but lawmakers have suggested new restrictions on transfers that may lead to further challenges to the president's initiative.</p>

<p>The acceleration of the closure of <a href="/feature/2014/08/guantanamo-bay-history.php">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/obama-to-expedite-closing-of-guantanamo-bay-prison.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration in December is a part of the administration's attempt to fulfill campaign promises made by Obama in 2008. The <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/four-afghans-transferred-from-guantanamo.php">announced the repatriation</a> [JURIST report] of four Guantanamo Bay detainees to Afghanistan in December. In November five detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/dod-announces-transfer-of-5-guantanamo-detainees.php">released</a> [JURIST report] to their respective home countries of Georgia and Slovakia. Also in November the Pentagon <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/guantanamo-inmate-of-13-years-released-to-kuwait.php">announced the release</a> [JURIST report] of Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda from the detention facilities after nearly 13 years of imprisonment without a trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mexico's <a href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] has declared it unconstitutional for Mexican states to ban same-sex marriages. The court's June 3 ruling, made public this week, is <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/world/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide-1.10538046">considered a "jurisprudential thesis"</a> [AP report] and does not invalidate any state laws making it necessary for same-sex couples to seek individual redress from the courts. However, based on this ruling, all judges and courts would have to <a href="http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion-mexico/2015/limitar-las-bodas-gay-contra-la-constitucion-1107029.html">approve same-sex marriages</a> [<em>El Universal</em> report, in Spanish] in the country. Same-sex marriage is legal in some parts of Mexico including Mexico City and the northern state of Coahuila. </p>

<p>Same-sex couples have varied marriage rights throughout the world. In May Ireland became the first country to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/ireland-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-by-national-referendum.php">legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] by national referendum. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to rule on same-sex marriage, granting <em>certiorari</em> in four separate cases, and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in late April. A decision is expected by the end of June. In August Ugandan Attorney General Peter Nyomb <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/uganda-ag-appeals-decision-against-anti-gay-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal against the constitutional court ruling that struck down the nation's anti-homosexuality law. Last January the Nigerian president signed [JURIST report] the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, banning same-sex marriage and criminalizing same-sex relationships. Similar laws exist in <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">Singapore</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-condemns-lgbt-discrimination-in-jamaica.php">Jamaica</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poland official: US hindering investigation into secret CIA prison</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US is hindering Poland's investigation into a secret <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">CIA</a> [official website] prison there, a Polish prosecutor said Saturday. Piotr Kosmaty, spokesman for the Appeals Prosecutor's Office in Krakow that is doing the investigation, said that the US has ignored requests for documents relevant to the investigation. The Polish investigators were interested in a report by the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official website] summarizing CIA prison locations and practices. In particular there were facts in the report that suggested a secret CIA prison existed in Poland from 2002-2003 where terrorist suspects were treated very harshly. Kosmaty said that the Poland has asked the US for the full non-redacted version of the report but have received no response. Previous requests for other documents and opportunities to question the alleged victims, who are currently being held in <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/detail.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder], were also ignored. The US claims that releasing such documents would be against national interest. In addition to the Polish prison, there have been reports of other CIA "black sites" in other parts of Poland, Romania and Lithuania. </p>

<p>Poland has been accused of hosting a CIA-operated secret prison, where terrorism suspects were held and tortured between 2002 and 2005. An <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/guantanamo-detainee-asks-poland-to-probe-alleged-cia-secret-prison.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the prison has been ongoing in Poland since 2008. The US has acknowledged its program of "extraordinary rendition," which includes detention facilities around the world, to detain and question suspected al Qaeda militants. Amnesty International's report, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/fr/library/asset/EUR37/002/2013/en/4c2d64c3-efbd-40db-aca6-7d5568efcd80/eur370022013en.pdf">Unlock the truth: Poland's involvement in CIA secret detention</a> [report, PDF], outlines the search for accountability in Poland. The Polish investigation of the CIA "black site" has been conducted largely under cover of secrecy since it opened in 2008, whereby prosecutors have declined to disclose information related to the investigation or make its findings public. In November 2013 Poland formally requested that the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/poland-asks-european-court-to-hold-hearing-over-secret-cia-prison-in-private.php">hold a hearing</a> [JURIST report] regarding Poland's complicity in the CIA secret detention facilities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for South Africa's high court on Sunday issued an order barring Sudanese President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16010445">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile], who has an international warrant out for his arrest, from leaving the country. Bashir, who was visiting South Africa for an <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website] summit, is currently wanted by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for human rights violations including genocide committed during the <a href="http://www.trust.org/spotlight/Darfur-conflict">conflict in Darfur</a> [Reuters backgrounder]. Bashir will unlikely be arrested however, as South Africa's government has granted legal immunity to all African Union delegates. Reaction to the order has been mixed. The <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/index.php">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [official website] claimed that the ICC is selectively imposing justice by singling out Africans. Other organizations, such as the human rights group <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/">Southern African Litigation Centre</a> [official website], had earlier petitioned the ICC to force the government to issue an arrest warrant for Bashir. </p>

<p>The ICC has been struggling to investigate the situation in Darfur for years and has made little progress since 2009. In March the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-seeking-un-help-in-bashir-genocide-prosecution.php">requested assistance</a> [JURIST report] from the UN Security Council (UNSC) in the forced extradition of Bashir. In asking the UNSC to take "necessary measures" to force Sudan to comply with the ICC investigation, the court noted that without such assistance, the Council's decision to request investigation into al-Bashir in 2005 would "never achieve its ultimate goal." In February African leaders <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop cases Bashir and Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto or suspend the charges until African concerns are considered by the court. In December Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the UNSC that her office was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/icc-prosecutor-halts-darfur-investigation.php">dropping its investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the situation in Darfur. Knowing that the ICC lacks a policing force, Bashir responded that "they wanted us to kneel before the international criminal court but the ICC raised its hands and admitted that it had failed" and further stated that the Sudanese people had defeated the ICC. In June Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/icc-prosecutor-urges-un-action-in-darfur.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UNSC to take action to end the conflict in the Darfur region. Last March more than 30 human rights and civil society organizations <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/rights-groups-call-for-arrest-of-sudan-president.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for Bashir's arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An international group of high-ranking military officials and diplomats has found that Israel met or exceeded international standards during its 2014 conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to a <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/HLIMG-report-cover-letter-to-Judge-Mary-McGowan-Davis-UNHRC-31-May-2015.pdf">report</a> [PDF] from the group published by <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/">UN Watch</a> [advocacy website] on Friday. The High Level International Military Group traveled to Israel in May and met with a wide range of Israeli military personnel. The group said that while some mistakes were made, they found significant evidence that Israel sought to avoid the conflict, used care in choosing targets, warned civilians before strikes, and held those who acted inappropriately accountable<blockquote>Our overall findings are that during Operation Protective Edge last summer, in the air, on the ground and at sea, Israel not only met a reasonable international standard of observance of the laws of armed conflict, but in many cases significantly exceeded that standard. We saw clear evidence of this from the upper to the lower levels of command. A measure of the seriousness with which Israel took its moral duties and its responsibilities under the laws of armed conflict is that in some cases Israel's scrupulous adherence to the laws of war cost Israeli soldiers' and civilians' lives.</blockquote>The group sent its report to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/CommissionOfInquiry.aspx">UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict</a> [official materials], which is expected to present its findings to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHCR) [official website] on June 29.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/israel-palestine">Israel-Palestine conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] is an ongoing concern for human rights groups, and many have criticized both Israel and Hamas for their actions. In April, a UN board of inquiry said that it <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-israel-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-in-gaza.php">uncovered evidence</a> [JURIST report] that at least 44 Palestinians have been killed by "Israeli actions" while sheltering at UN locations. In March the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-annual-humanitarian-overview-for-the-situation-in-palestine-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its 2014 Annual Humanitarian Overview, noting that Palestinian civilians continue to face daily threats to their physical safety and liberty. Also in March the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights told UNHCR that human rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-condemns-violations-in-gaza-conflic.php">violations "fuel and shape the conflict"</a> [JURIST report] in the occupied Palestinian territories. In November 2014 UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-body-urges-israel-to-investigate-alleged-war-crimes.php">urged Israel to investigate</a> [JURIST report] alleged violations committed by its forces during the recent conflict in Gaza. In September 2014 <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] accused the Israeli military of <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes-in-gaza.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report] by attacking schools where hundreds of displaced Palestinians sought shelter. Earlier that month the <a href="http://israellawcenter.org/">Israel Law Center</a> [advocacy website] asked the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-asked-to-open-war-crimes-investigation-of-hamas-leader.php">open an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged war crimes committed by Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lynch</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a federal appeals court has jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) rejection of an alien's motion to reopen his or her case. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5th-Cir-Mata.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that it had no jurisdiction to review petitioner's request that the BIA equitably toll the 90-day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1003.2">8 CFR § 1003.2(c)(2)</a> [text]. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court reversed:<blockquote>An alien ordered to leave the country has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen his removal proceedings. ... If immigration officials deny that motion, a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider a petition to review their decision. ... Notwithstanding that rule, the court below declined to take jurisdiction over such an appeal because the motion to reopen had been denied as untimely. We hold that was error.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-oklahoma-lethal-injection-procedure.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in April after <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in January. Petitioner Noel Reyes Mata is a Mexican citizen who entered the US unlawfully and was later convicted of assault. He was ordered removed, but his attorney failed to file a timely appeal. Mata argued that his case should be reopened beyond the 90 day time limit because of his attorney's failure to perform his duties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Din</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the government's denial of a man's visa application did not violate his wife's constitutional rights. Respondent Fauzia Din, an American citizen from Afghanistan, had sued the US government after her husband, Afghan citizen Kanishka Berashk, was denied a visa in 2009. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1632008.html">allowed the challenge</a> [opinion]. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court vacated that decision:<blockquote>The state action of which Din complains is the denial of Berashk's visa application. Naturally, one would expect him&#8212;not Din&#8212;to bring this suit. But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission. ... So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Government's denial of her <em>husband's</em> visa application violated <em>her</em> constitutional rights. ... In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right.</blockquote>Justice Anthony Kennedy filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in October and <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-visa-denials-prisoners-access-to-courts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in February. The State Department said that the reason for the denial was based on Berashk's involvement in "terrorist activities," but did not specify any further what that entailed.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-103_bpdg.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-3 on Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/baker-botts-l-l-p-v-asarco-l-l-c/">Baker Botts v. ASARCO</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that law firms representing those undergoing bankruptcy proceedings cannot recoup fees incurred when defending the fees they originally charged their client. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/330">Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules</a> [11 USC §330(a)(1) text], lawyers and others providing services to bankruptcy debtors can receive fees for "actual, necessary services rendered." Baker Botts had represented ASARCO in bankruptcy proceedings starting in 2005 and was awarded $113M for the representation. It also sought, and was originally awarded, $5.1M for fees incurred while defending the original fees after ASARCO challenged them. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas held that defending these fees was not a service rendered to the debtor and was therefore not covered under the section<blockquote>As we long ago observed, "The general practice of the United States is in opposition" to forcing one side to pay the other's attorney's fees, and "even if that practice [is] not strictly correct in principle, it is entitled to the respect of the court, till it is changed, or modified, by statute." ... (emphasis deleted). We follow that approach today. Because §330(a)(1) does not explicitly override the American Rule with respect to fee-defense litigation, it does not permit bankruptcy courts to award compensation for such litigation.</blockquote>The ruling upheld an earlier opinion issued by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the dissent, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case last October and <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-religious-accommodation-attorney-compensation.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061515zor_32q3.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1172.htm">Walker-McGill v. Stuart</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/walker-mcgill-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], letting stand a decision blocking North Carolina's abortion ultrasound requirement. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in December <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/north-carolina-abortion-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision that the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H854v1.pdf">Woman's Right to Know Act</a> [text, PDF], which required physicians to display and describe ultrasound images to women seeking abortions, is an unconstitutional violation of the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text]. The state, which passed the law over a veto by then-governor Beverly Perdue, appealed to the US Supreme Court. The court declined to hear the appeal Monday, meaning the law will not be enforced. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented without comment.</p>

<p>Monday's denial comes in the wake of a decision by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-controversial-parts-of-texas-abortion-law.php">upholding</a> [JURIST report] some of the strictest parts of a Texas abortion law, which could cause the majority of the state's abortion clinics to close, leaving only seven open. The decision allows the state to require abortion clinics to satisfy hospital-level operating standards, which include minimum room size and staffing levels. Unless the Supreme Court blocks the decision, Texas could begin to enforce the restrictions in roughly two weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061515zor_32q3.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-1496.htm">Dollar General v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dollar-General-Petition-final.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] on whether tribal courts can hear civil cases involving non-Indian businesses that have contractual agreements with the tribe. The case involves a sexual harassment claim brought in a tribal court by an Indian intern against the manager of a Dollar General store leasing property from and taking part in an internship program paid for by the tribe. While Indian courts do not generally have jurisdiction over non-Indian persons or corporations, at issue is language from an <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html">earlier case</a> [<em>Montana v. United States</em> text] that a "tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members." The case is an appeal from the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], which had denied a rehearing <em>en banc</em>.</p>

<p>Also granted <em>certiorari</em> Monday was <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-844.htm">Bruce v. Samuels</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A.Bruce-Petition-for-Cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] on the percentage of a prisoner's income that may be used to pay court fees when they were not able to pay the fees initially. If a prisoner is appealing a single case, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1915">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a> [28 USC § 1915 text] caps the repayment rate at 20 percent of their monthly income. But this case involves prisoners who are appealing multiple cases, and the question is whether the law limits the percentage to 20 percent for each case or for all a prisoner's cases combined. Circuit courts have split on the issue, with the DC, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits holding that the cap is 20 percent for each case and the Second and Fourth Circuits holding that the cap is 20 percent combined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is facing its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/06/world-leaders-neglect-of-refugees-condemns-millions-to-death-and-despair/">worst refugee crisis since World War II</a> [press release], <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said Monday, calling on world leaders to reform domestic and international policies. AI released a new <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/POL4017962015ENGLISH.PDF">briefing</a> [text, PDF] Monday ahead of World Refugee Day on June 20. The report cites Syria as the world's largest refugee crisis but also calls attention to the dangerous Mediterranean Sea route, numerous crises in Africa, and the problem of refugees being turned away in Southeast Asia. According to the group:<blockquote>The global refugee crisis will not be solved unless the international community recognizes that it is a global problem and deals with it as such. Refugees are&#8212;by definition&#8212;people who no longer enjoy the protection of their state because that state will not or cannot protect them. They are people who have fled armed conflict, persecution, violence and grave human rights abuses.</blockquote>AI called on world leaders to take eight key actions: hold an international summit; ratify the Refugee Convention; develop robust domestic refugee systems; commit absolutely to saving lives first; combat trafficking; fulfill resettlement needs identified by the UN Refugee Agency; combat xenophobia; and establish a global refugee fund.</p>

<p>Refuges from the conflicts in Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration issued a joint statement calling on the EU to create a new <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">rescue operation program</a> [JURIST report] for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. Also in April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February AI urged countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/amnesty-urges-countries-to-support-refugee-programs-for-syria-expatriates.php">show public support to Syrian refugees</a> [JURIST report] through resettlement and other humanitarian admission programs </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudan President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16010445">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile] was allowed to leave South Africa on Monday, despite a ruling by the <a href="http://www.judiciary.org.za/high-courts.html">North Gauteng High Court</a> [official website] that he should be <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/south-africa-court-bars-sudan-president-from-leaving-country.php">kept in the country</a> [JURIST report] because of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/Pages/icc02050109.aspx">warrants</a> [ICC materials] for his arrest. Shortly after he left, the High Court issued its own order for his arrest. Bashir was visiting South Africa for an <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website] summit and had been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/south-africa-to-fight-omar-al-bashirs-arrest-warrant-sudan">offered immunity</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] during the summit by the South African government.

<p>The ICC has been struggling to investigate the situation in Darfur for years and has made little progress since 2009. In March the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-seeking-un-help-in-bashir-genocide-prosecution.php">requested assistance</a> [JURIST report] from the UN Security Council (UNSC) in the forced extradition of Bashir. In asking the UNSC to take "necessary measures" to force Sudan to comply with the ICC investigation, the court noted that without such assistance, the Council's decision to request investigation into al-Bashir in 2005 would "never achieve its ultimate goal." In February African leaders <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop cases Bashir and Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto or suspend the charges until African concerns are considered by the court. In December Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the UNSC that her office was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/icc-prosecutor-halts-darfur-investigation.php">dropping its investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the situation in Darfur. Knowing that the ICC lacks a policing force, Bashir responded that "they wanted us to kneel before the international criminal court but the ICC raised its hands and admitted that it had failed" and further stated that the Sudanese people had defeated the ICC. In June Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/icc-prosecutor-urges-un-action-in-darfur.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UNSC to take action to end the conflict in the Darfur region. Last March more than 30 human rights and civil society organizations <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/rights-groups-call-for-arrest-of-sudan-president.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for Bashir's arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2102164/ruling-in-a-i-g-bailout-lawsuit.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] bailout of <a href="http://www.aig.com/">AIG</a> [corporate website] in 2008 exceeded its authority but did not award any damages. The suit was brought by former AIG CEO Maurice Greenberg and claimed that the Federal Reserve's taking of a 79.9 percent equity share as consideration for bailout funds should be considered a taking without just compensation and an illegal exaction under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court ruled in favor of Greenberg declaring that the government acted "more harshly" towards AIG than other similarly placed institutions and declared that the Federal Reserve's action was "an illegal exaction under the Fifth Amendment." However, the court refrained from imposing damages as it found Greenberg and other shareholders failed to prove that they were damaged by the taking. The court stated that if the government had not intervened, AIG would have been forced to file for bankruptcy and the shares in question would have been worthless.</p>

<p>AIG has been part numerous lawsuits concerning the 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7748874.stm">financial crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In March a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/aig-to-pay-nearly-1-billion-to-shareholders-in-class-action-settlement.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $970.5 million settlement between AIG and that shareholders who said they were misled about the company's subprime mortgage exposure. In April 2013 the same court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-approves-aig-settlement.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $115 million settlement between AIG shareholders and the company's former CEO and other executives in order to resolve allegations that the insurer misled investors about financial records. In September 2010 a class-action case moved forward against former AIG chief executive Martin Sullivan, former executive for AIG's subsidiary Joseph Cassano and multiple other former chief and senior executives among accusations of <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-aid-fraud-suit.php">fraudulent intent to mislead the market</a> [JURIST report] and failing to disclose to its shareholders the risks the company was taking in issuing sub-prime mortgages. In May 2010 the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/doj-drops-criminal-probe-of-aig-exec.php">decided not to file charges</a> [JURIST report] against Cassano, ending a two-year criminal investigation of several executives from AIG's Financial Products subsidiary, which played a large role in constructing complex contracts known as <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1723152,00.html">credit-default swaps</a> [TIME backgrounder] that insured bond losses tied to the US housing market. In 2009 former AIG executives <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/former-aig-executives-settle-sec.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21170.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] brought by the SEC alleging their involvement in inflating the company's reported financial records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Romania's <a href="http://www.csm1909.ro/csm/index.php?cmd=91">Superior Magistrates' Council</a> [official webcite] on Monday rejected 22 proposals that would have made it harder to fight top-level corruption. The proposals, developed by the governing <a href="http://www.psd.ro/">Social Democratic Party</a> [party website, in Romanian], would have changed the law to make it harder to arrest lawmakers for corruption-related offenses including <a href="http://expertforum.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Conflicts-of-interest-and-incompatibilities-in-Eastern-Europe.-Romania-Croatia-Moldova.pdf">conflict of interest</a> [EFOR backgrounder]. Although the decision is not binding, Justice Minister <a href="http://www.mae.ro/en/node/2032">Robert Cazanciuc</a> [MFA bio] said he intends to recommend that the <a href="http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.home?idl=2">Romanian Parliament</a> [official website] refuse any such changes. The magistrates' body's decision comes in the wake of an announcement ten days ago that prosecutors suspect Premier <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17776564">Victor Ponta</a> [BBC profile] of money laundering, forgery, tax evasion and conflict of interest. </p>

<p>Romania is one of the most corrupt nations in the EU, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#ROU_DataResearch_SurveysIndices">ranking</a> [TI profile] 69 out of the 177 nations globally according to the watchdog group Transparency International. In April former Senior Judge Stan Mustata was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/romania-judge-sentenced-to-10-years-for-accepting-bribes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to over 10 years in prison for granting favorable verdicts to defendants in exchange for money. In January 2014 the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-warns-romania-over-continued-corruption-judicial-concerns.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its semi-annual Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report on Romania, warning the nation to end political pressure on the judiciary amid continuing concerns over corruption. In September 2013 Romanian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/romania-prosecutors-charge-former-prison-chief-with-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Communist-era prison commander Alexander Visinescu with genocide. Visinescu, the former chief of the Ramnicu Sarat prison under Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu faces genocide charges for beating and starving political prisoners between 1956 and 1963, the height of Communist repression against dissidents. In January the Bucharest Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/romanian-court-approves-extradition-of-ex-defense-official-to-us.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a former Romanian defense ministry official can be extradited to the US on charges of trying to illegally export military equipment to Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.coloradosupremecourt.com">Colorado Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday unanimously <a href="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0615/20150615_085459_coats-vs-dish.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision that employers' zero tolerance drug policies are not pre-empted by Colorado's legalization of medical marijuana. The court held that an employee can legally be discharged for consuming marijuana off-duty, as a plain meaning reading of the state's lawful off duty activities statute implies that "lawful" is intended to protect only those activities that are permissible under both state and federal law. The opinion emphasizes that "employees who engage in an activity, such as medical marijuana use, that is permitted by state law but unlawful under federal law are not protected by the statute." While the decision grants employers the ability to impose zero-tolerance policies, it does not require it. Colorado law permits employers to implement drug policies of their choosing, with many employers opting to eliminate THC from pre-employment drug screens. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legalization of medical marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has gained much support in recent years, and to date, has seen the drug fully or partially legalized by 21 states and the District of Columbia. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, creating conflicts. In early March a bipartisan group of three US Senators introduced a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/senators-introduce-bill-to-lift-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would loosen governmental regulation, and notably, allow states to enact their own medical marijuana statutes without federal interference. A few days later, an identical companion bill was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/medical-marijuana-bill-introduced-in-us-house.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the Us House of Representatives. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/govt/eng/GovtByNumber_eng.asp">Cabinet of Israel</a> [official website] on Sunday approved a bill allowing the force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike if their lives are at risk. Entitled <a href="http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/State/Law/Pages/Artificial-nutrition-for-hunger-strikers-June-2014.aspx">Preventing Damage from Hunger Strikes</a> [materials], the law would require doctors to exhaust other means of ending a hunger strike before using force-feeding. Proponents of the bill say it would <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Cabinet-approves-bill-to-allow-force-feeding-hunger-striking-prisoners-405980">remove suicide-by-starvation</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] as a political tool for prisoners. But opponents, including <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/">Physicians for Human Rights-Israel</a> [advocacy website] criticized the proposal in a <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/default.asp?PageID=116&ItemID=1936">letter</a> [text] last year, saying "The force-feeding process is inherently cruel, inhuman, and degrading." The bill must now be approved by the <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Knesset</a> [official website] before becoming law.</p>

<p>The law first gained notoriety after<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/israel-force-feeding-law-palestinian-hunger-strikers"> Palestinian prisoners engaged in a hunger-strike last year</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and relations between Israel and Palestine continue to be a significant international legal issue. In April, a UN independent board of inquiry announced that it uncovered evidence that at least <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-israel-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-in-gaza.php">44 Palestinians were killed by "Israeli actions"</a> [JURIST report] while sheltering at UN locations during last year's Gaza war. In March the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-annual-humanitarian-overview-for-the-situation-in-palestine-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its 2014 Annual Humanitarian Overview, noting that Palestinian civilians continue to face daily threats to their physical safety and liberty, with 2014 holding the highest civilian death toll in the conflict since the annexation of the Palestinian territories in 1967. Also in March the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights told the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] that human rights violations "<a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-condemns-violations-in-gaza-conflic.php">fuel and shape the conflict</a>" [JURIST report] in the occupied Palestinian territories. In November the UN Human Rights Council<a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-body-urges-israel-to-investigate-alleged-war-crimes.php"> urged Israel to investigate</a> [JURIST report] alleged violations committed by its forces during the recent conflict in Gaza. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.privacycommission.be/">Belgian Privacy Commission</a> [official website] announced Monday that it is suing <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">Facebook</a> [corporate website] for alleged violations of <a href="http://www.privacycommission.be/en/privacy-act-and-implementing-decrees">Belgian</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/">European privacy laws</a> [materials]. In May, the commission issued Facebook a <a href="http://www.privacycommission.be/sites/privacycommission/files/documents/recommendation_04_2015_0.pdf">set of recommendations</a> [text, PDF] urging the social media site to stop tracking users. Making the announcement, commission president <a href="http://www.ica.org/15326/speakers/willem-debeuckelaere.html">Willem Debeuckelaere</a> [ICA profile] <a href="http://www.demorgen.be/technologie/privacycommissie-daagt-facebook-voor-de-rechtbank-a2358506/">said</a> [DeMorgen report, in Dutch] "we cannot continue to negotiate through other means.... We want a judge to impose our recommendations. These recommendations are chiefly aimed at protecting internet users who are not Facebook members." Facebook <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/15/us-facebook-belgium-idUSKBN0OV1YQ20150615">has responded</a> [Reuters report] to the commission's lawsuit, saying it should only be subject to the laws of Ireland, where its European data centers are located.</p>

<p>Online privacy has become a matter of increasing concern around the world in recent years. In March 92 non-governmental organizations from around the world issued a <a href="http://icj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Advocacy-HRC28-Privacy-JointOralStatement-2015.docx">statement</a> [text] calling on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/rights/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/ngos-call-for-establishment-of-un-special-rapporteur-on-privacy.php">institute</a> [JURIST report] a Special Rapporteur on Privacy. Earlier that month the District Court of The Hague <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dutch-court-holds-data-retention-law-violates-privacy.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Dutch data retention law, holding that it violates privacy rights of EU citizens. Last July former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-rights-chief-criticizes-secrecy-in-governmental-surveillance.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the widespread lack of transparency in governmental digital surveillance practices. Also in July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">Secret Intelligence Service</a> [official website], alleging that the agency unlawfully accesses private data from undersea cables. Last April the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/european-court-of-justice-rules-data-collection-too-invasive.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] an EU-wide law that stipulates how private data must be collected and stored.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK Prime Minister <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/david-cameron">David Cameron</a> [official profile] on Monday renewed his call for the country to repeal the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42">Human Rights Act</a> [materials] and institute its own bill of rights in an <a href="http://www.sunnation.co.uk/david-cameron-why-im-determined-to-scrap-the-human-rights-act/">article for the Sun newspaper</a> [Sun op-ed]. Cameron made the call the same day he gave a  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/magna-carta-800th-anniversary-pms-speech">speech</a> [text] celebrating the <a href="/forum/2015/06/victor-williams-magna-carta.php">800th anniversary</a> [JURIST feature] of the signing of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/">Magna Carta</a> [materials], a historical UK document seen as one of the first statements of human rights. Cameron said he favored a new law on rights because the Human Rights Act, based on the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], gave too much deference to authorities outside the country. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International UK</a> [official website] (AI) head Allan Hogarth <a href="http://savetheact.uk/magna-carta-human-rights-are-not-a-gift-to-be-bestowed-upon-us-by-monarchs-barons-or-politicians/">criticized</a> [blog post] Cameron's call, saying human rights do not differ country-by-country.</p>

<p>The UK government has recently been criticized by human rights groups for its surveillance and other anti-terrorism measures. In April, AI announce an <a href="/paperchase/IOR6014152015ENGLISH.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], bringing claims of indiscriminate surveillance practices against the UK government.  In February, the <a href="http://www.ipt-uk.com/">Investigatory Powers Tribunal</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of internet activities violates human rights law. Last July, civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK's Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6, alleging that the agency accesses data from undersea cables in violation of the rights to private life and freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court upheld the death sentence of deposed president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi+">news archive</a>] on Tuesday after consulting the grand Mufti, Egypt's highest religious figure and a government advisor on Islamic law. The death sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">originally imposed</a> [JURIST report] in May, with more than 100 other defendants sentenced to death <em>in absentia</em>. The sentences were ordered as a punishment for involvement in the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and prison break that ousted then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile]. Also on Tuesday Morsi was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/egyptian-court-confirms-morsi-death-sentence-over-jailbreak-during-uprising">sentenced</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to life in prison for spying and "colluding with foreign governments." <a href="http://www.fjponline.com"> Muslim Brotherhood Freedom and Justice Party</a> [party website] spokesman Nader Oman <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/egypt-court-upholds-morsi-death-sentence-150616104041261.html">expressed surprise</a> [Al Jazeera report] and said the defendants were not given an opportunity to defend themselves. The verdict may be appealed to Egypt's highest court.</p>

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] has been facing legal challenges, particularly in Egypt. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/morsi-goes-on-trial-over-espionage-allegations.php">put Morsi on trial</a> [JURIST report] over accusations of spying and leaking information to Qatar. Earlier in February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] on bail of two Al Jazeera journalists being retried on terror charges. Baher Mohammed and Mohammed Fahmy have spent more than 400 days in jail after a court found them guilty for falsifying news reports and associating with the Muslim Brotherhood. Also that month a court in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentence-for-183-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">confirmed death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 183 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted president Mohammed Morsi. In October an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/egypt-jails-muslim-brotherhood-leaders-for-15-years-over-lawyers-torture.php">jailed eight men</a> [JURIST report], including two Muslim Brotherhood leaders, for 15 years over the torture of a lawyer during 2011 uprisings against former president Hosni Mubarak. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov">New York Senate</a> [official website] on Monday passed a <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/A7060-2015">medical marijuana bill</a> [materials] that would expedite access to marijuana for emergency medical purposes. The bill, <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/06/8570266/senate-approves-expedited-access-medical-marijuana">passed</a> [<em>Capital</em> report] by a Republican-led Senate in a 50-12 vote, would allow people with "progressive and degenerative" diseases or whose lives are at risk to have better access to marijuana. Opponents of the bill had wanted a specific provision allowing early access to marijuana for young children with debilitating conditions that could be treated on a short-term basis with the drug.The bill has already passed the <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/">New York Assembly</a> [official website] and now awaits approval by <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile].</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes has created controversy among a number of states in the US in the past few years. Earlier this month the Louisiana House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/louisiana-legislature-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a medical marijuana bill to provide a legal way to supply therapeutic marijuana to patients who need it. In May the Pennsylvania Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/pennsylvania-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a similar medical marijuana bill that would allow medical marijuana products to be grown by licensed cultivation facilities and distributed through state-regulated dispensaries. Also in May Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/puerto-rico-governor-signs-executive-order-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order legalizing medical marijuana. The order referred to several US studies that show the therapeutic use of the plant in treating different medical conditions including pain associated with AIDS, glaucoma, migraines, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases. The Governor further noted that several US states have already legalized medical marijuana for these uses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] issued a pre-trial order Monday accepting another court's finding of racial profiling by Maricopa County Sheriff <a href="http://www.mcso.org/About/Sheriff.aspx">Joe Arpaio</a> [official profile]. Hearing a lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] (DOJ), US District Court Judge Roslyn Silver <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/06/16/sheriff-joe-arpaio-dog-suit-judge-ruling/28787635/">accepted the finding</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] from a previous case brough by the ACLU that found Arpaio racially profiled against Hispanic drivers in traffic stops and said the DOJ would not need to litigate this issue. The DOJ filed charges against the Sheriff's Office for discriminatory practices in traffic stops, work and home raids, and in county jails, as well as claims of retaliation. The remaining issues will be argued at trial, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/us-usa-arizona-arpaio-idUSKBN0OW02Z20150616">scheduled</a> [Reuters report] for August 10 in Phoenix. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/doj-files-discrimination-suit-against-arizona-sheriff.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] the suit alleging discriminatory conduct against Maricopa County, Arizona, the MCSO and Arpaio in 2012.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in April that Arpaio, engaged in <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ninth-circuit-rules-arizona-county-police-engaged-in-racial-profiling.php">practices of racial profiling</a> [JURIST report] when conducting traffic stops. In January,  a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-2.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Maricopa County officials may not enforce two Arizona identity-theft laws used to convict hundreds of undocumented immigrant workers. In October of last year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-orders-arizona-sheriff-to-undergo-racial-profiling-training.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Arpaio to undergo the same training as his deputies to assist in the prevention of racial profiling and unlawful detention in the Sheriff's Office as part of the ongoing case against Arpaio for racial profiling. In 2013 a federal judge ruled that Arpaio and his department engaged in <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-court-rules-arizona-sheriff-violated-latinos-constitutional-rights.php">unconstitutional racial profiling</a> [JURIST report] during the execution of immigration patrols.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] announced Tuesday that food manufacturers will be given three years to <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm451237.htm">remove all partially hydrogenated oils</a> [press release] (PHOs), the main ingredient in artificial trans fat, saying they are no longer "generally recognized as safe." After June 18, 2018 no PHOs can be added to human food unless specifically approved by the FDA. The administration explained this decision followed extensive scientific research and consideration of over 6000 comments received since 2013 and the agency believes it will lead to reduced coronary disease and fewer fatal heart attacks. The FDA <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-14883.pdf">estimated</a> [order, PDF] that costs of this action over the next 20 years would be $6 billion, including food packaging and relabeling, finding substitute ingredients and restaurant changes. However, the expected health benefits are valued at over $130 billion over the same 20 years.</p>

<p>The FDA is responsible for the nation's food safety as well as drugs and medical devices and products. Last month the agency <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/fda-plans-to-ease-restrictions-on-gay-blood-donors.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a set of proposed guidelines outlining a plan to end the national lifetime ban on blood donations from homosexual individuals. Last February, the FDA published a letter <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/fda-declines-to-define-natural-in-the-context-of-food-products.php">declining</a> [JURIST report] to define &#8220;natural&#8221; in the context of food labeling in response to three cases involving allegations of false advertising of food products. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in July 2013 that the FDA policy allowing the importation of a drug used in the execution of state prisoners was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fda-cannot-allow-import-of-execution-drug.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16087&LangID=E">renewed calls</a> [press release] for womens and girls to be given equal access to education. A discussion panel held by OHCHR said equal educational rights is way to end discrimination against women that is "so deeply etched in many societies." The panel said gender discrimination has manifested itself in the forms of sexual violence, abductions and harassment, as well as higher rates of unemployment and unequal pay. The discussion highlighted the thousands of <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">attacks on schools</a> [JURIST report] that took place in at least 70 different countries between the years of 2009 and 2014, many of which were aimed at advocates for girls' educational rights. Through equal education, OHCHR contends that women will be able to utilize their learned skills to circumvent the so-called "ceiling" that often prevents them from achieving similar status to their male counterparts. </p>

<p>Despite international efforts to <a href="/dateline/2015/01/anjelica-violi-educating-men.php">educate communities</a> [JURIST op-ed] and protect women's rights to be free from discrimination, women worldwide still face inequality that is frequently due to a lack of governmental support. In April the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-afghanistan-should-strengthen-justice-system-to-protect-women.php">urged the government of Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] to provide women protection against domestic violence within the state. Also in April Amnesty International reported that Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram has <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-boko-haram-has-arrested-at-least-2000-women-since-2014.php">abducted at least 2,000 women and girls</a> [JURIST report] since the start of 2014, subjecting some to forced-marriage.The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women also <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-urge-tanzania-to-prevent-discrimination-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Tanzania to enforce its international obligations to prevent discrimination against women, after two women brought suit arguing that customary laws enforced in their communities contravened Tanzania's constitution and its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. In March the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-progress-made-on-womens-equality-under-constant-threat.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the progress made in achieving women's rights remains under continuous threat, as "no country in the world has achieved full substantive equality of women."  In February the UN reported that in at least 70 countries, women and girls have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">attacked for seeking education </a>[JURIST report], which is seen as a challenge to existing gender-based systems of oppression. Also that month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">reported attacks</a> [JURIST report] on young girls for seeking an education in at least 70 countries. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] handed down a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62014CJ0062&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre=">ruling</a> [text] Tuesday that strengthened the role of the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank </a> (ECB) [official website] in mediating financial markets. The Court upheld the ECB's 2012 offer to purchase the bonds of countries whose governments that would otherwise face high borrowing costs. The Court disagreed with a German group's challenge that the ECB overstepped its legal powers by using its monetary powers to provide financial aid to governments. ECB official <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvmersch.en.html">Yves Mersch</a> [official website] said that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/european-court-to-rule-on-key-anti-crisis-program/307529281/">the bank was satisfied</a> [AP report] with the Court's decision here in "erring on the side of prudence" with its powers. </p>

<p>The ECB has played a crucial role in trying to remedy the financial crisis within the Eurozone. In March the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">General Court of the European Union </a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/eu-court-annuls-european-central-bank-oversight-requirement.php">annulled a portion </a> [JURIST report] a portion of the ECB's Eurosystem Oversight Policy Framework requiring financial institutions clearing trades in euros to be located in the Eurozone. In January EU Advocate General Cruz Villalon <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/eu-legal-advisor-supports-ecbs-bond-purchase-plan.php">gave legal support</a> [JURIST report] to the ECB plan to purchase government bonds as an attempt to remedy the financial crisis in the Eurozone. In September 2013 the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-parliament-approves-new-bank-supervisory-mechanism.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that created a system of banking supervision overseen by a new centralized bank supervision authority supported by the ECB. The regulation puts in place a single supervisory mechanism that will cover 150 of the largest banks in the 17 Eurozone nations.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bahraini court on Tuesday sentenced prominent Shiite leader <a href="http://www.alwefaq.net/wefaqsg/?page_id=11">Sheikh Ali Salman</a> [official profile] to four years in prison for insulting the <a href="http://www.interior.gov.bh/default_en.aspx">Interior Ministry</a> [official website], inciting others to break the law, and inciting hatred against naturalized Sunnis. Salman is the secretary-general of the <a href="http://alwefaq.net/cmsen/">Al-Wefaq</a> [official website] political opposition group, and was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/bahrain-prosecutors-charge-prominent-shiite-leader.php">arrested in late December</a> [JURIST report] for speeches made between 2012 and 2014. Salman was found <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_28321549/bahrain-shiite-opposition-leader-sentenced-4-years">not guilty</a> [AP report] for inciting violence and calling for the overthrow of the monarch. Had he been convicted for <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/prominent-shiite-leader-faces-trial-in-bahrain.php">those offenses</a> [JURIST report], Salman could have faced a life sentence in prison.</p>

<p>Bahrain has been the center of tension between police and protestors since protests began in the country in 2011. In April reforms in Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-bahrain-government-reforms-have-failed-to-end-rights-violations.php">failed to end</a> [JURIST report] serious human rights violations, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International </a>(AI) [advocacy website] reported. The report claimed that activists were still being jailed and detainees were mistreated and tortured. In February a Bahraini court found <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-court-convicts-11-of-deadly-police-attack.php">11 Shiites guilty of an attack</a> [JURIST report] carried out against police 2013, and three Shiites were sentenced to death as a result. The other eight defendants were sentenced to life in prison, and their citizenship was stripped. Also in February Bahrain's Ministry of Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">initiated a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged criminal content posted by the country's main opposition group, the Al-Wefaq. In early February a group of <a href="paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-experts-urge-bahrain-to-release-political-opposition-leader.php">UN human rights urged </a> [JURIST report] the Bahrain government to release Salman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://intermedia.gp.gov.ua/home">Ukraine Prosecutor General</a> [official website] on Wednesday revealed that two government soldiers have been detained for alleged links to the murders of two women who sympathized with armed separatists from the east. It is <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/06/17/ukrainian-soldiers-accused-of-murdering-civilians">reported</a> [AP report] that earlier this week the soldiers broke into the home of the victims in village of Luhanske and shot them both dead. The two women were a mother and daughter whose ages were 77 and 45. Complaints of mistreatment of civilians by Ukrainian soldiers have become prevalent, which has lead to ongoing investigations by the Ukrainian government.  </p>

<p>Russia's ongoing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">conflict</a> [BBC timeline] with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ukraine">Ukraine</a> [JURIST news archive] has reinvigorated fears of Cold War Era politics and increased tensions between Russia and the West. In late February <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">US Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/john-kerry-says-us-considering-new-sanctions-against-russia.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Washington is considering "additional sanctions" against Russia in light of the most recent events in Ukraine. Also in late February a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-officials-voice-concern-over-ukraine-ceasefire.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that he had spoken with Ukraine Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin regarding the ceasefire in Ukraine. Ban expressed concern over the situation and informed Klimkin that the UN would continue to follow the Security Council's guidance. Earlier in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-escalated-fighting-in-ukraine.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] both sides of the Ukraine conflict to halt "the dangerous escalation in the fighting" in response to the human rights "situation in the east of the country." In January the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-death-toll-in-ukraine-exceeds-5000.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] saying that at least 5,086 people have been killed since the conflict in Ukraine began in April 2014, but expressed concerns that the real figure may be much higher.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] announced on Wednesday that it <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/att-mobility-faces-100m-fine-misleading-consumers">plans</a> [press release] to fine <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&T Mobile</a> [corporate website] 100 million dollars for their actions in slowing internet speeds after "unlimited data" users reached a certain limit. The FCC claims that AT&T slowed down internet speeds for unlimited users and failed to notify them that they would receive slower speeds than advertised. AT&T is believed to be in violation of the 2010 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/guides/open-internet-transparency-rule">Open Internet Transparency Rule</a> [FCC materials] by advertising unlimited policies without information on slowing access after a data limit is reached. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler stated in regards to the fine, "[a]s today&#8217;s action demonstrates, the Commission is committed to holding accountable those broadband providers who fail to be fully transparent about data limits.&#8221; It is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/17/us-at-t-fcc-fine-idUSKBN0OX22220150617">reported</a> [Reuters report] that AT&T will challenge the fine which has now become the largest handed down to any entity by the FCC. </p>

<p>The way Internet Service Providers (ISPs) manage customers' access speed is an issue the FCC has <a href="/feature/2015/04/net-neutrality---fcc-actions.php">frequently addressed</a> [JURIST feature] recently. In March, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/fcc-facing-first-lawsuits-over-net-neutrality.php">faced its first lawsuits</a> for so-called "net-neutrality" rules it <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/fcc-adopts-open-internet-rules.php">adopted</a> in February after Wheeler <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/fcc-chairman-proposes-regulating-internet-like-a-public-utility.php">recommended</a> [JURIST reports] that ISPs be regulated like public utilities. Doing so gives the FCC broader authority to regulate them. Previous attempts by the FCC to impose net-neutrality rules had been <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-internet-providers-to-block-or-prioritize-web-traffic.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by an appeals court because ISPs had not historically been regulated like public utilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling, which was handed down on June 3, only <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/17/us-uber-california-idUSKBN0OX1TE20150617">became known to the public</a> [Reuters report] on Tuesday after Uber appealed it in state court in San Francisco. The commission had previously found in 2012 that Uber drivers are independent contractors due to factors such as the drivers being able to set their own hours. However, in this case the commission looked to other factors and found that Uber is involved in all aspects of operation, qualifying the drivers as employees. Uber said in a <a href="http://newsroom.uber.com/2015/06/clcstatement/">statement</a> [press release], "It's important to remember that the number one reason drivers choose to use Uber is because they have complete flexibility and control. The majority of them can and do choose to earn their living from multiple sources, including other ride sharing companies." The ruling could lead to higher costs for the company, as they may have to begin to pay for such benefits as workers' compensation, Social Security and unemployment insurance.</p>

<p>Uber has faced a series of legal challenges in recent months. One <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_27102694/biz-break-san-francisco-and-l-sue-uber">lawsuit</a> [Silicon Valley report] that was filed on December 9, 2014 alleges that Uber misleads consumers about their safety, overcharges them and completely disregards California law. San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey <a href="/dateline/2015/01/danielle-ardner-uber-safety.php">stated</a> [JURIST commentary], "Uber has refused to comply with straightforward California laws that protect consumers from fraud and harm... These companies can be innovative in the way they deliver services without ignoring the laws that protect the public." Uber's rival, Lyft, also based in San Francisco, <a href="http://time.com/3626922/san-francisco-los-angeles-uber-lyft/">settled</a> [Time report] with the city for $500,000 over similar accusations of making "false and misleading statements" to consumers over adequate background checks on their drivers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1c315c52-6598-4fed-908f-20e9a4996c35/1/doc/13-981_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1c315c52-6598-4fed-908f-20e9a4996c35/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a group of former top US officials may be held liable for the abuse of hundreds of detainees held for minor immigration violations after the events of <a href="/feature/featured/911/detail.php">September 11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In a 2-1 ruling the court ruled that former Attorney General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1120440.stm">John Ashcroft</a> [BBC profile], former FBI director <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/directors/mueller">Robert Mueller</a> [official profile] and the former head of an immigration agency may have gone too far in attempting to find the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks, violating the Constitution in the process: <blockquote>Detaining individuals as if they were terrorists, in the most restrictive conditions of confinement available, simply because these individuals were, or appeared to be, Arab or Muslim exceeds those limits... It might well be that national security concerns motivated the defendants to take action, but that is of little solace to those who felt the brunt of that decision. The suffering endured by those who were imprisoned merely because they were caught up in the hysteria of the days immediately following 9/11 is not without a remedy.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The abuse was detailed in a justice department inspector general <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/special/0306/">report</a> [document, PDF] noting that detainees were subject to strip searches, beatings, broken bones and verbal abuse. </p>

<p>Allegations of prisoner <a href="/feature/2013/07/guantanamo-bay-torture-allegations.php">abuse and torture</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have been levied against the department and its contractors for several years. In March a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dod-ordered-to-release-photographs-of-detainee-abuse-in-iraq-afghanistan.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the DOD must release photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last July the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/federal-appeals-court-reviews-abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuit.php">district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over a case of alleged torture in the Abu Ghraib prison because the alleged abuses occurred in Iraq. In 2013 a military contractor that was accused of conspiring to torture detainees in a lawsuit by former detainees of Abu Ghraib has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-contractor-pays-5-million-settlement-in-lawsuits-alleging-torture-at-abu-ghraib.php">paid $5.28 million to former detainees</a> [JURIST report] held at the prison and other US detention centers in Iraq. A 14-judge panel for the Fourth Circuit ruled 12-2 in 2012 that the earlier <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-torture-cases-against-abu-ghraib-contractors.php">dismissal</a> of lawsuits against two Abu Ghraib contractors on the grounds that they have immunity as government contractors was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-appeals-court-revives-lawsuits-against-abu-ghraib-contractors.php">premature</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-144_758b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/walker-v-texas-division-sons-of-confederate-veterans-inc">Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that state governments can restrict the kinds of messages printed on specialty licence plates. The <a href="http://www.scv.org/">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> [advocacy website] had argued that the Texas government's refusal to issue specialty licence plates including an image of the confederate flag violated <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder] free speech protections. Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Breyer rejected the argument, saying that because they are issued by the state, specialty license plates constitute <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/government_speech">government speech</a> [LII backgrounder] and are not held to the same level of scrutiny as other forms of speech:<blockquote>Indeed, a person who displays a message on a Texas license plate likely intends to convey to the public that the State has endorsed that message. If not, the individual could simply display the message in question in larger letters on a bumper sticker right next to the plate. But the individual prefers a license plate design to the purely private speech expressed through bumper stickers. That may well be because Texas&#8217;s license plate designs convey government agreement with the message displayed.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The decision reversed an earlier <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C13/13-50411-CV0.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-specialty-license-plates.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case last December and <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-government-speech-warrantless-entry-into-a-residency.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_11-cv-03659/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_11-cv-03659-15.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Minnesota's sex offender program and civil commitment statutes are unconstitutional, but has chosen to await further proceedings on a remedy before taking any immediate action. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/involuntary_civil_commitment">civil commitment</a> [LII backgrounder] program allows the state to detain individuals with "acute symptoms of severe mental illness," and rarely ever releases them. Over 700 sex offenders have been indefinitely detained because of this. The justification is that these are individuals who may commit a crime in the future, and that society is better with them off the streets. However, the court noted that "[i]t is fundamental to our notions of a free society that we do not imprison citizens because we fear that they might commit a crime in the future." The court said these programs constitute a form of "preventative detention" that is prohibited in the justice system except in very limited circumstances, not met in this case.</p>

<p>In other countries, controversial laws pertaining to the preventative detention of prisoners deemed a threat to public safety have also come under fire. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/amnesty-international-concerned-about-extrajudicial-detentions-in-jammu-and-kashmir.php">rights groups called for reform</a> [JURIST report] of a Kashmir law they allege is being used to detain people despite the absence of sufficient evidence for a trial. Last year, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/077671A.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that, unlike Minnesota's finding, a federal law allowing for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-court-upholds-indefinite-detention-of-mentally-ill-sex-offenders.php">indefinite detention of mentally ill sex offenders was constitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] United Nations <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx"> Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression</a> [UN backgrounder] David Kaye on Wednesday issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session29/Documents/A.HRC.29.32_AEV.doc">report</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16095&LangID=E">press release</a>] calling the use of anonymity and encryption software in digital communication vital to free speech. Kaye noted that due to heightened online security and mass and targeted surveillance and data collection, individuals use encryption and anonymity to provide themselves with "online security." However, he recognized such encryption and anonymity have the potential to inhibit criminal investigations pertaining to financial crimes, illicit drugs, child pornography, and terrorism. In concluding, Kaye urged that restrictions on encryption and anonymity must be "strictly limited according to principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and legitimacy in objective."</p>

<p>Government surveillance policies around the world have been hotly debated recently. Earlier this month the US Senate approved the USA Freedom Act, which <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-senate-votes-to-reduce-governments-mass-surveillance-powers.php">reduces the federal government's surveillance</a> [JURIST report] of Americans' phone records. In March a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dutch-court-holds-data-retention-law-violates-privacy.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] its data retention law, holding that it violates privacy rights of EU citizens. Also in March France's government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">pushed a surveillance bill</a> [JURIST report] that would give French intelligence services the authority to monitor metadata.  Such focus on government surveillance policies comes largely as a result of <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">revelations</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1433_bpm1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/brumfield-v-cain/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Brumfield v. Cain</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a man who was convicted in 1993 for killing a police officer in Louisiana is entitled to have a new hearing to determine if he is mentally disabled, making him ineligible for the death penalty. The court decided that Kevan Brumfield, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993 for killing Cpl. Betty Smothers, must have his intellectual capacity reevaluated under the 2002 ruling <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2001/2001_00_8452/">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [Oyez Project backgrounder]. The court in <u>Atkins</u> ruled that a it was a violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] to execute a person convicted of a capital crime if that person is mentally disabled. Writing for the court in <u>Brumfield</u>, Justice Sonia Sotomayor found that a Louisiana state court unreasonably found that Brumfield was not entitled to a hearing on his mental capacity. The decision vacated an earlier <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ca5-12-30256/pdf/USCOURTS-ca5-12-30256-0.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito filed dissenting opinions, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice John Roberts, saying that the ruling was intruding on the state of Louisiana's right to enforce its laws as it sees fit. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-specialty-license-plates.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in December and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-determining-mental-incapacity-for-capital-punishment.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1428_n64o.pdf">reinstated</a> [opinion, PDF] the death sentence of a California man convicted of murder 25 years ago, despite evidence that seven of the prosecution&#8217;s peremptory challenges to jurors in the case were race-based. In a 5-4 decision, the majority held in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/chappell-v-ayala/">Davis v. Ayala</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that even though all blacks and Hispanics available to serve on the jury were dismissed by the prosecution in Ayala's capital murder trial, the error was harmless. The opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, reiterated the high bar a petitioner must overcome in a federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus"><em>habeas</em></a> [LII backgrounder] claim to demonstrate that the state court's error during trial was harmful. The trial judge found the prosecution's reasons for dismissing the jurors were not raced based, and the court found Ayala failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by this procedure. The decision reversed an earlier <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1658366.html">ruling</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, argues that the trial judge heard the prosecutions reasons for striking the potential black and Hispanic jurors behind closed doors without Ayala and his attorney present, substantially influencing the outcome of the case and and that this should have been enough to demonstrate a harmful error. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-to-rule-on-hotel-guest-registries.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in October and heard oral arguments in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ohio-v-clark/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Ohio v. Clark</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court decided that defendants do not have a constitutional right to cross-examine child witnesses. The only instance in which they have this right is if the child made the statements with the primary intention of creating evidence for the prosecution. But writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the motivation for a teacher's conversation with a child is to protect them rather than build a case against a suspect:<br />
<blockquote>Mandatory reporting obligations do not convert a conversation between a concerned teacher and her student into a law enforcement mission aimed at gathering evidence for prosecution.</blockquote>The decision reversed an earlier <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2012-0215-Ohio.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmakers voted Thursday to reject a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong's leader to be elected by the general public. After a lengthy debate, 28 legislators <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/18/hong-kong-election-reforms_n_7609330.html">voted against</a> [AP report] the proposal, enough to defeat the measure. The Chinese government, which had supported the legislation, said it was <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/18/c_134338831.htm">disappointed in the vote</a> [Xinhua report], but opponents said the bill still gave the central Chinese government too much control over the process.</p>

<p>China's human rights record has garnered international attention for the government's treatment of the growing <a href="/forum/2014/10/shubhankar-dam-hong-kong.php">civil rights movement</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the country, led by a number of prominent rights activists and attorneys. In September, the Hong Kong police department <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/hong-kong-police-arrest-pro-democracy-protestors.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] the main government compound of pro-democracy supporters who occupied the area in protest. Last June, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/china-court-denies-bail-to-human-rights-lawyer.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer, Pu Zhiqiang, who is likely to be indicted in the country's attempt to deter growing legal activism. Pu was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/china-detains-rights-lawyer-ahead-of-tiananmen-square-anniversary.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] last month for "causing a disturbance" after he attended a weekend meeting that urged an investigation into the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. Many believe that the government's actions against Pu are intended to set an example, in hopes of silencing the growing dissonance and social activism amongst lawyers in China. Last May Chinese officials in the western region of Xinjiang <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/china-officials-sentence-55-in-public-rally.php">held a public rally</a> [JURIST report] at a sports stadium for the mass sentencing of criminals. While three of the 55 sentenced were convicted for crimes including "violent terrorism," other prisoners' crimes ranged from separatism to participation in terrorism groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French court acquitted 14 companies accused of bribery on Thursday for negotiating contracts as part of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/">UN oil-for-food program</a> [official website; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=oil-for-food">JURIST news archive</a>] with the Iraqi government under <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saddam+hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive]. The oil-for-food program allowed the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein, which was under UN sanctions in the wake of the first Gulf War, to sell limited stocks of oil in return for foodstuffs and other humanitarian supplies. In Thursday's trial, Renault Trucks, Schneider Electric and Legrand, and several other French companies were <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/france-clears-14-firms-bribery-oil-food-program-31857538">found not guilty</a> [AP report] of bribery, corruption and misuse of company assets. In a 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/france-oil-company-ceo-acquitted-in-iraq-oil-for-food-scandal.php">trial</a> [JURIST report], other French companies, including oil conglomerate Total, also were acquitted.</p>

<p>The oil-for-food program, established in 1996, was extremely controvercial. In February 2013 a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York </a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-dismisses-iraq-oil-for-food-corruption-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] an Iraqi government lawsuit accusing numerous business entities of conspiring with Hussein to disrupt the program, thereby denying Iraqi citizens access to approximately $10 billion of essential aid. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric</a> (GE) [corporate website] agreed to a $23.5 million settlement after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint accusing GE of <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ge-agrees-to-settle-sec-complaint-in-oil-for-food-scandal.php">bribing Iraqi officials</a> [JURIST report] to receive contracts under the oil-for-food program. Additionally, oil company <a href="http://www.chevron.com/">Chevron</a> [corporate website] also<a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chevron-settles-sec-charges-in-oil-for.php"> paid a large settlement</a> [JURIST report] to the SEC concerning misuse of the program, and two Texan oil barons, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/texas-oil-company-owner-sentenced-to.php">David Chalmers</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/texas-oil-tycoon-sentenced-to-year-in.php">Oscar Wyatt Jr.</a> [JURIST reports], were sentenced to prison for their roles in the scandal. In 2005 Grundfos, a Danish company that produces industrial pumps, <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/danish-supplier-admits-role-in-un-oil.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that two employees paid kickbacks to authorities in Hussein's government under the oil-for-food program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="mailto:http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-378_k537.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mcfadden-v-united-states/">McFadden v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on Thursday that in a synthetic drug case, the government must prove that the defendant understood that he was dealing a substance regulated under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/802">Controlled Substances Act or Analogue Act</a> [21 USC §§ 802(32)(A), 813]. The ruling could make it more difficult for prosecutors to convict drug dealers selling chemically modified drugs that are not specifically banned by state and federal drug lists. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the unanimous opinion, where the Court held that prosecutors must prove that the defendant knew the substance was a controlled substance banned under federal law or that he knew the substance was an analog, with a chemical structure substantially similar to the banned drug. Stephen McFadden was convicted in 2013 under the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act for selling bath salts in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Act punishes those who knowingly or intentionally sell a controlled substance or analogue - a knock-off that has a &#8220;substantially similar&#8221; chemical structure and has similar effects of a banned substance. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] held that it was enough for a jury to find that McFadden intended the bath salts for human consumption. The justices disagreed, and the case has been sent back to the appeals court to determine whether the incorrect jury instruction was harmless. If it is found to be harmless, McFadden's conviction will stand.</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a concurring opinion. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in Janurary and heard <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-knowledge-requirement-for-drug-conviction.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/06/usa-all-50-states-fall-short-of-international-standards-on-police-use-of-lethal-force/">said</a> [AI report] Thursday that all 50 US states fall below international standards on police use of lethal force. The report indicates that many states have no regulation on police use of lethal force or ones that fall below international standards. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/UseOfForceAndFirearms.aspx">UN principles</a> [text] on the use of lethal force limit force to "unavoidable instance in order to protect life after less extreme means have failed," but the majority of states do not require police to use less-violent means before lethal force nor do they require them to identify their intent to use lethal force. The report also indicated that 13 US states fall below the US's own constitutional standards established in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1984/1984_83_1035">Tennessee v. Garner</a> [Oyez Project backgrounder] which states that police may not use deadly force to prevent a suspect from escaping "unless the officer believes that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others." An <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database">investigation</a> [<em>Gaurdian</em> report] revealed that 522 people have been killed by police this year and from those statistic black people were twice as likely as white people to be unarmed during the encounter. </p>

<p>Racial tension has recently mounted in the US following several police killings of unarmed black men. in January Judge Edgar Dickson of the South Carolina Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/south-carolina-judge-declares-mistrial-in-police-shooting-case.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in the murder case against a former police chief for the 2011 killing of an unarmed black man. After a grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who last year <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">shot and killed Micheal Brown </a>[USA Today Timeline], an African American teenager, there was a large uproar from the Ferguson community that led to mass protests and violence in some instances. The case had reached international news with AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/amnesty-ferguson-police-committed-human-rights-abuses.php">reporting</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses by Ferguson Police in late October. In early October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-rules-police-tactic-used-in-ferguson-protests-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the police tactics used on protesters was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">The American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also published a <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/aclu-report-criticizes-increased-police-militarization.php">report </a>[JURIST report] arguing that increased militarization of police forces is putting citizens at risk rather than protecting them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Amnesty International<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/06/cameroonillegaldetention/"> urged </a> [AI report] Cameroon Friday to end the six month detention of 84 children being held after a raid on Quranic schools. AI reports that some of the children were as young as five years old. The children remained detained in a children's center in Maroua even after being charged with no crimes. The government charged the teachers of the Quranic schools of running terrorist training camps for the Nigeria-based group Boko Haram. The raid is part of Cameroon governments on-going battle against the terrorist group. Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa stated "Detaining young children will do nothing to protect Cameroonians living under the threat of Boko Haram." AI has urged Cameroon to immediately release any children under the age of 15 to their parents and ensure a fair trial for any other's associated with the raid.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boko+haram">Boko Haram </a>[JURIST news archive], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. Last year <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch (HRW)</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-boko-haram-abuse-of-abductees-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Boko Haram had forced kidnapped women and girls to marry their captors and began using them for military tactical purposes. Boko Haram was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/un-rights-office-condemns-boko-haram-for-kidnappings.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] in May by the UN after it claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls in April and announced plans to sell and "marry them off." US President Obama promised to send resources for investigatory purposes, sharply criticizing the perpetrators and calling Boko Haram "one of the worst regional or local terrorist organizations ... in Nigeria." However, Boko Haram's actions have caused other extrinsic problems as well. In March Amnesty International released a report finding that some responses by Nigerian security forces to attacks by Boko Haram have themselves been <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/ai-both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-nigeria-conflict.php">in conflict with human rights standards</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March former UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-chief-urges-nigeria-to-further-human-rights-protections.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Nigerian government to focus on protecting human rights and not to "exacerbate" violence in its response to attacks by Boko Haram. In August of 2013 the International Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/icc-prosecutor-reports-boko-haram-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-in-nigeria.php">expressed its finding </a>[JURIST report] that there existed a "reasonable basis" to believe that Boko Haram was guilty of crimes against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Delaware Governor <a href="http://governor.delaware.gov/">Jack Markell</a> [official website] on Thursday signed into law <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/LIS148.NSF/93487d394bc01014882569a4007a4cb7/09e5fedf77f8ae2185257dd50067f79f?OpenDocument">House Bill 39</a> [materials], a measure that decriminalizes the possession and use of small amounts of marijuana. The bill, which was <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/story/firststatepolitics/2015/06/18/senate-debate-marijuana/28927757/">given final legislative approval</a> [<em>Delaware Online</em> report] by the state's senate Thursday and signed by the governor quickly after, will allow people in Delaware to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and use it privately without facing criminal sanctions. Police may still confiscate the drugs, however. The penalty for marijuana use in a public place is reduced to a $100 civil fine under the law. Selling marijuana will remain a criminal offense. Prior to this new legislation, simple marijuana possession in Delaware was a misdemeanor for which one <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/19/us-usa-marijuana-delaware-idUSKBN0OZ0BE20150619">could be sentenced</a> [Reuters report] to up to six months in jail and as much as a $1,150 fine. Governor spokesperson Kelly Bachman in a statement on the signing said, "The governor remains committed to reducing the number of people entering the criminal justice system and refocusing resources where they are needed most and House Bill 39 supports these efforts." The law will take effect in six months. </p>

<p>Delaware joins 19 other states and the District of Columbia in no longer charging its citizens criminally for possessing marijuana in small amounts. The<a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/"> legalization of medical marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has also gained support in recent years. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, creating conflicts. Earlier this week the Colorado Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/colorado-high-court-upholds-employee-termination-for-medical-marijuana-use.php">affirmed </a>[JURIST report] a lower court decision that employers' zero tolerance drug policies are not preempted by Colorado's legalization of medical marijuana. The court in its opinion emphasized that "employees who engage in an activity, such as medical marijuana use, that is permitted by state law but unlawful under federal law are not protected by the [state's lawful off duty activities] statute." In early March a bipartisan group of three US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/senators-introduce-bill-to-lift-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would loosen governmental regulation, and notably, allow states to enact their own medical marijuana statutes without federal interference. A few days later, an identical companion bill was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/medical-marijuana-bill-introduced-in-us-house.php">introduced </a>[JURIST report] in the US House of Representatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8733">addressed the challenges </a>[statement] of upholding the fundamental rights of children in war zones, stating that protecting children is a "moral imperative and legal obligation." The Secretary-General spoke on the issue during an open debate on children and armed conflict which addressed the issue of increasing mass child abductions. Ban said that grave violations against children constitute "an affront to our common humanity" in the Central African Republic, Iraq, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic. He also expressed deep alarm at the suffering of many children a a result of Israeli military operations in Gaza last year, urging Israel to take firm and immediate steps to protect and prevent the killing and maiming of children. In focusing on child abduction, Ban stated, "Abduction is now being used as a tactic to terrorize or target particular ethnic groups or religious communities, and children have been a particular focus." He called on Member States to "pursue all avenues" to protect children impacted by armed conflict, saying that children have the right to be protected in their schools, homes and communities. </p>

<p>The UN has repeatedly expressed concern for the treatment of children in conflict areas over the years. In  February the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-islamic-state-committing-rights-abuses-against-children-in-iraq.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that members of the Islamic State (IS) are abducting Iraqi children and engaging in serious human rights abuses. In December the UN Children's Fund <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/unicef-2014-a-devastating-year-for-children.php">issued a press release</a> [JURIST report] declaring 2014 "a devastating year for children," citing the 15 million children affected by violent conflicts in the Central Africal Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, Palestine, Syria and Ukraine. In July a UN issued report <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-human-rights-abuses-against-children-continuing-with-impunity.php">said </a>[JURIST report] that children continued to be victims of violence and military recruitment in 23 conflict zones around the world in 2013, with Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict Leila Zerrougui calling Syria "one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child." Last June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/hrw-syria-armed-groups-using-child-soldiers.php">claimed </a>[JURIST report] that teenagers as young as 15 have been recruited by armed groups in Syria with some becoming suicide bombers. Earlier that month the International Criminal Court (ICC) confirmed war crimes charges against Congolese general Bosco Ntanga including the recruitment of child soldiers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) [official website] <a href="http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx">downgraded</a> [official report] the security rating of Thailand's aviation sector from Category 1 to Category 2 on Thursday. The agency clarified that the designation as a "significant safety concern (SSC) does not necessarily indicate a particular safety deficiency in the air navigation service providers, airlines (air operators), aircraft or aerodrome; but, rather, indicates that the State is not providing sufficient safety oversight to ensure the effective implementation of applicable ICAO Standards." The ICAO warned Thailand in March that the safety regulations were not up to the agency's standards, however, Thailand failed to make the necessary improvements within 90 days. Other countries joined Thailand in the red flag category including Nepal and Sierra Leone. Thai Airways <a href="http://social.thaiairways.com/2015/06/thai-maintains-highest-safety-standards/">responded</a> [press release] to the security downgrade and stated that despite the safety audit on Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation the airline maintains the highest safety protocols. </p>

<p>Thailand has undergone political turmoil since the military coup last May when the country's armed forces <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-armed-forces-impose-martial-law.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on a military run television station, citing Thailand's martial law act of 1914 as the basis for the military's action. Just two days later, Chan-ocha announced that the military had seized control of the country and <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">suspended its constitution</a> [JURIST report]. In July Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/thailand-king-endorses-interim-constitution.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] for the interim constitution even though the international community expressed concern. In April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-concerned-by-thailand-governments-new-security-order.php">expressed alarm</a> [JURIST report] by Thailand's decision to suspend martial law and impose Article 44 of the interim constitution. The order permits Chan-ocha to issue any legislative, executive or judicial order, and according to Zeid, the order may annihilate freedom of expression and allow violations of human rights to be free from liability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New records <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/06/17/17491/audit-feds-overpaid-half-patients-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-plan">released</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/">Center for Public Integrity</a> (CPI) [official website] Wednesday revealed a confidential legal battle over Medicare over-billing that spanned three years between government officials and <a href="http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/">UnitedHealth Group</a> [official website]. The dispute centered on a 2012 audit obtained through the <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> [official website] that revealed UnitedHealth charged too much for Medicare Advantage plans in nearly half of a sample of 201 patients enrolled at PacifiCare of Washington state, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Although the insurer has failed to comment on the new information, it has argued that the "audit was unfair and the results were flat out wrong." The <a href="http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'</a> (CMS) [official website] audit used the patients' medical information and billing documents from UnitedHealth and compared the Medicare cost to the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/06/04/14865/how-risk-scores-work">risk score</a> [CPI backgrounder] attributed to their degree of health and determined the amount of over-billing to be $381,776. CPI also revealed information obtained from a 2011 CMS presentation that estimated Medicare payment errors amounted to $13.5 billion in 2010, however, a final payment recovery strategy has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Comprehensive <a href="/feature/2013/07/health-care-reform-1.php">health care reform</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was passed by Congress in March 2010 after over a year of congressional debate. The <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF] was aimed at both reforming the private health insurance market and ensuring greater access to health insurance coverage. However, since the bill was signed into law it has been the subject of numerous federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. Most of these lawsuits have revolved around the law's individual mandate provisions--which requires that all non-exempt US citizens obtain minimum health insurance coverage. In January the Obama Administration <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/obama-threatens-to-veto-proposed-health-care-changes.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the president would veto proposed legislation that would reinstate the 40-hour work week requirement for employer health care coverage. In March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in King v. Burwell to determine whether the IRS may adopt regulations to extend tax-credit subsidies to coverage purchased through the federal health insurance exchange.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51185#.VYbKxGCprzJ">warned</a> [UN Report] of the record high number of refugees around the world as a result of increasing global conflicts. According to data collected by the UNHCR in 2014 the number of refugees grew from roughly 51 million in 2013 to 60 million in 2014. The data suggests that 1 in every 122 persons is displaced throughout the world. In a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/print/558193896.html">press release</a> [press release] earlier in the week UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres stated "It is terrifying that on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those starting conflicts, and on the other there is seeming utter inability of the international community to work together to stop wars and build and preserve peace." The report also details that over half the worlds refugees are children. Mr. Guterres also stated "with huge shortages of funding and wide gaps in the global regime for protecting victims of war, people in need of compassion, aid and refuge are being abandoned."

<p>The world is facing its <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/amnesty-urges-world-leaders-to-act-on-refugee-crisis.php">worst refugee crisis since World War II</a> [JURIST report]. Refugees from the conflicts in Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration issued a joint statement calling on the EU to create a new<a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php"> rescue operation program</a> [JURIST report] for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2015/bills/senate/433">bill</a> [text] approved by Indiana lawmakers earlier this year repealing the statewide ban on sawed-off shotguns will go into effect July 1. The bill, sponsored by Senator <a href="http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/index.php?src=directory&view=senators&srctype=detail&refno=52&category=General">Jim Tomes</a> [official profile], will allow the manufacture, selling and ownership of shotguns with barrels 18 inches or less in length. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/sawed-off-shotguns-legal-indiana-starting-july-31885066">According to</a> [AP report] Senator Tomes the law will put the state's gun control policies on par with federal regulations, which state that a person is allowed to own short-barreled shotguns if they pass background checks for permits from the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/">Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> [official website]. However, the gun must be manufactured with a short barrel, as it is still illegal to modify a shotgun's barrel to less than the minimum length. Generally sawed-off shotguns are very expensive and typically only purchased by gun collectors.</p>

<p>Gun control has been the center of national attention since the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596">Newtown, Connecticut, shooting</a> [WSJ report] in December 2012. Earlier this month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-declines-to-review-case-challenging-california-gun-law.php">denied certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-704.htm">Jackson v. San Francisco</a> [docket; cert. petition, PDF], a case challenging a San Francisco law requiring gun owners to keep handguns "stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock that has been approved by the California Department of Justice." In April Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-firearm-possession-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun should be considered a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). In January Michigan Governor Rick Snyder <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/michigan-govenor-veteos-gun-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] gun legislation supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and approved by both chambers of the Republican-controlled state legislation. Also in January the NRA <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/nra-sues-3-pennsylvania-cities-over-local-gun-ordinances.php">sued the City of Pittsburgh</a> [JURIST report] in January alleging a local gun ordinance violated Pennsylvania state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-1 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/horne-v-department-of-agriculture-2">Horne v. Department of Agriculture</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a program requiring California raisin growers to hand over a percentage of their harvest to the government violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/takings">takings clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the Fifth Amendment. Under regulations citing the <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5067868">Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937</a> [text, PDF], the government ordered growers to set aside the crops for government use in an effort to stabilize raisin prices. If there was a monetary surplus from the program, the government would pay farmers for the raisins, but less than the market value. The government had argued that because the raisins were personal property rather than real estate, and because the farmers received some form of consideration, the program did not violate the takings clause. The court disagreed, ordering the government to pay market price for crops set aside in this way, and waiving penalties the government had imposed on growers who had not cooperated. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the program did constitute a taking, had not been agreed to by virtue of the farmers participating in the raisin market, and that<blockquote>Nothing in the text or history of the Takings Clause, or our precedents, suggests that the rule is any different when it comes to appropriation of personal property. The Government has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.</blockquote>The ruling reversed an earlier <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/05/09/10-15270.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in January and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-california-raisings-takings-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April. It follows an earlier case in which the court also <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-in-california-raisins-takings-case.php">found in favor</a> [JURIST report] of the growers over the issue of whether the Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-6368_m6hn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kingsley-v-hendrickson/">Kingsley v. Hendrickson</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that force used against pre-trial detainees must be "objectively reasonable," the same standard used outside of prisons. The plaintiff in the case brought an excessive force claim against the government under the Fourteenth Amendment's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process clause</a> [LII backgrounder] and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">42 USC §1983</a> [text]. The government had argued that the standard should be subjective: whether an officer used more force than they believed was necessary, and cited Eighth Amendment <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/cruel_and_unusual_punishment">cruel and unusual punishment</a> [LII backgrounder] precedence involving inmates already convicted of a crime. Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer rejected both the subjective standard and the application of the Eighth Amendment reasoning, but left the question of whether the objective standard also applied to convicted inmates open: <blockquote>We acknowledge that our view that an objective standard is appropriate in the context of excessive force claims brought by pretrial detainees pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment may raise questions about the use of a subjective standard in the context of excessive force claims brought by convicted prisoners. We are not confronted with such a claim, however, so we need not address that issue today.</blockquote> The decision vacated an earlier <a href="http://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/12-3639/12-3639-2014-03-03.pdf?ts=1411045255">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] the <a href="https://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a>, and remanded the case for the court to determine whether jury instructions given were harmless despite their failure to comply with an objective standard.</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito also filed a dissent. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in January and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-excessive-force-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1175_2qe4.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/city-of-los-angeles-v-patel/">City of Los Angeles v. Patel</a> [opinion, PDF] that police must obtain a search warrant before demanding to inspect a hotel's guest list. At issue was a Los Angeles <a href="http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2006/06-0125-s1_ord_179533.pdf">law</a> [Los Angeles Municipal Code § 41.49, PDF] requiring hotels to keep specific records on guests and make them immediately available to police on request, or else face criminal charges. The city had argued that the law could not be challenged facially - based on its text alone, without a specific example of its application. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor disagreed, saying the bare text of the law alone violated Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag2_user.html#amdt4_hd14">search and seizure</a> [LII backgrounder], because it gave hotel operators no chance to challenge the search before complying with it. Sotomayor went on to say that the city could continue to require the records to be kept and that existing doctrines already protected law enforcement's interests: <blockquote>nothing in our decision today precludes an officer from conducting a surprise inspection by obtaining an ex parte warrant or, where an officer reasonably suspects the registry would be altered, from guarding the registry pending a hearing on a motion to quash.</blockquote>The ruling upheld an earlier <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/12/24/08-56567.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito also filed a dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-to-rule-on-hotel-guest-registries.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to the case in October and heard oral arguments in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8754">announced</a> [press release] the appointment of an independent panel to review the organization's handling of allegations that French and African soldiers sexually abused children in the Central African Republic from December 2013 to June 2014. The panel will be led by <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/judges-juges/bio-eng.aspx?id=marie-deschamps">Marie Deschamps</a> [official profile], a former justice on the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website], and will include <a href="http://spp.ceu.edu/people/yasmin-louise-sooka">Yasmin Sooka</a> [official profile], executive director of the <a href="http://www.fhr.org.za/">Foundation of Human Rights in South Africa</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/en/tribunal/office-prosecutor/prosecutor">Hassan Jallow</a> [official profile] of Gambia, a prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">UN tribunal for Rwanda</a> [official website]. The sexual abuse was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/29/un-aid-worker-suspended-leaking-report-child-abuse-french-troops-car">first reported</a> [Guardian report] in April at the conclusion of a UN investigation into at least 14 French soldiers who allegedly forced children to perform sexual acts in exchange for food. The panel will begin investigations next month and aim to report on their findings in around 10 weeks. </p>

<p>The UN has repeatedly expressed concern for the treatment of children in conflict areas over the years. Last week, the UN Secretary-General <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-sg-children-in-war-zones-must-be-protected.php">addressed the challenges</a> [JURIST report] of upholding the fundamental rights of children in war zones, stating that protecting children is a "moral imperative and legal obligation." In February the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-islamic-state-committing-rights-abuses-against-children-in-iraq.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that members of the Islamic State are abducting Iraqi children and engaging in serious human rights abuses. In December the UN Children's Fund <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/unicef-2014-a-devastating-year-for-children.php">issued a press release</a> [JURIST report] declaring 2014 "a devastating year for children," citing the 15 million children affected by violent conflicts in the Central Africal Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, Palestine, Syria and Ukraine. In July a UN issued report <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-human-rights-abuses-against-children-continuing-with-impunity.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that children continued to be victims of violence and military recruitment in 23 conflict zones around the world in 2013, with Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict Leila Zerrougui calling Syria "one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child." Last June Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/hrw-syria-armed-groups-using-child-soldiers.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that teenagers as young as 15 have been recruited by armed groups in Syria with some becoming suicide bombers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoIGaza/A-HRC-29-52_en.doc">report</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx#report">materials</a>] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/CommissionOfInquiry.aspx">UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict</a> [official website] found that both Israel and Hamas may have committed war crimes during the conflict. The 51 day <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28252155">Gaza Conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder] resulted in widespread destruction and over a thousand dead. The report notes that the majority of the destruction, as well as 1,462 Palestinian civilian deaths, were a direct result of Israeli military action, most notably, the use of airstrikes and weaponry with a wide-kill radius in densely populated areas where civilian casualties were almost a certainty. The report also finds that the Palestinian response of rockets and mortars resulted in six deaths and over a thousand injuries. In her concluding remarks, committee chair <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2014/08/25/un-names-mary-mcgowan-davis-to-schabas-commission-on-gaza/">McGowan Davis</a> [UN Watch report] emphasized the need for both sides to hold their wrongdoers accountable as a way of preventing similar future conflicts.</p>

<p>The Israel-Palestine conflict continues to be a significant international legal issue. Earlier this month an international group of high-ranking military officials and diplomats <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-watch-military-group-finds-israel-acted-defensively-reasonably-in-gaza-conflict.php">issued its own report</a> [JURIST report], finding that Israel met or exceeded international standards during the conflict. In April the <a href="http://www.idf.il/english/">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] ordered a female Palestinian legislative council member to serve a six-month <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/israel-authorities-order-detention-of-palestine-lawmaker.php">detention without trial</a> [JURIST report] under a system meant to protect from attacks from militants. Later that month, a UN independent board of inquiry uncovered <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-israel-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-in-gaza.php">evidence</a> [JURIST report] that at least 44 Palestinians were killed and 227 injured by "Israeli action" during the Gaza conflict of 2014. In May, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] condemned Hamas for <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/amnesty-condemns-human-rights-abuses-by-hamas-forces.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], accusing the group of leading a series of abductions, torturous acts and unlawful killings against Palestinians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-720_jiel.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-3 in <a href="ttp://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kimble-v-marvel-enterprises-inc">Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment</a> [text, PDF] that patent holders still cannot charge royalties after the expiration of a patent. The decision, written by Justice <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Elena Kagan</a> [offical profile], reaffirmed the court's holding in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/29/case.html">Brulotte v. Thys</a> [opinion]. The petitioner in the case had argued that the reasoning of the earlier case was flawed because it unjustifiably limited the kind of contracts parties could engage in. The court disagreed, setting a high bar for overruling precedent and saying parties could achieve similar ends with different means:<blockquote>To start, <u>Brulotte</u> allows a licensee to defer payments for pre-expiration use of a patent into the post-expiration period; all the decision bars are royalties for using an invention after it has moved into the public domain.... A licensee could agree, for example, to pay the licensor a sum equal to 10% of sales during the 20-year patent term, but to amortize that amount over 40 years.</blockquote>The court noted that the legislature has had several opportunities to reverse <u>Brulotte</u> but has repeatedly failed to do so. There also have not been any significant legal developments in patent law that would seemingly justify a reversal and ultimately the court found no reason to "unsettle stable law."  <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Justices Alito and Thomas</a> [official profiles] dissented stating that the reasoning espoused in <u>Brulotte</u> "was not based on anything that can plausibly be regarded as an interpretation of the terms of the Patent Act. It was based instead on an economic theory&#8212;and one that has been debunked." </p>

<p>The patented object in this case was a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-patent-disputes.php">Spider-Man toy </a>[JURIST report] which allowed an individual to shoot foam string from the toy in a way that the Marvel character might have shot his web. Petitioner Stephen Kimble received the patent in 1990 and subsequently met with the president of Marvel's predecessor. Marvel then began to make a toy named the "Web Blaster" which bore significant similarity to Kimble's product. He filed suit in 1997 alleging patent infringement but the parties later settled agreeing that in exchange for a lump sum of approximately $500,000 USD and 3% percent royalty on Marvel's profits from the "Web Blaster", Kimble would end the litigation. No date was set by the parties as to the official end of the royalty agreement and in 2010, when Kimble's patent expired, Marvel alleged that they no longer owed him the 3% royalty following the precedent in <u>Brulotte</u> and refused to pay him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cescr/pages/cescrindex.aspx">Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [official website] on Monday released a <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CESCR/Shared%20Documents/IRL/INT_CESCR_COC_IRL_20930_E.docx">report</a> [text, DOC] calling on Ireland to "take all necessary steps, including a referendum on abortion, to revise its legislation on abortion." The committee expressed grave concern over Ireland's criminalization of abortion even in cases of rape, and it believed that its recommendations would help align Ireland's abortion policies with international human rights standards. The committee also recommended that Ireland revise its constitution and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2013/en.act.2013.0035.pdf">2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act</a> [text, PDF]  in order to help achieve this goal. The committee further called for Ireland take steps to make provisions of its constitution more "gender-equal", increase women's representation in decision-making positions, and close the gender pay gap.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Abortion</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a continuing controversial topic in both Ireland and the neighboring state of Northern Ireland. Earlier this month <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said Ireland's abortion laws <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/amnesty-condemns-irelands-restrictive-abortion-law.php">threaten the lives</a> [JURIST report] of women who choose to remain in the country. In December the High Court of Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/ireland-high-court-rules-pregant-woman-may-be-removed-from-life-support.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a pregnant woman may be removed from life support, concluding that the life of an unborn child must be prioritized. Also that month the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) announced that it <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/rights-group-challenges-northern-ireland-abortion-law.php">planned to file a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the region's law against abortions. Northern Ireland's current abortion law was proposed shortly after the 2013 death of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion. Following her death, Ireland's <a href="http://www.gilmore.ie">Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ireland-deputy-pm-promises-to-clarify-abortion-laws-following-death.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring "legal clarity" to the country's abortion laws. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of North Korea on Tuesday sentenced two South Korean men to indefinite labor on subversion charges, according to the <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm">Korean Central News Agency</a> [official news website] of North Korea. Kim Kuk Gi and Choe Chun Gil were found guilty of spying for South Korea's <a href="http://eng.nis.go.kr/svc/index.do">National Intelligence Service</a> (NIS) [official website]. They were <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/23/c_134349676.htm">further convicted</a> [Xinhua report] of conspiracy to overturn the state, illegal entry, and working under the control of the US government. It is thought unlikely that the men will eventually be released, as North and South Korea technically remain in a state of war.</p>

<p>In April, North Korean leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/reports-north-korea-leader-sentenced-15-officials-to-death-in-2015.php">ordered the execution</a> [JURIST report] of fifteen state officials. In November UN Special Rapporteur on the situation in the People's Republic of Korea Marzuki Darusman said that there is enough evidence to hold North Korean leader Kim responsible for <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-expert-enough-evidence-to-hold-north-korea-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">"massive" human rights atrocities</a> [JURIST report] committed in the country. Also in November the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-general-assembly-north-korea-should-be-referred-to-icc.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Security Council to call on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] to investigate the crimes. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-rights-body-calls-for-justice-in-north-korea.php#.U1EvqFcS-Ca">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] last March urging the UN Security Council to take action against those responsible for documented crimes against humanity in North Korea. Last February then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that there <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-urges-action-in-north-korea.php#.U1Ev_FcS-CY">can no longer be any excuses for inaction</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea following the release of a UN report. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062215zor_2bo2.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-916.htm">Kingdomware Technologies v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015.01.29-Kingdomware-Petition-for-a-Writ-of-Certiorari_ActiveUS140595038ActiveUS1.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case that deals with the rights of small-business-owning veterans to receive benefits from the <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official website]. In 2006, Congress passed a bill that states the VA "shall" award contracts to veteran-owned small businesses if at least two such businesses bid on the work at a fair price. The question before the court is if the term "shall," as used in the legislation, requires the VA to award the contracts to the veteran-owned business, or if that decision is discretionary. <a href="https://www.kingdomware.net/">Kingdomware</a> [official website], an information technology firm owned by service-disabled Army veteran Timothy Barton, argues that the VA has an obligation to seek veteran-owned businesses, while the VA rebuts that it need only consider them in the scope of what is best to achieve its business goals. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in favor of the VA, stating that the <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=browsefar">Federal Acquisition Regulation</a> [text], the general procedures for government contracting, permit agencies significant leeway in deciding how best to allocate business resources. Argument has not yet been scheduled. </p>

<p>In an opinion written by Judge Nancy Firestone, the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/FIRESTONE.KINGDOMWARE112712.pdf">ruled </a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the United States in 2012. On appeal, Kingdomware challenged the ruling on the meaning of the term "shall" in statutory construction. In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KingdomwareFC.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the United States in an opinion written by Raymond C. Clevenger. Kingdomware petitioned for cert in January of this year. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> on the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/14-00916qp.pdf">question</a> [question, PDF], "Whether the Federal Circuit erred in construing 38 U.S.C. § 8127(d)'s mandatory set-aside restricting competition for Department of Veterans Affairs' contracts to veteran-owned small businesses as discretionary."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ptun-jakarta.go.id">State Administrative Court of Jakarta</a> [official website, in Indonesian] on Monday denied the clemency appeal of a French citizen sentenced to death on a drug trafficking charge. The appeal of Serge Atlaoui was an effort to reverse the original clemency denial made by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28422179">President Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] last year. The country has received significant criticism for its use of the death penalty for drug offenses, particularly against foreign nationals. In its opinion, the Jakarta court said that granting clemency was the exclusive prerogative of the president. France, which firmly opposes the death penalty, has aimed to <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2015/06/22/indonesie-la-justice-rejette-le-recours-de-serge-atlaoui_4658793_3210.html">provide aid</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French] to Atlaoui and has warned of "consequences" should the execution be completed. </p>

<p>Indonesia's use of the death penalty has been an international point of contention, with several members of the international community speaking out against the practice. In April, Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indonesia-executes-8-convicted-drug-smugglers.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] eight convicted drug smugglers said to be part of the "Bali Nine" smuggling ring by firing squad. In February a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. In January another spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The OHCHR reported that eight more people convicted of drug trafficking in Vietnam had been sentenced to death. Also in January Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> [JURIST report] their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/ColSyria/A-HRC-29.CRP.3.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] Tuesday stating that both government troops and opposition rebels are targeting civilians in Syria's civil war.The report says that the government intentionally targets areas in which civilians regularly congregate, such as marketplaces and bus stations and that it has failed to take reasonable precautions to minimize "incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects." It found that hospitals and historic monuments are regularly targeted as well, violating the special protection afforded to these facilities by modern international humanitarian law. The report cites new intelligence that chemical weapons were used in two attacks in March and April 2015. The report concludes by saying:<blockquote>The Syrian people deserve an unambiguous commitment to helping them to return their country to peace. Influential states must make their continued political support conditional on parties&#8217; willingness to compromise and negotiate. To create conditions amenable to negotiations is a shared responsibility. This cannot be achieved without the setting aside of the narrow national interests of a few and the coming together of a community which holds within itself not only the ideals of human rights, but also a deepening realization that, without peace and justice in Syria, all the world will suffer the consequences.</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war based around the legitimacy of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC reports]. In August the UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-reports-191000-dead-in-syria-conflict.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that 191,000 have died in the conflict, and that number continues to climb. Last June the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-body-warned-syria-conflict-threatens-whole-region.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the UN Human Rights Council that the continuing civil war in Syria conflict has "reached a tipping point, threatening the entire region." Last May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch </a>[advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/hrw-cites-evidence-syria-used-chemical-weapons.php">cited evidence</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons on its own citizens. Last March a panel of UN human rights experts presented a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-syria-rebels-committed-mass-executions-of-civilians.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that depicted the Syrian rebel practice of "execution fields" where mass killings were committed through the use of barrel bomb attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner on Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/FR/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16127&LangID=E">announced</a> [statement] Tuesday the opening of a UN office to specifically monitor human rights in North Korea (DPRK). The <a href="http://seoul.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/HOME.aspx">UN Human Rights Office (Seoul)</a> [official website] will be located in Seoul, South Korea. It is tasked with outreach, technical cooperation with member states, monitoring human rights violations, and making efforts towards human rights change in DPRK. On the opening, Al Hussein said: <blockquote>The Seoul office will monitor and document [violations] in the DPRK, building on the landmark work of the Commission of Inquiry and Special Rapporteur. We firmly believe this will help lay the basis for future accountability.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The decision to open the new UN office in Seoul follows the release of a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/ReportoftheCommissionofInquiryDPRK.aspx">report</a> [materials] in February of 2014 by the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, which detailed numerous and "unspeakable" atrocities committed against the country's people and states that country's situation is worse than that of any other in "duration, intensity and horror." Later in February 2014, then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-urges-action-in-north-korea.php#.U1Ev_FcS-CY">stated</a> [JURIST report] that there can no longer be any excuses for inaction in North Korea. In November 2014 the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation in the DPRK Marzuki Darusman <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-expert-accountablity-for-abuses-in-north-korea-paramount.php">recognized</a> [JURIST report] that the issue of accountability of those responsible for crimes against humanity in the country remained at the top of the agenda. Also in November, the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-general-assembly-north-korea-should-be-referred-to-icc.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Security Council to call on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate allegations against North Korea for crimes against humanity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China's anti-corruption <a href="http://www.12388.gov.cn/">Central Commission for Discipline Inspection</a> (CCDI) [official website, in Chinese] on Tuesday announced the launch of investigations into 26 government agencies and state-owned-enterprises (SOEs). The entities to be investigated include <a href="http://en.people.cn/">People's Daily Newspaper</a> [media website], Anshan Iron and Steel, conglomerate China Resources, the Ministry of Transport and National Railway Administration. In the <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/24/c_134349936.htm">announcement</a> [Xinhua report], the CCDI said the investigations were designed to combat widespread lax enforcement of anti-graft policies in the agencies and SOEs, saying that entities controlled by the Communist Party of China should be held to the highest standards of ethics.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform its judicial system and combat corruption. The CCDI inspections have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/23/us-china-corruption-idUSKBN0P313T20150623">resulted</a> [Reuters report] in lost positions by 70 senior officials of state firms in 2014. Earlier this month China's ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang was <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/china-ex-security-chief-sentenced-to-life-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to life imprisonment for corruption, after being found guilty of bribery, abuse of power and intentionally disclosing national secrets. In March officials announced that efforts against corruption have<a href="/paperchase/2015/03/china-implicates-14-generals-in-anti-corruption-campaign.php"> led to the investigation and conviction of 14 generals</a> [JURIST report] for corrupt financial practices. In February Chinese officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/china-to-prosecute-top-parliamentary-official-for-graft.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the impending prosecution of Su Rong, former vice chairman of China's top parliamentary advisory board, for graft. In July China's former Communist Party leader Bo Xilai was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-communist-party-leader-formally-charged-with-corruption.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] with corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power. In March 2012 the President and Chief Justice of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) told the National People's Congress (NPC) that the country must continue to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-chief-judge-urges-courts-to-continue-legal-reforms.php">implement legal reform</a> [JURIST report] to combat corruption and foster social and economic growth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London's <a href="http://content.met.police.uk/Home">Metropolitan Police</a> [official website] announced Tuesday that it has arrested Rwanda National Intelligence and Security Services head Karenzi Karake on an international warrant for war crimes. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/recognition-decision/european-arrest-warrant/index_en.htm">European Arrest Warrant</a> [materials] was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/02/spain-judge-indicts-40-rwanda-military.php">issued in 2008</a> [JURIST report] by Spanish High Court Judge Fernando Andreu for Karake's <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/06/22/actualidad/1434996635_589844.html">alleged role</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] in the 1997 killings of three Spanish aid workers. The Rwandan government has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33238670">strongly criticized</a> [BBC report] the arrest. UK authorities have not yet said whether they will extradite Karake to Spain to stand trial, but have set a hearing for June 25.</p>

<p>Spain's assertion of jurisdiction for crimes that occur outside its boarders has long been controversial. In February 2014, the country's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/spain-parliament-approves-proposal-to-curb-universal-jurisdiction-powers.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to limit its use of so-called "universal jurisdiction." In October 2013, a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/china-denounces-spain-courts-indictment-of-former-president.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] former Chinese president Hu Jintao over the alleged genocide against Tibetans. Also in October, the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/us-ambassador-called-to-spain-regarding-spying-allegations.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] US Ambassador to Spain James Costos to discuss spying allegations in light of documents released by former <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=edward+snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April 2011, the Spanish National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-court-turns-over-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-US.php">agreed to turn over</a> [JURIST report] to the US an investigation of torture claims at Guantanamo Bay, after increased pressure from the US. In 2009, the Spanish Congress <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limited the country's universal jurisdiction statute</a> [JURIST report]. Unlike the recent bill, the 2009 law only applied prospectively, allowing any on-going investigations to proceed, including investigations of <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-to-investigate-israeli-role.php">Israeli actions in Gaza in 2002</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay</a> and allegations of war crimes and genocide in  Rwanda, <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/spain-high-court-to-rule-on-tibetan.php">Tibet</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/spain-court-to-try-guatemala-genocide.php">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/spain-court-to-hear-suit-against-china.php">China</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human rights groups <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/"> American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] on Tuesday issued a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-aclu-and-human-rights-watch-urge-doj-to-appoint-special-prosecutor-for-torture">joint letter</a> [text] to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) calling for the creation of a special prosecutor to investigate claims that Central Intelligence Agency agents used torture against detainees held at Guantanamo Bay prison and elsewhere. The groups said that the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf">executive summary</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">report</a>] of a US Senate investigation into the matter justified further action, and expressed disappointment that the DOJ had not continued the investigation after the report's release:<blockquote>the necessity of investigating issues of criminal liability is made more urgent by the fact that many of the individuals who authorized the conduct documented in the Senate torture report are publicly defending the necessity, effectiveness, and legality of that conduct. Against this background, we believe the failure to conduct a comprehensive criminal investigation would contribute to the notion that torture remains a permissible policy option for future administrations; undermine the ability of the United States to advocate for human rights abroad; and compromise Americans&#8217; faith in the rule of law at home.</blockquote>The groups later issued a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-statement-un-human-rights-council-demanding-accountability-cia-torture-program?redirect=coalition-letter-un-human-rights-council-demanding-accountability-cia-torture-program">similar statement</a> [text] to the UN Human Right Council.</p>

<p>The CIA has been <a href="/feature/2015/01/torture-report-international-response.php">continually accused</a> [JURIST feature] of torturing terrorist suspects since the attacks on September 11, 2001. Earlier this month, a former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-wider-use-of-torture-by-cia.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that abuses went beyond those detailed in the Senate report. In December the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights</a> [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-expert-urges-prosecution-of-us-officials-responsible-for-torture.php">prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of CIA and other government officials for the interrogation and torture of detainees. That same month the so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed during the Bush administration were deemed to be <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">ineffective</a> [JURIST report], according to the long-awaited Senate Intelligence Committee Report. Last September it was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/cia-used-extreme-torture-methods-on-terrorist-suspects-report.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the CIA used torture methods beyond waterboarding on suspected terrorists, according to a report published by the <em>Telegraph</em>. In late August 10 victims of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">CIA's extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive] signed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/cia-rendition-victims-urge-obama-to-name-them-in-senate-report.php">open letter</a> [JURIST report] to US President Barack Obama urging him to declassify the upcoming Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Tuesday ruled in favor of tight regulations pointed at the for-profit college industry. The court ruled that the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education Department</a> [official website] has the right to demand that schools show that their graduates are financially dependent enough to repay their student loans. Fraudulent colleges have been the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/23/federal-court-for-profit-colleges_n_7649482.html">subject of scrutiny</a> [AP report] by the department for over a year now as they seek to limit the ability of these institutions to target low-income students and receive federal student loans and grants in the process. After the new rules go into effect on July 1, a college program will be required to show that the estimated annual loan payment of a standard graduate does not exceed 20 percent of his or her discretionary income or 8 percent of their total earnings. Programs that fail to pass the new standards will be at risk for losing access to federal funding. The <a href="http://www.career.org/">Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities</a> (APSCU) [official website] unsuccessfully sued to prevent the rules from taking effect. The APSCU, a trade group that represents roughly 1,400 for-profit colleges, argued that the regulations were at odds with existing law.</p>

<p>Legislation involving for-profit college education and education in general has generated controversy within the US the past few years. In August 2014 a judge for a Travis County Civil Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/texas-judge-rules-education-budget-cuts-unconstitutional.php">in Texas ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Texas legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty to provide for Texas public schools because the school finance system is structured, operated, and funded so that it cannot provide a constitutionally reasonable education for all Texas schoolchildren. Also last August education advocacy groups in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/new-york-advocacy-groups-challenge-teacher-tenure.php">challenged the state's teacher tenure laws</a> [JURIST report], claiming that laws protecting teacher employment violate the civil rights of children to a quality education. Last June a judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/alifornia-court-strikes-down-teacher-tenure-system.php">ruled that</a>  [JURIST report] California's system for tenure and seniority for public school teachers is unconstitutional. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Wisconsin Governor <a href="http://walker.wi.gov">Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/related/proposals/sb35">signed two bills</a> [Senate Bill 35 PDF; <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/proposaltext/2015/REG/AB49">Senate Bill 49</a> PDF] Wednesday loosening Wisconsin's gun laws. The bills, to take effect on Friday, eliminate Wisconsin's 48-hour waiting period for purchasing a handgun and allow off duty, retired and out-of-state police officers to carry firearms on school grounds. Both the content and timing of the bills <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/us-usa-guns-wisconsin-idUSKBN0P42HH20150624">have been criticized</a> [Reuters report], coming a week after a mass shooting in a black church by a white gunman in South Carolina. But Walker defended the bills, saying the shootings occurred because of racism, not access to guns.</p>

<p>Gun control has a prominent topic in US politics since a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012. Last December the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-gun-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting individuals who have been committed to a mental institution for any amount of time from possessing a firearm is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. This court was the first to strike down a federal gun law under the Second Amendment since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] effectively <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_290">struck down</a> [opinion] Washington, DC's ban on firearm ownership six years ago. However, mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut and elsewhere have spurred some state legislatures to create and adopt gun control laws. In August 2014 a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of Maryland</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-upholds-critical-provisions-of-maryland-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] portions of Maryland's gun control law, which banned certain types of "assault weapons" and a limited gun magazines to 10 rounds, explaining that the law served a legitimate government interest of ensuring public safety. In June of that year a judge for the <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/federal-judge-upholds-colorado-gun-control-laws.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] two Colorado statutes that expanded mandatory background checks and banned high capacity magazines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Australian parliament on Monday passed the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Copyright_Bill_2015">Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015</a> [official website] to prevent the online piracy of film and TV shows. The approved legislation <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/laws-targeting-illegal-downloads-from-overseas-websites-pass-senate">gives rights holders</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the chance to go to a federal judge and get overseas websites that have the "primary purpose" of creating copyright infringement issues blocked. Australian internet providers will be forced to follow a judge's order in disabling access to the infringing location should a rights holder succeed in their blocking request. Proponents of the law have said it will protect rights holders, but opponents say it will do to much to restrict legitimate uses of the Internet.</p>

<p>Many countries have had difficulty in recent years with figuring out how best to resolve internet piracy issues. In June 2013 a new anti-piracy bill allowing websites to be blocked by internet service providers (ISPs) upon copyright infringement claims <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/russia-parliament-approves-internet-piracy-bill.php">passed through</a> [JURIST report] its final two readings in Russia's State Duma. In 2012 the Spanish government approved the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">approved a new law</a> [JURIST report] that created a government agency with the authority to force ISPs to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyright materials. In 2011, the Somali parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/somalia-parliament-rejects-anti-piracy-legislation.php">rejected legislation</a> [JURIST report] designed to combat piracy by criminalizing piracy and improving internal mechanism for trying alleged offenders. In 2010 the Irish High Court<a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ireland-court-finds-no-anti-piracy-laws-authorizing-suspension-of-internet-service.php"> ruled that the country does not recognize</a> [JURIST report] any laws that would allow ISPs to suspend service to customers suspected of Internet piracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/langues/welcome-to-the-english-website-of-the-french-national-assembly">French Parliament</a> [official website] on Wednesday adopted a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/renseignement.asp">surveillance bill</a> [materials, in French] that would give French intelligence services the authority to monitor Internet use metadata. It is <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/06/24/french-parliament-adopts-law-boosting-surveillance-powers">reported</a> [<em>AP</em> report] that the bill also allows for court ordered surveillance of suspects homes and cars utilizing beacons and tracking devices. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/france-presents-data-monitoring-legalization-bill.php">commented</a> [JURIST report] on the new law and it's provisions stating,"[t]hese are legal tools, but not tools of exception, nor of generalized surveillance of citizens. There will not be a French Patriot Act." France's previous surveillance law was passed in 1991, before much of today's mobile and internet technology.</p>

<p>Government surveillance policies have been hotly debated recently. Much of the focus comes as a <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">result of revelations </a>[JURIST backgrounder] by former <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">US National Security Agency </a>(NSA) [official website] contractor<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden"> Edward Snowden </a>[JURIST news archive], who allegedly leaked classified documents, including PRISM and UPSTREAM, in 2013, exposing the scope and breadth of NSA surveillance activities. One of the first challenges to NSA activities came in June 2013, when the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court just days after Snowden claimed responsibility for the leaks. As the outcry over the revelations began to expand in scope and severity, several other human rights groups decided to sue as well.

Last month a US District Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-warrantless-surveillance.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to NSA warrantless surveillance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/135919">released a report</a> [materials] containing evidence that many Colombian army generals and colonels knew about or should have known about extrajudicial killings of civilians between 2002 and 2008. According to the group, prosecutors are investigating a total of 3,000 cases involving military troops killing civilians to boost death counts to combat and instill fear in armed guerrilla groups in the country. The report alleges that many upper level military officials knew and may have supported the &#8220;false positive&#8221; killings exhibited in the report. José Miguel Vivanco, executive Americas director at Human Rights Watch, stated in regards to the killings, &#8220;[f]alse positive killings amount to one of the worst episodes of mass atrocity in the Western Hemisphere in recent years, and there is mounting evidence that many senior army officers bear responsibility." HRW further called on military officials to cooperate with the ongoing investigations to help bring justice for the victims and their families.</p>

<p>Criminal activity by illegal armed groups has been an ongoing issue within Colombia, with some progress being made recently. In June 2014 the country's government and the FARC rebels <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/revolutionary-armed-forces-of-colombia-agree-to-truth-commission.php">agreed to create</a> [JURIST report] a truth commission to investigate the deaths of thousands of people in the last five decades of the country's conflict. In March 2014 Human Rights Watch (HRW)<a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-illegal-armed-groups-force-inhabitants-to-flee-buenaventura-columbia.php"> issued a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that illegal armed groups have caused hundreds of people to flee Colombia's main Pacific port of Buenaventura in the previous two years. In August 2013 Colombia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/revolutionary-armed-forces-of-colombia-agree-to-truth-commission.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law providing reduced penalties for rebels who confess crimes related to their membership in illegal armed groups is constitutional. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Wednesday unsealed the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/482256/download">indictment</a> [document, PDF] of a Turkish man for allegedly organizing three cyber-attacks that led to an estimated $55 million in global losses. Ercan Findikoglu, after being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/us-usa-cyberattack-findikoglu-idUSKBN0P41XT20150624">extradited</a> [Reuters report] to the US from Germany on Tuesday, plead not guilty to 18 counts, including computer intrusion conspiracy and bank fraud, in a federal court in Brooklyn, NY. Prosecutors believe that Findikoglu was behind the organization of hackers that stole credit card data from 2010 to 2013 and distributed the information worldwide for others to make fraudulent ATM withdrawals. The charges were announced by Acting U.S. Attorney <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/meetattorney.html">Kelly T. Currie</a> [official profile] for the Eastern District of New York and Special Agent in Charge Robert J. Sica of the <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/field_offices.shtml">U.S. Secret Service New York Field Office</a> [official website]. Sica <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-mastermind-global-cybercrime-campaigns-extradited-united-states-face-charges">stated</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Today, we recognize our international law enforcement partners who were instrumental in the extradition of Ercan Findikoglu... The significance of this case cannot be understated as Findikoglu is the alleged mastermind behind the global ATM cashout operations which plagued the financial services sector from 2010 until his capture in late 2013.</blockquote></p>

<p>Due to cybercrime's international reach, many countries have recently began to implement specific laws pertaining to the Internet and cyberspace. In May a former US government employee with the Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/former-government-employee-charged-with-cybercrime-associated-with-the-department-of-energy.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with a four count violation of federal law in connection with an attempted phishing scheme involving Department of Energy employee emails. In July 2014, police <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/seven-arrested-in-16-million-stubhub-fraud-case.php">arrested seven individuals</a> [JURIST report] on charges connecting them to an international group that defrauded the online ticketing service StubHub of approximately $1.6 million. In February, the Philippines high court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/philippines-high-court-upholds-cybercrime-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] its Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012; which combats various online crimes such as hacking, identify theft, child pornography and libel. In April 2013, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/us-house-passes-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the controversial cybersecurity bill known as the <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-113hr624ih.pdf">Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act</a> (CISPA) [text, PDF] which was designed as a way to stop cyber attacks on US infrastructure as well as private companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/24/statement-president-us-governments-hostage-policy-review">announced</a> [press release] Wednesday that the government will no longer threaten litigation against families of US hostages who attempt to pay ransoms for the release of their loved ones. Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/world/obama-ordering-changes-in-us-hostage-policies.html">plans</a> [NYT report] to make this change a part of a larger overhaul of US policy on recovering hostages. He said that although the policy to not negotiate with hostage takers will remain intact, the new policy will allow the government to talk to them and aid families in doing the same. In the release Obama stated: <blockquote>Of these more than 80 Americans taken hostage since 9/11, more than half have ultimately come home, some after many years. Tragically, too many others have not.  And at this very moment, Americans continue to be held by terrorist groups or detained unjustly by foreign governments.  For them, the nightmare goes on... These families have already suffered enough, and they should never feel ignored or victimized by their own government.  Diane Foley, whose son Jim was killed by ISIL last year, said, &#8220;As Americans, we can do better.&#8221;  I totally agree.  We must do better.  And that&#8217;s why I ordered a comprehensive review of our hostage policy.</blockquote> A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/24/fact-sheet-us-government-hostage-policy">fact sheet</a> [text] released by the White House noted the new <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/hostage-recovery-fusion-cell-established">Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell</a> [FBI press release] will improve how the government develops hostage recovery plans, tracks developments in specific cases, shares information with families, and provides information to Congress and the media.</p>

<p>The changes clarify the US's approach to hostage situations, for which it has received criticism in the past. In May 2014 Republicans accused Obama of breaking the law when he <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article19346010.html">swapped</a> [Miami Herald report] five high-ranking Taliban officials in <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/2014/08/guantanamo-bay-history.php">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. However, families have been told that similar practices are not possible with hostages held captive by the likes of <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">ISIS</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/04/world_al_qaeda/html/1.stm">Al Qaeda</a> [BBC backgrounder], as the "no concessions" policy continues to apply. Families have also been given conflicting information regarding those taken hostage. After Theo Padnos was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/magazine/theo-padnos-american-journalist-on-being-kidnapped-tortured-and-released-in-syria.html">kidnapped</a> [NY Times report] in October 2012 by Al Qaeda, his mother was told by the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] that she would be prosecuted if she attempted to pay the ransom, while the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] offered to help her execute such a transaction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/king-v-burwell/">King v. Burwell</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that tax credits available to those who buy health insurance through state exchanges are also available to those who buy it through the federal exchange. At issue was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/36B">language</a> [26 USC § 36B ] in the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [materials], which made tax credits available to those who buy insurance through "an Exchange established by the State" under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18031">42 USC §18031</a> [text],  but didn't explicitly include cases where states opted to use the federal exchange.  Petitioners in the case argued that a plain-meaning interpretation of the language would not support the application to the federal exchange, and that Congress would have explicitly included the federal exchange had it meant to. But writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts disagreed, saying that providing tax credits in one case but not the other made the two types of exchanges substantially different, which was both at odds with how they were referenced in other parts of the bill and would seem to undermine its primary intent:<blockquote>Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress&#8217;s plan, and that is the reading we adopt.</blockquote>The decision upheld an <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1673339.html">earlier ruling</a> [opinion] by the US <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In it, Scalia said the majority had gone out of its way with "interpretive jiggery-pokery" to equate the state and federal exchanges, and argued that the language in question was clear and not subject such a degree of interpretation. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-subsidies-for-health-care-exchanges.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in November and heard <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-health-care-subsidies.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March. The <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">ACA</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been one of US President Barack Obama's biggest and most controversial pieces of legislation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll388.xml">286-138</a> [roll call] to approve a trade law that provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs to international trade and renews President Barack Obama's authority to negotiate trade deals on behalf of the country. It also establishes programs to increase trade between the US and Africa. The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114hr1295eas2/pdf/BILLS-114hr1295eas2.pdf">Trade Preferences Extension Act</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d114:H.R.1295:&TB_iframe=true&height=400&width=650">materials</a>] includes measures Obama has long pushed for and is seen as clearing the way for him to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) later this year. The bill was largely <a href="http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=9ab68dd2-b9a3-4e1c-90fe-5417f66c5bfe&ContentType_id=c19bc7a5-2bb9-4a73-b2ab-3c1b5191a72b&Group_id=0fd6ddca-6a05-4b26-8710-a0b7b59a8f1f">supported by Republicans</a> as part of a compromise, but <a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/pelosi-statement-on-senate-passage-of-trade-promotion-authority/">opposed by Democrats</a> [press releases] and labor union groups who say it still won't do enough to protect US jobs. Obama is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>

<p>The TPP is a proposed international trade agreement being negotiated by 12 countries: the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Chile, Peru and Brunei. The Obama Administration <a href="https://ustr.gov/tpp/outlines-of-TPP">claims the TPP</a> [TPP website] will eliminate tariffs and other barriers to trade and facilitate the development of production and supply chains among member countries. If passed, the TPP would join <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/10/us-lawmakers-approve-free-trade-agreements-with-colombia-panama-south-korea.php">several</a> other large <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2005/08/president-bush-signs-central-american.php">trade agreements</a> [JURIST reports] the US has with various countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kansas judge for the <a href="http://www.shawneecourt.org/">Shawnee County District Court</a> [official website] blocked a law on Thursday that would have effectively banned most second-trimester abortions performed in the state. Judge Larry Hendricks <a href="http://www.aol.com/article/2015/06/25/kansas-judge-weighs-nations-1st-ban-on-abortion-method/21200934/">stated</a> [AP report] that the first-in-the-nation law would have created too large of an obstacle for women in the state seeking an abortion. Opponents call the process "dismemberment abortion" while reproductive health advocates call it dilation and evacuation. This type of procedure is the most commonly used abortion procedure for in the second trimester. The new law would ban doctors, with exceptions, from using certain instruments to remove the live fetus from the womb in pieces. The state's lawyers argued during the lawsuit that doctors could perform safe abortions without resorting to this type of procedure. The Judge has put the law on hold while he considers two other Kansas abortion lawsuits.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have remained a divisive issue throughout the country for decades. In March, the <a href="http://www.legis.state.wv.us/">West Virginia Legislature</a> [official website] overrode the governor's veto, passing a <a href="http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb2568%20intr.htm&yr=2015&sesstype=RS&i=2568">bill</a> [text, HB 2586] banning abortion after 20 weeks. In February <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] asked the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] to allow the state to <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/mississippi-ag-petitions-supreme-court-to-allow-abortion-law-to-take-effect.php">enforce</a> [JURIST report] an abortion law that was declared unconstitutional by a federal court in 2014. The <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme">Montana Supreme Court </a>[official website] in February <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/montana-high-court-orders-hearing-on-abortion-parental-consent-law.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a decision granting summary judgment to <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [official website] in a case challenging two Montana abortion parental consent laws, ordering further proceedings. In January the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/house-passes-bill-restricting-abortion-funding.php">bill </a>[JURIST report] that would ban abortions supported by federal funding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] on Thursday passed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277">legislation</a> [SB277] requiring schoolchildren to be vaccinated unless there is a medical reason not to do so. The measure ends exemptions among parents opposed to vaccination due to personal or religious reasons. California is now the largest state to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/25/emotions-mount-as-california-vaccine-bill-goes-to-/?page=all">mandate vaccination</a> [AP report], joining Mississippi and West Virginia which have had similar laws for a number of years. Despite strong evidence that vaccines are necessary for public health, the number of unvaccinated children in California has been rising because exemptions on personal or religious grounds have been easy to obtain. The debate over vaccines has been a highly emotional one, with hundreds of families offering personal testimony to lawmakers at the State Capitol. Opponents of the bill argue that mandating vaccinations is against parental rights, while proponents argue that requiring vaccinations is a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/california-senate-committee-advances-bill-banning-child-vaccine-exemption.php">public health issue</a> [JURIST report]. Under the bill, parents who decline to have their children vaccinated for non-medical reasons will have to home-school their children. The bill must still be approved by the state senate and signed by the governor before becoming law.</p>

<p>Childhood vaccination and the potential harm of vaccination to children has been a topic of debate in America in recent years. Much of the vaccination debate revolves around the alleged link between certain vaccines and autism. In January a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-york-vaccination-requirement.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New York state rule barring unimmunized children from public schools. In May 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-on-attorneys-fees-under-vaccine-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that even for an untimely petition filed under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, a petitioner may recover attorney's fees as long as the claim was filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis. In February 2011 the US Supreme Court ruled that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">provides blanket immunity</a> [JURIST report] to vaccine manufacturers from all tort actions filed in state or federal court alleging design defects. The decision was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">consistent with 18 major scientific studies</a> [JURIST op-ed], which have failed to show a link between vaccines and the widely-diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder. In August 2010 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">upheld a decision finding insufficient evidence</a> [JURIST report] to link childhood vaccines and autism in three cases. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and also must recognize same-sex marriages that take place in other states. The ruling strikes down same-sex marriage bans in 15 US states. Those defending the laws had argued both that justifications for opposite-sex marriage were different than those for same-sex marriage and that the issue should be decided by the states. Writing for the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the right to marriage for same-sex couples was required by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>

<blockquote>Four principles and traditions demonstrate that the reasons marriage is fundamental under the Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples. The first premise of this Court&#8217;s relevant precedents is that the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy....

<p><br />
A second principle in this Court&#8217;s jurisprudence is that the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals....</p>

<p>A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that it safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education... .</p>

<p>Finally, this Court&#8217;s cases and the Nation&#8217;s traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of the Nation&#8217;s social order....</p>

<p>The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest.</blockquote>The decision reverses an earlier <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] .</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts as well as Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito each wrote a dissent. The dissenting justices argued that the equal treatment of opposite-sex and same-sex marriages could not be read into the Constitution and that by making its ruling, the majority had interfered with a state-by-state democratic process, which they pointed out had already been tending toward granting same-sex couples greater rights. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in January and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April. <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an extremely controversial issue in both the US and countries around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that increasing sentences on certain felons found in illegal possession of a firearm under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [text] violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the Fifth Amendment. The ACCA allows for an increased punishment if a criminal has committed three or more "violent felonies." In this case, one of the previous crimes was the possession of a sawed-off shotgun and the issue was whether the law made it clear that this was an included offense. The court ruled that this so-called "residual clause" was unconstitutionally vague, because it did not clearly outline what constituted a violent felony. The ruling reversed an <a href="http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/13/07/123123U.pdf">earlier decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>

The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-jerusalem-birthplace-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in April 2014 and originally heard <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-evidence-destruction-shotgun-possession.php">oral arguments</a> in November before ordering a <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-firearm-possession-case.php">reargument</a> [JURIST reports] oral arguments specific to the question of vagueness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_m64o.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/texas-department-of-housing-and-community-affairs-v-the-inclusive-communities-project-inc/">Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Texas's biggest housing subsidy has been reinforcing segregated housing. The project claimed that even if Texas did not treat minority applicants differently, the subsidy program had the effect of disadvantaging them, under a so-called "disparate impact" theory. The question before the court was whether disparate impact claims could be brought under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/title8.php">Fair Housing Act</a> [text]. Writing for the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy found they could:<blockquote>The Court holds that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act upon considering its results-oriented language, the Court&#8217;s interpretation of similar language in Title VII and the ADEA, Congress&#8217; ratification of disparate-impact claims in 1988 against the backdrop of the unanimous view of nine Courts of Appeals, and the statutory purpose.</blockquote>The decision affirms an <a href="http://www.tdhca.state.tx.us/multifamily/docs/icp-docs/AppealsOpinion.pdf">earlier ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a dissent joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in October and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-housing-discrimination-traffic-stops.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian Foreign Minister <a href="http://mofa.pna.ps/eng/the-ministry/the-minister/">Riyad al-Maliki</a> [official profile] said Thursday that he had <a href="http://mofa.pna.ps/?p=7199">presented documents</a> [press release, in Arabic] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to assist in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes. The documents describe the Israel occupation of the West Bank, treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and alleged war crimes committed during fighting in the Gaza Strip last year. Both the US and Israel <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-slams-palestinians-israel-war-crimes-suit/">have criticized</a> [<em>Times of Israel</em> report] the Palestinian Authority's submission, calling in "unproductive" and challenging whether it is qualified as a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/palestine-formally-joins-the-icc.php">member of the court</a> [JURIST report].</p>

<p>The Israel-Palestine conflict continues to be a significant international legal issue. Earlier this month the UN <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/06/un-finds-evidence-of-war-crimes-by-both-israel-and-hamas-in-conflict.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] finding evidence of war crimes by both Israel and Palestinian Hamas fighters. Also this month an international group of high-ranking military officials and diplomats <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-watch-military-group-finds-israel-acted-defensively-reasonably-in-gaza-conflict.php">issued its own report</a> [JURIST report], finding that Israel met or exceeded international standards during the conflict. In April the <a href="http://www.idf.il/english/">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] ordered a female Palestinian legislative council member to serve a six-month <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/israel-authorities-order-detention-of-palestine-lawmaker.php">detention without trial</a> [JURIST report] under a system meant to protect from attacks from militants. Later that month, a UN independent board of inquiry uncovered <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-israel-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-in-gaza.php">evidence</a> [JURIST report] that at least 44 Palestinians were killed and 227 injured by "Israeli action" during the Gaza conflict of 2014. In May, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] condemned Hamas for <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/amnesty-condemns-human-rights-abuses-by-hamas-forces.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], accusing the group of leading a series of abductions, torturous acts and unlawful killings against Palestinians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands of protesters marched in Honduras on Friday calling for the resignation of <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.hn/">President Juan Hernandez </a>[official website, in Spanish] and demanding an independent investigation into his role in an ongoing corruption scandal. Hernandez is <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/06/27/honduras-protest-idINKBN0P704J20150627">accused of</a> [Reuters report] knowingly using money from a $200 million embezzlement scandal at the Honduran Institute (IHSS) of Social Security to help pay for his 2013 presidential campaign. Hernandez last week acknowledged that his campaign <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/thousands-rally-call-honduras-president-quit-150606111914364.html">did receive funds</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] from people involved with the scandal, but stated he and his party had not been made aware of where that money had come from. </p>

<p>Honduras has a history of struggling with corruption and its leaders being forced from power. In January 2013 the <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">Honduran National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] approved controversial <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/honduras-lawmakers-pass-police-corruption-law.php">amendments to the police law</a> [JURIST report] designed to eliminate corruption. Approval came after the congress voted to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/honduras-congress-votes-to-remove-supreme-court-justices.php">dismiss four justices</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/">Supreme Court</a> [official websites, in Spanish] a week earlier, after the justices ruled that the police reform bill supported by then-president <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/porfirio_lobo_sosa/index.html">Porfirio Lobo</a> [NYT profile] was unconstitutional. Tension between the three branches of government in Honduras has risen recently, and Lobo has expressed concern that he may be forced out of office like his predecessor, who was removed during the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">2009 military coup</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2011 the Honduran Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/honduras-truth-commission-says-coup-was-unconstitutional.php">coup was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but stated that former president Manuel Zelaya was culpable when he ignored orders of the Supreme Court. Zelaya <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-ex-president-zelaya-signs-agreement-allowing-return-to-country.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011 allowing his return to the country after nearly two years in exile.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's military government on Friday blocked the launch of a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/136023">report </a>[text] on the Vietnamese government's persecution of an ethnic minority, citing concerns for international security and the country's relationship with Vietnam. The launch was scheduled to take place at the<a href="http://www.fccthai.com/"> Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand</a> (FCCT) [official website], and is the third event to be cancelled at the venue this month. A written order was given to the FCCT and HRW by police to cancel the press conference that was to be held for the report's release. The report by HRW, based on interviews with minorities seeking asylum and official Vietnamese media reports, discusses the Vietnamese government's persecution of ethnic Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's Central Highlands. It describes both religious and political persecution faced by Montagnards, who practice De Ga Protestantism and Ha Mon Catholicism. The religious practices have been dubbed "evil way" religions by the government, and official Vietnamese media show a policy to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/136135">put an end to their practice</a> [HRW report], according to HRW. HRW senior researcher in Asia <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/sunai-phasuk">Sunai Phasuk</a> [official profile] expressed disappointment in the cancellation of the report's launch, saying that "Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in (south-east Asia), which added more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under military rule."</p>

<p>Thailand has undergone political turmoil since the military coup in May 2014 when the country's armed forces <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-armed-forces-impose-martial-law.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on a military run television station, citing Thailand's martial law act of 1914 as the basis for the military's action. Just two days later, Chan-ocha announced that the military had seized control of the country and <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">suspended its constitution</a> [JURIST report]. In May of this year, Thailand's military government announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/thailand-government-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">hold a referendum</a> [JURIST report] on a new constitution, likely delaying the general elections scheduled for mid-2016. Thailand is currently operating under a temporary charter as its previous constitution was abolished after the coup. In April UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-concerned-by-thailand-governments-new-security-order.php">expressed alarm</a> [JURIST report] over the Thai government's decision to replace martial law with a new security order. In July Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/thailand-king-endorses-interim-constitution.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] for the interim constitution despite concern from the international community. In September a group of Thai human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/thailand-rights-activists-call-for-end-to-martial-law.php">activists denounced</a> [JURIST report] and called for an end to the country's state of martial law, accusing the ruling militia of imposing a judicial "twilight zone."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official website] leaders <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/06/26-euco-conclusions/">announced</a> [press release] Friday that a final quota compromise had been reached regarding the large number of illegal immigrants arriving in Italy and Greece after crossing the Mediterranean sea. It is estimated that over 120,000 migrants have made the dangerous sea crossing in the past year, most fleeing from Syria and other war-torn nations. The final compromise of relocating 40,000 immigrants in the next two years into EU member countries was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-furious-italian-pm-matteo-renzi-forces-belated-compromise-on-quotas-at-eu-leaders-summit-10349039.html">strongly supported</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] by Italian PM Matteo Renzi. Many EU countries, notably Eastern European countries, have rejected the mandatory quota initiative and the UK was opted out of the plan. At the meeting, leaders discussed strategies to prevent the further loss of life at sea as well as ways to deal with the smugglers and traffickers according to international law while respecting the right to seek asylum. A consensus decisions regarding the distribution of immigrants is expected by the end of July. A strong policy of reintegration to the country of origin for illegal migrants who do not qualify for international protection was also proposed as a way to discourage people from continuing to risk their lives at sea.</p>

<p>Refugees from conflict areas in Africa and the Middle East have generated a tremendous humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean with hundreds of deaths in recent months. Early in June a British warship sailing in the Mediterranean Sea <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/british-ship-embarks-on-rescue-mission-of-over-500-migrants-in-mediterranean.php">launched a mission</a> [JURIST report] to rescue over 500 migrants stranded at sea. Also in June Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/amnesty-urges-world-leaders-to-act-on-refugee-crisis.php">called</a> [JURIST report] the situation the worst refugee crisis since World War II. In April top UN human rights officials and the International Organization for Migration <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-calls-on-eu-to-set-up-rescue-operation-for-migrants-at-sea.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling on the EU to create a new rescue operation program for migrants attempting to traverse the Mediterranean and to commit to greater receipt of refugees. Also in April UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-experts-eu-must-develop-solutions-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the EU that repression of irregular migration cannot be the only solution to the recurrent grave problem of masses of people drowning at sea. In February a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-court-opens-investigation-into-cueta-migrant-drowning-incident.php">accused 16 civil guards</a> [JURIST report] of using excessive force against 15 sub-Saharan immigrants who drowned attempting to swim around a seawall between Ceuta and Morocco last February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Dominican Republic President <a href="http://danilomedina.do/">Danilo Medina</a> [official website, in Spanish] announced Friday that the country had certified the citizenship of thousands whose status had been in question for almost a decade. Their citizenship <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dominican-republic-certifies-citizenship-55000-32064106">was in question</a> [AP report] based on their Haitan-immigrant-parents illegal entry into the country. As a result, they had had trouble enrolling in school, travelling, getting formal work, marrying or registering children for lack of residence documents. Despite the announcement, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/issues-ideas/article25371358.html">even more immigrants</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] are at risk of deportation under undocumented immigrant crackdowns.</p>

<p>Immigration issues in the Dominican Republic have been a topic of controversy for years. In October 2013, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International (AI)</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/ai-dominican-republic-should-not-implement-court-ruling-on-nationality.php">called upon</a> [JURIST Report] the Dominican Republic reject a constitutional court ruling that would impact the nationality of Dominicans of foreign descent. A group of Caribbean nations also <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/caricom-condemns-dominican-migrant-court-ruling-20607467">condemned </a>[AP report] the court's ruling. <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/fact-sheets/crisis-nationality-dominicans-haitian-descent">Dominicans of Haitian descent</a> [Open Society backgrounder] have historically experience discrimination in the Dominican Republic. AI detailed these practices in a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR27/011/2012/en/984d89f1-06d1-4282-8282-6fa3d114f5da/amr270112012en.html">report</a> [text] in July 2010. The report specifically cites the issue of identity documents as the cause of the abuse. The ruling was<a href="http://nbclatino.com/2013/09/28/dominican-republic-to-end-citizenship-for-haitian-descended-residents/"> issued</a> [AP report] in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16302">Periodic Review Board</a> (PRB) [official fact sheet] announced Friday that one of the longest-held detainees at <a href="/feature/2014/08/guantanamo-bay-history.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] may now be released to his home country of Saudi Arabia. Abdul Rahman Shalabi has been on a nine-year hunger strike and <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article25583941.html">would be released</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] into a Saudi Arabian government rehabilitation program. Shalabi was detained in January 2002 and was accused of being a bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden. However, he was never formally charged. He began a hunger strike in 2005 and <a href="http://www.prs.mil/portals/60/documents/ISN042/150421_U_ISN042_Opening_Statements_of_Detainees_Representatives_PUBLIC.pdf">maintained the protest</a> [PRB statement, PDF] longer than any other prisoner on the base. He wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/guantanamo-detainee-conditions-have.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 detailing his strike and the criticizing conditions at the prison. The review board, which was created in 2011 as part of the effort to close Guantanamo, has been reevaluating numerous cases of prison previously identified as too dangerous to be released. </p>

<p>Many prisoners are being released from Guantanamo Bay as attempts are continuing to shut it down, creating a great deal of controversy regarding past practices at the prison. In May the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/appeals-court-declines-to-get-involved-in-case-regarding-guantanamo-video-footage.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] not to get involved, for the time being, in a case regarding whether the public should have access to video footage showing Guantanamo detainee Abu Wa'el Dhiab being force-fed. Dhiab was cleared for release by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2010/06/02/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf">Guantanamo Review Task Force</a> [report, PDF] in 2009, but he remained at the prison until last year. In 2013, while still awaiting his release, he participated in a hunger strike with other inmates, which prompted guards to begin force-feeding them. In April a US government source <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/guantanamo-detainee-set-to-be-released-in-june.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Shaker Aamer, a Saudi citizen Saudi citizen and former UK resident detained at Guantanamo, was expected to be released in June after recent calls from the UK government. In February the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainees-challenge-to-force-feeding.php#.U0QSz_ldXT8">denied</a> [JURIST report] Aamer and three other detainees their request for injunctive relief to stop prison authorities from force-feeding prisoners to end their hunger strike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In that case, <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_5439">Baze v. Rees</a> [Oyez Project backgrounder], the court held that a challenge to an execution method must show a "demonstrated risk of severe pain" and that the risk is "substantial when compared to the known and available alternatives." Because much of the petition was based on factual findings of the trial court, the court used a higher <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/legal-writing-scholarship/writing-center/upload/standardsofreview.pdf">clear error</a> [Georgetown Law backgrounder, PDF] standard in reviewing the lower ruling. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, found that level of error had not been shown. The ruling affirms an earlier <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-6244.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>

<p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor wrote dissents. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-to-review-oklahoma-death-penalty-protocols.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in January and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-oklahoma-lethal-injection-procedure.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April. </p>

Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Elections Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. At issue was a <a href="http://azredistricting.org/about-irc/default.asp">proposition</a> [materials] passed by Arizona voters that created a special commission to draw congressional districts, a role that had traditionally been filled by the state legislature. The legislature challenged the legitimacy of the board, but writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that not only was the commission permissible under the Elections Clause, but that the Arizona state legislature lacked standing to challenge it. The ruling upheld and earlier <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12500669603536296877&q=Arizona+State+Legislature+v.+Arizona+Independent+Redistricting+Commission&hl=en&as_sdt=20000006">decision</a> [opinion] by the US District Court for the District of Arizona.</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissent, as did Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-grants-adds-eleven-new-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> to the case in October and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-congressional-redistricting-confrontation-clause.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-46_10n2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 on Monday that the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a> [official website] could not make regulations regarding the toxic emissions of power plants without considering costs. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/michigan-v-environmental-protection-agency/">Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [SCOTUSBLOG materials], the court considered the question of whether the EPA could create regulations under the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412#n">Clean Air Act</a> [42 USC §7412(n)(1)(A)] irrespective of costs that would be incurred. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority: <blockquote> Our reasoning so far establishes that it was unreasonable for EPA to read §7412(n)(1)(A) to mean that cost is irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate power plants. The Agency must consider cost&#8212;including, most importantly, cost of compliance&#8212;before deciding whether regulation is appropriate and necessary... It will be up to the Agency to decide (as always, within the limits of reasonable interpretation) how to account for cost.</blockquote> Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion while Justice Elena Kagan wrote a dissent with Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Breyer joining, "[T]he result is a decision that deprives the American public of the pollution control measures that the responsible Agency, acting well within its delegated authority, found would save many, many lives." This decision reversed a <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/284AC47088C07D0985257CBB004F0795/$file/12-1100-1488346.pdf">ruling</a> from the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circut</a> [official website] in favor of the EPA. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-disability-rights-epa-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in November and <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-epa-case.php">heard</a> [JURIST reports] the case in March after the Court of Appeals upheld the regulations. This ruling comes amid other legal challenges to EPA regulations. In April, the US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/federal-appellate-court-hears-challenge-to-proposed-epa-regulation.php">heard a case</a> [JURIST report] concerning EPA regulations meant to slow climate change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062915zor_4g25.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in four cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-981.htm">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</a> [docket; <a href="http://lyldenlawnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fisher-II-cert-petition-2-10-15.pdf">cert. petition</a>], Abigail Fisher brought suit against the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), alleging that its race-conscious admission program violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the 14th Amendment. Fisher was denied admission to UT Austin under their holistic review program, which reviews applicants based on, among many other factors, special circumstances such as socioeconomic background and race. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted summary judgment to UT, and the United States Court of Appeals for the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-50822-CV2.pdf">affirmed</a> [text, PDF].</p>

<p>The second case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-181.htm">Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gobeille-v-Liberty-Mutual-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>], addresses the question of whether the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/erisa.htm">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [official backgrounder] preempts a Vermont statute in setting minimum standards for employee healthcare services. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1656326.html">reversed</a> [text] a district court ruling, finding that ERISA did preempt the state law.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1095.htm">Musacchio v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/14-1095.pdf">cert.petition</a>], Michael Mussacchio was found guilty of having fraudulently accessed a protected computer of a competitor. The instruction given at trial required the jury to find that Musacchio both agreed to make unauthorized access <em>and</em> exceeded authorized access, when the statute requires only that he agreed to make unauthorized access <em>or</em> exceed authorized access. On appeal, Musacchio urges that because the government did not object, the erroneous instruction "became the law of the case," and that the government failed to meet the standard set forth. The Fifth Circuit found against Musacchio and <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/13/13-11294.0.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] his sentence. </p>

<p>Finally, the Second Circuit also decided the question, does "a conviction...for attempted arson in the third degree constitute an "aggravated felony" under the Immigration and Nationality Act?" In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1096.htm">Torres v. Lynch</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/14-1095.pdf">cert. petition</a>], Jorge Luna Torres, a native of the Dominican Republic, was convicted of attempted arson in the third degree in 1999, and was subsequently denied United States citizenship as a result. Second Circuit <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1675910.html">affirmed</a> [opinion] the Board of Immigration Appeals decision to deny citizenship. The Supreme Court will now determine if, under certain circumstances, a state offense is sufficient to constitute a felony conviction and bar citizenship. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French officials on Tuesday ordered the trial of two senior executives for <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber Technologies</a> [official website] on allegations of maintaining an illegal taxi service. <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pierredimitri">Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty</a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/thibaudsimphal">Thibaud Simphal</a> [LinkedIn profiles], general managers for Western Europe and France respectively, were detained on Monday for alleged violations of a French transportation law that bans running unlicensed taxi services. The two executives had previously said that UberPOP, a service of Uber, would continue to run in France until a court ruled against their service, despite being illegal since late last year. The service is accused of violating <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do%3FidArticle%3DLEGIARTI000024958566%26cidTexte%3DLEGITEXT000005627819%26dateTexte%3D20150630%26fastPos%3D1%26fastReqId%3D536825004%26oldAction%3DrechCodeArticle&usg=ALkJrhhEPPdpVAwrLj6W9QziD600ADYS-w">Article 40 of the French Penal Code</a> [text, in French], punishable by a 300,000 euro fine and two years in prison. The trial <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/30/us-france-uber-idUSKCN0PA18Y20150630">is set</a> [Reuters report] for September 30.</p>

<p>Uber has been banned or is facing legal trouble in many nations around the world, including the United States. Last week, France <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33267581">saw multiple riots</a> [BBC report] staged by FTI in an effort to force a government crackdown on Uber. In April, taxi drivers in London staged a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/london-streets-blockaded-as-taxi-drivers-protest-against-uber/">similar coup</a> [CNET report], blockading London's busy Oxford Street to bring awareness to the hardships they face due to undercutting by Uber. In January, the California Labor Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/california-labor-commission-rules-uber-drivers-are-employees-not-contractors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that drivers for Uber are considered employees, not contractors, which could lead to higher costs for the company as they may have to begin paying benefits. Late last year, district attorneys from San Francisco and Los Angeles <a href="/dateline/2015/01/danielle-ardner-uber-safety.php">filed a consumer protection lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Uber for misleading consumers about their safety and overcharging.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt's chief prosecutor, <a href="http://jurist.justia.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi">Hisham Barakat</a> [JURIST news archive], was killed Monday in Cairo by a car bomb attack on his convoy. Barakat's vehicle <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/egypt-state-prosecutor-motorcade-hit-bomb-attack-cairo-150629083650272.html">was attacked</a> [Al Jazeera report] by a car outfitted with explosives that was remotely detonated when his motorcade left his home in Heliopolis. The prosecutor's death marks the country's first assassination of a senior official in 25 years, and seems to be the result of retribution attempts by Islamic militants in response to the governmental crackdown on the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile]. It is believed that Barakat became a target as a result of his role as prosecutor against many Brotherhood members and other Islamists, including former <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile]. An Egyptian militant group calling itself "Popular Resistance in Giza" claims responsibility for the remote detonation of a car bomb that proved fatal to Bakarat, however the claim could not be independently verified. While the authorities suspect the Brotherhood for the attack, they have denied all involvement. </p>

<p>Egypt has faced great political turmoil since the ouster of Mohammed Morsi in 2013, with an especially strong backlash against the Muslim Brotherhood and other Morsi supporters and Islamists. Egyptian courts have sentenced large groups of Brotherhood members to both <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-court-sentences-69-muslim-brotherhood-supporters.php">long term imprisonment</a>, and even <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-supporters-to-death.php">death</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, Morsi, along with 100 others, were <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-morsi-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] for their involvement in a mass prison break in 2011. In the immediate aftermath, 30 more members of the Brotherhood were sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/egypt-court-sentences-30-islamists-to-life-imprisonment.php">life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] <em>in absentia</em>. In early June, two of the Brotherhood's leaders were <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/egypt-authorities-arrest-muslim-brotherhood-leaders.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] after already having been convicted and sentenced to death <em>in absentia</em>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/">UNESCO World Heritage Committee</a> [official website] said Monday that extremist groups' destruction of antiquities and heritage sites in conflict zones could amount to war crimes. The committee noted particularly the <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/detail.php">Islamic State's</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder] destruction of the ancient city of Hatra in Iraq, and was deeply concerned about the group's capture of Palmyra in May. Both cities are UNESCO World Heritage sites, and carry much archaeological significance. The committee adopted a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/39com/documents/">resolution</a> [materials] which states in part that "[i]ntentional attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes and historic monuments may amount to war crimes". The resolution also expressed UNESCO's deep shock and alarm at the repeated attacks by IS "aimed at destroying cultural diversity through deliberate targeting of individuals and communities on the basis of cultural, ethnic or religious background, as well as places of worship, memory and learning" as well as looting and excavations that "seriously undermine irreplaceable cultural treasures". </p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013. In March, the UN <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/un-islamic-state-may-be-committing-genocide-war-crimes.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that other actions by IS may be war crimes. In February, the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">jointly released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violations against Iraqi civilians under the spread of IS. Also in February IS led suicide bombings in eastern Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/islamic-state-kills-40-in-suicide-bombing.php">killing at least 40 people</a> [JURIST report] and injuring 70 more. IS said this was the group's way of retaliating against Egyptian airstrikes protesting the IS presence in Northern Africa. In December the UK-based <a href="http://syriahr.com/en/">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported that the IS <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/isis-executed-1878-people-in-syria-over-six-months.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 1,878 people in Syria between June and December. February's suicide bombings indicate that the number of executions continues to increase. That month the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the groups beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/14A1288-order-6-29-15.pdf">granted a motion to stay</a> [order, PDF], allowing over half of Texas' 18 abortion clinics to stay open by temporarily blocking a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/id/870667">law</a> [HB 2] that would place stringent requirements on clinics requiring the majority of them to close. The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] earlier this month <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-50928-CV0.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] some of the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-controversial-parts-of-texas-abortion-law.php">strictest parts of the Texas abortion law</a> [JURIST report], which allowed the state to require abortion clinics to satisfy hospital-level operating standards including minimum room size and staffing levels. The law also required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The stay is in effect while the court considers whether to hear the case.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">Abortion</a> [JURIST archive] related issues have been a heated topic of discussion for the past several years in the US. Earlier this month the North Carolina legislature gave <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-72-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">final approval</a> [JURIST report] to the Women and Children's Protection Act of 2015, which mandates a 72-hour waiting period for abortions after a woman has been informed of her options and the risks of the procedure, except in the case of a medical emergency. In May the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-idaho-abortion-laws.php">struck down </a>[JURIST report] two parts of Idaho abortion laws-one which banned all abortions after 20 weeks, and the other which required that women seeking abortions in their second trimester do so in a hospital. Also in May Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/tennessee-adopts-48-hour-abortion-waiting-period.php">adopted a law</a> [JURIST report] that requires 48-hour waiting periods for women seeking an abortion. In April Alabama state representative Teri Collins <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/alabama-lawmaker-proposes-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">proposed a bill to ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] once a fetal heartbeat has been detected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tunisian Interior Minister Najem Gharsalli announced Monday that authorities had arrested a group of individuals suspected to have supported a Friday attack that killed 39 at a beach resort. The <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has claimed responsibility for the attack and the shooter, Seifeddine Rezgui, was killed by the police. Gharsalli said he <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/terror-suspects-arrested-tunisia-four-wounded-britons-flown-home">suspected an even larger network</a> [Guardian report] of supporters enabled the attack. Many of those kille were British citizens, and the UK has sent officials to Tunisia to investigate the attack.</p>

<p>Many countries have recently drafted <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi">counter-terrorism</a> [JURIST archives] laws in response to terrorist groups like the Islamic State. However, many human rights organizations have expressed concern over such legislation warning that it sometimes <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-human-rights-must-be-protected-when-fighting-terrorism.php">sacrifices human rights in the fight against terrorism </a>[JURIST report] solely because abridging those rights is politically convenient. In April, an <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/memo.2015.04.08.Tunisia%20Counterterrorism%20Law.eng_.pdf">analysis</a> [text, PDF] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]  of the Tunisian government's draft counterterrorism law suggested that the law as drafted could potentially lead to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-concerned-over-tunisia-draft-counterterrorism-law.php">serious human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report]. Permitting extended incommunicado detention, weakening due process guarantees for people charged with terrorism offenses, and allowing the death penalty for anyone convicted of a terrorist attack resulting in death. In January,HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/20/china-draft-counterterrorism-law-recipe-abuses">criticized</a> [press release] China's proposed <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/lfgz/flca/2014-11/03/content_1885027.htm">counter-terrorism legislation</a> [text, in Chinese] as a "recipe for abuses." The organization <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-chinas-proposed-counterterrorism-law-facilitates-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern </a>[JURIST report] over the definitions in the draft, which defined terrorism as "thought, speech, or behavior" that attempt to "influence national policy-making," "subvert state power," or "split the state," saying that the definition was too broad and granted too much latitude to the state to punish individuals for seemingly innocuous actions.</p><p>[JURIST] Tunisian authorities arrested a group of individuals suspected to be associated with the gunman who killed 39 people,in a beach hotel attack said Interior Minister Najem Gharsalli on Monday.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/">New York Department of Environmental Conservation</a> (NYDEC) [official website] released a final <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/materials_minerals_pdf/findingstatehvhf62015.pdf">environmental impact statement</a> [report, PDF] on the dangers of fracking on Monday, which carries the force of law and officially bans fracking in the state. Signed by NYDEC <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/about/243.html">Commissioner Joseph Martens</a> [official profile], the report cited significant water withdrawals, increased stormwater runoffs, potential severe flooding and inadequate waste disposal as possible dangers that may affect the state's water resources. The report also cited the dangers of increased greenhouse gas emissions and the release of <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Radiation-and-Health/Naturally-Occurring-Radioactive-Materials-NORM/">naturally occurring radioactive material</a> [World Nuclear Association site]. The Department considered extensive mitigation measures but were not convinced as to their efficacy. "In the end...[t]he Department&#8217;s chosen alternative to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing is the best alternative based on the balance between protection of the environment and public health and economic and social considerations." This decision confirms a report issued in December by New York Governor <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] and his administration affirming their intent will <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/new-york-governor-to-ban-fracking-statewide.php">block hydraulic fracturing</a> [JURIST report] across the state. </p>

<p>Hydraulic fracturing, or <a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">fracking</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a controversial method of tapping natural gas deposits with high pressurized water. The method, commonly used in <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/econresource/oilandgas/marcellus/marcellus_faq/marcellus_shale/index.htm">Marcellus shale</a> [PA DCNR website] deposits, has raised environmental and public health concerns. In March, the Maryland <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home">House of Delegates</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/maryland-lawmakers-approve-3-year-fracking-moratorium.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to place a 3-year moratorium on fracking in the state. Also in March US Secretary of the Interior <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretaryjewell.cfm">Sally Jewell</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/obama-administration-publishes-federal-fracking-regulations.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the publication of a rule regulating fracking on federal land. In January Scotland <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium on the granting of permits for unconventional oil and gas extraction, including fracking amid environmental and health concerns. In December New York Governor Andrew Cuomo [official website] and his administration issued a report affirming their intent will block hydraulic fracturing [JURIST report] across the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Circuit misapplied the Supreme Court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17579461034052260962&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Holland v. Florida</a> [opinion] decision when it ruled that the Menominee Tribe was not entitled to tolling of the statute of limitations for filing of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-14/subchapter-II">Indian Self-Determination Act</a> [text] claims for unpaid contract support costs under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/subtitle-III/chapter-71">Contract Disputes Act</a> [text]. </p>

<p>The court will also decide <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/14-915.htm">Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Friedrichs-v.-California-Teachers-Association-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], which considers the First Amendment constitutionality of a California law that requires public school teachers to financially contribute to the teacher's union, and also requires those teachers to subsidize union expenses unrelated to collective bargaining unless a teacher affirmatively objects and renews that objection in writing annually.</p>

<p>The court will rule on <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/14a896.htm">Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Manning</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Manning-Cert-Petition-Final.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF] and resolve the circuit split on whether Section 27 of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF] provides federal jurisdiction over state-law claims based on violations or desired enforcement of the Act. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits have held that the Act does provide federal jurisdiction, while the Second and Third Circuits have held that it does not.</p>

<p>Lastly, the court will decide <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1175.htm">Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Franchise-Tax-Board-of-California-PFC.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], which deals with the  issue of whether Nevada may refuse to give the same immunities to other states brought into Nevada court that Nevada itself enjoys. The court will also rule on the state sovereignty issue of whether <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9501783408739732266&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Nevada v. Hall</a> [opinion] , a case that held a state may be hauled into court by another state without its consent, should be overruled.</p>]]></content:encoded>
