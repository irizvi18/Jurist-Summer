		<title>Texas Supreme Court: states not required to provide publicly funded benefits to same-sex couples</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/supreme">Supreme Court of Texas </a> [official website] <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/media/1438061/150688.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Friday that the Houston's benefits policy need not extend to same-sex couples. In so holding, the Court concluded that: "The [US] Supreme Court held in <em>Obergefell</em> that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages, but it did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons." The trial court had issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the mayor and the city of Houston from "furnishing  benefits to persons who were married in other jurisdictions to City employees of the same sex." The Court of Appeals reversed the injunction and remanded the case back to the trial court holding that the lower court must conduct its proceedings consistent with the federal Fifth Circuit decision in <em>DeLeon v. Perry</em>. The Texas Supreme Court disagreed, but vacated the trial court injunction holding that:</p>

<blockquote>The trial court should certainly proceed on remand "in light of" De Leon, but it is not required to proceed "consistent with" it ... We  hold  that  the  court  of  appeals' judgment  does  not  bar  Pidgeon  from  seeking  all  appropriate  relief on remand or bar the Mayor from opposing that relief. We hold that the court of appeals did not err by failing to affirm the temporary injunction "to the extent" it required the City to claw back payments made prior to Obergefell. And we decline to instruct the trial court how to construe Obergefell on remand.</blockquote>

<p>The plaintiffs' central argument was that the extension of marriage benefits goes farther than the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] contemplated in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/"><em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em></a> [SCOTUSblog materials], which <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] same-sex couples the right to have their marriages legally recognized. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court originally declined to hear this case, but <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/06/30/535021154/texas-supreme-court-rules-against-benefits-for-same-sex-couples">reconsidered</a> [NPR report] under pressure from many top Texas Republicans, including <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a>, and state <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Ken Paxton</a> [official websites].</p>

<p>Same-sex couple rights have become one of the most controversial issues facing society in the past few years, with mixed developments around the world. On Friday Germany's <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/">lower house of Parliament</a> (Bundestag) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 393-226 to legalize same-sex marriage. This development follows Bundestag's <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/bundestag-to-compensate-5000-persecuted-under-anti-homosexuality-laws.php">passing of a bill</a> [JURIST report] last week to compensate thousands of individuals in Germany who had been persecuted and imprisoned for their sexuality. On Tuesday the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-colorado-cakeshop-and-whistleblower-cases-denies-review-of-important-ca.php">agreed to hear </a> [JURIST report] a case concerning a bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. In May Taiwan's constitutional court, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/en/p01_03.asp">Judicial Yuan</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/taiwan-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex marriages will be legally recognized. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the <a href="/paperchase/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20Prohibition%20Act.pdf">Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act</a> [text, PDF]. Earlier the same month the Nebraska Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/-nebraska-top-court-strikes-down-ban-on-same-sex-foster-parenting.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision overruling the Nebraska's long-time ban on same sex partner foster parenting. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/index.de.html">Austria Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] on Friday <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/downloads/VfGH_G_53-2017_Verkuendungstext_Hitlers_Geburtshaus.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; in German] that the government seizure of the apartment complex where Nazi leader <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adolf-Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> [Britannica profile] was born is constitutional. The Court elaborated [press release, PDF; <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/downloads/VfGH_Presseinfo_G_53-2017_Presseinfo_Hitlers_Geburtshaus.pdf">German</a> and <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/downloads/VfGH_G_53-2017_Press_release_Hitler_s_Birthplace.pdf">English</a>] that "the expropriation of Adolf Hitler&#8217;s birthplace in Braunau (Upper Austria) by law was in the public interest, commensurate and not without compensation, and therefore not unconstitutional." The government felt it was necessary to seize the property to ensure that it did not become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis, who have turned it into a meeting place in recent years. The Court agreed and added: </p>

<blockquote>Nobody&#8212;not even the legal counsel of the applicant&#8212;denies the public interest in measures taken to that effect. However, the measures recommended by the [expert] commissions [of the Federal Minister of the Interior] as necessary to prevent the identification of the property and, thus, deprive it of its symbolic power, can only be taken if the Republic of Austria obtains full power of disposal of the property.</blockquote>

<p>The property, a few hundred meters away from the border with Germany was owned by Gerlinde Pommer-Angloher, and was seized through Austria's expropriation law. Pommer-Angloher <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/austrian-court-state-seizure-of-hitlers-home-lawful/a-39487494">rejected several offers</a> [DW report] from the government to purchase the property from her, which was bought back by her mother post World War II after Nazi-Germany forced Pommer-Angloher's grandparents to sell it to the government. This was a constitutional challenge brought forth by Pommer-Angloher to Austria's expropriation law.</p>

<p>Efforts to seek justice and restitution for the victims of the Nazi Germany era are still underway, over 70 years after the close of World War II. In May, Romania enacted <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/romania-enacts-legislation-enabling-restitution-for-holocaust-survivors.php">legislation</a> [JURIST report] enabling restitution for Holocaust survivors. In November 2016, the Germany <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/germany-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-nazi-officer.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of former Nazi SS Officer <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32336353">Oskar Groening</a> [BBC profile], known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," for his role in the deaths of over 300,000 people during the Holocaust. Two months earlier, the Neubrandenburg state court in Germany started the trial of a 95-year-old former <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-begins-trial-of-95-year-old-former-ss-medic.php"> SS medic</a> [JURIST report] who served at the Auschwitz camp. The same month, a court in Kiel, Germany, ruled that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-rules-92-year-old-woman-unfit-to-stand-trial-for-auschwitz-deaths.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">2011 conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7998947.stm">John Demjanjuk</a> [BBC profile] may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Iowa Supreme Court: private citizens can sue government officials for rights violations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a narrow <a href="http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/Supreme_Court_Opinions/Recent_Opinions/20170630/15-0695.pdf">4-3 decision</a> [opinion, PDF], the <a href="http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/">Supreme Court of Iowa</a> [official website] ruled on Friday that former Iowa Workers' Compensation Commissioner, and now chief judge of the board, Christopher Godfrey can sue high-ranking government officials, including Governor <a href="https://governor.iowa.gov/">Kim Reynolds</a> [official website] and former Governor Terry Branstad, for violating equal protection and due process rights granted by the <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/icnst/402726.pdf">Iowa Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Specifically, the decision allows Democrat Godfrey to seek damages against Republican Branstad for political retaliation. But more broadly, the ruling opens the door for private citizens to seek monetary damages from government officials who have violated their rights under the state's constitution, a ruling with parallels to the landmark <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4836406244398815814"><em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents</em></a> [Opinion, text]. The Court stated that The fourth vote came from Justice Mark Cady, who concurred in the judgement but dissented on key issues, writing that the plaintiff did not need to rely on constitutional protections because statutory remedies for his claim are already available through the <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/DOCS/ACO/IC/LINC/Chapter.216.pdf">Iowa Civil Rights Act</a> [text, PDF]. However, the majority disagreed with that position on at least some of the issues, and responded:</p>

<blockquote>The due process claims based on alleged partisan motivation in depriving Godfrey of property and liberty interests contrary to due process are not claims within the scope of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As a result, there is no basis to assert that Iowa Code chapter 216 provides an adequate remedy to avoid the necessity of a free-standing damages claim.</blockquote>

<p>The Court's 104-page opinion overturns a lower court's dismissal most of the plaintiff's claims, but the Court declined to rule on the merits. </p>

<p>Godfrey, <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/30/godfrey-can-sue-state-over-branstads-actions-justices-rule/442623001/">had been appointed</a> [AP report] to the position by Democratic Governor Chet Culver in 2009. A year later, incoming Republican Governor Branstad asked for Godfrey's resignation. When Godfrey declined the request, claiming the position was quasi-judicial and intended to be nonpartisan, Branstad reduced his salary from $112,000 to $73,000, the lowest possible amount for the position. Godfrey claims he was further subjected to harassment, including false statements regarding his job performance, and "harsh treatment" due to his sexual orientation. Both sides claimed some degree with of victory with the Court's ruling, with Godfrey calling it "a decision that is really going to help Iowans who are impacted by improper government actions going forward," and counsel for former Governor Branstad praising the justices for leaving affirmative defenses intact once the matter ultimately goes to trial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Connecticut Governor <a href="http://portal.ct.gov/governor/">Dannel Malloy</a> [official website] <a href="http://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/Press-Room/Press-Releases/2017/06-2017/Gov-Malloy-Signs-Legislation-Furthering-the-States-Efforts-to-Combat-the-Opioid-Crisis">signed</a> [press release] a bill into law on Friday which takes aim at the state's ongoing opioid epidemic. Calling the widespread epidemic "a complex crisis that does not have one root cause, nor... a simple solution," Mallow had <a href="http://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/Press-Room/Press-Releases/2017/01-2017/Gov-Malloy-Proposes-Legislative-Package-to-Further-the-States-Efforts-Combating-Opioid-Addiction">initially introduced</a> [press release] the legislation, now codified as <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2017/ACT/pa/pdf/2017PA-00131-R00HB-07052-PA.pdf">Public Act 17-131</a> [text, PDF], in January. After months of debate and amendment, the state <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/house.asp">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/h/2017HV-00279-R00HB07052-HV.htm">unanimously passed</a> [vote count] the legislation on May 31, and the <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/senate.asp">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/s/2017SV-00308-R00HB07052-SV.htm"> did the same</a> [vote count] a week later. The governor says that the new law, among other things, will increase data sharing among state agencies regarding opioid abuse, facilitate the destruction of unused medicine, require electronic prescriptions, allow patients to voluntarily indicate that they do not want to be prescribed opioids, and reduce the length of opioid prescriptions to minors from seven days to five days. Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman says the new law will help "curb the opioid epidemic - and prevent new victims." Wyman added:</p>

<blockquote>It is part of a bigger strategy to address addiction and recovery so our residents can live healthier, more productive lives. I applaud the Governor and the legislature for their commitment to a healthier state.</blockquote>

<p>The opioid crisis has risen to the level of a national epidemic in recent years, in turn eliciting a variety of responses from different authorities across the nation. Last week, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/missouri-ag-suing-opioid-manufacturers.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against three of the largest opioid manufacturers, <a href="http://www.purduepharma.com/about">Purdue Pharma</a>, <a href="https://www.jnj.com/about-jnj">Johnson & Johnson</a> and units of <a href="http://www.endo.com/about-us">Endo International Plc.</a> [corporate websites], accusing them of violating consumer protection laws by deliberately and carefully crafting a "campaign of deception." Two weeks ago a bipartisan group of state attorneys general from Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas announced <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/state-attorney-generals-investigate-opioid-drug-companies.php">joint investigations</a> [JURIST report] into the marketing and sales practices of the manufacturers of opioid painkillers. In March <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] establishing a task force to combat the opioid crisis. This would not be the first time that opioid drug manufacturers have found themselves in trouble with the law. In July 2007 the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pharma.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1185030508-pdFqUnDAEbi6OEAMOlKLXg">sentenced</a> [NYT report] three former executives of the Purdue Frederick Company, manufacturer of painkiller <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111085.htm">OxyContin</a> [FDA materials], to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service in drug treatment programs. The three executives, including former president Michael Friedman, former chief in-house counsel Howard Udell, and former medical director Paul Goldenheim, all <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oxycontin-maker-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 to a misdemeanor offense of misbranding a drug. Prosecutors had alleged that the company and executives were aware in 1995 that doctors were concerned about the drug's high addiction risk, but its sales representatives continued to misrepresent OxyContin's effects to physicians. Purdue Frederick agreed to pay $634.5 million in fines for its role in misleading the public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday the <a href="https://ssu.gov.ua/en/pages/89">Security Service of Ukraine </a>(SBU) [official website] accused a recent cyber attack on Russia and the Kremlin. The SBU <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40471310">stated</a> [BBC report] that the hackers behind the most recent attack are the same as those who conducted an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA">attack</a> [Reuters report] on the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016. Experts worldwide are still trying to decide who was behind the most recent attack which took out computers, disrupted shipping, and hit banks across the globe. Some experts are unsure if the Russians are the ones behind the attack, as Russian oil companies <a href="http://www.gazprom.com/">Gazprom</a> and <a href="https://www.rosneft.com/">Rosneft</a> [corporate websites] both reported that they were affected by the attack. There was a minor ransom demand for $300, but it has been concluded that financial enrichment was not the purpose behind the attack. The SBU <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-ukraine-idUSKBN19M39P">stated</a> [Reuters report] that "the main purpose of the virus was the destruction of important data, disrupting the work of public and private institutions in Ukraine and spreading panic among the people". While purpose of the recent attack was directed against financial institutions, it quickly spread to other sectors. </p>

<p>Cyber warfare continues to be one of the most common kinds of attack being used by countries in the current day and age. Russia has been accused for many of the attacks, which has led to repercussions across the globe. In May Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ukraine-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-tech-companies.php">imposed sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against a handful of Russian tech companies in retaliation for cyber attacks, raising the total number of firms sanctioned to over 400. Though many attacks are difficult to pinpoint who was the actual culprit, there are typically signs of where the attacks originated. In May cyber security researchers believe that the found indicators pointing to North Korea being behind an <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/security-researchers-north-korea-possible-source-of-wannacry-cyber-attack.php">attack</a> [JURIST report] in May that affected over 300,000 computers across the globe. The most published cyber attack in the recent past was the alleged Russian attempt to disrupt and influence the American election. In March the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-charges-russian-officers-for-hacking-email-accounts.php">announced indictments</a> [JURIST report] against four Russian individuals in connection with the hacking of email accounts. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom (UK) government on Sunday announced its withdrawal from a fishing arrangement made with other countries allowing them to fish within the UK waters. The <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/entri/texts/acrc/fish64.txt.html">London Fisheries Convention</a> [text], originally signed in 1964, allowed Irish, Dutch, French, German, and Belgian ships to fish within six tothe  twelve nautical miles of each other's coastlines.  According to Environment Secretary <a href="https://www.michaelgove.com/about-michael">Michael Gove</a> [official profile], the  withdrawal will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/02/uk-take-back-control-london-fisheries-convention-michael-gove">allow</a> [Guardian report] the UK to take back control of fishing waters, regulate future fishing stocks and establish the UK as an "independent coastal state" since its withdrawal from the European Union (EU). Due to the withdrawal, UK ships will also lose the right to fish in waters six to twelve nautical miles offshore from the other countries. </p>

<p>In March the<a href="https://www.parliament.uk"> UK Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brexit-bill-passed-making-way-for-the-uk-to-leave-the-eu.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/europeanunionnotificationofwithdrawal.html">Brexit bill</a> [text] which announced UK's plan to withdrawal from the EU and began the negotiation process. The process to leave the convention will take about two years. That same month, UK High Court judges <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/british-judges-dismiss-legal-challenge-to-brexit.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] that claimed members of parliament should be allowed to vote on whether Britain will leave the European Economic Area. In June, the majority of UK voters had <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">expressed their desire</a> [JURIST report] to leave the EU causing the resignation of former prime minster David Cameron.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US and Britain urged the Russian government on Friday to further the investigation into the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. Five Chechan men were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nemtsov-britain-idUSKBN19L2ND">convicted</a> [Reuters report] on Thursday for the murder of the opposition politician. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/06/272311.htm">statement</a> [press release] hailing Nemstov as a "champion of democracy" and stated:<blockquote>We welcome the news that five of the persons responsible for the murder of Boris Nemtsov have been convicted of the crime. We call once more on the Russian Government to ensure that all involved in the killing of Boris Nemtsov, including anyone involved in organizing or ordering the crime, are brought to justice.</blockquote> A spokesperson for Britain's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-call-for-investigation-into-murder-of-boris-nemtsov-to-continue">offered the department's support</a> [press release] for "Boris Nemtsov's family in their call for a fuller investigation into who ordered his murder." The five convicted men, Anzor Gubashev, Shagid Gubashev, Zaur Dadayev, Ramzan Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/nemtsov-murder-trial-begins-in-russia-military-court.php">confessed</a> [JURIST report] to the crime but later retracted their confessions and now claim innocence. Nemtsov had previously served as prime minister and was since known as a prominent liberal political activist. In February 2015 he was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061">shot in the back four times</a> [BBC report] in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was a known critic of Vladimir Putin and openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine. </p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In May an Austrian man was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/austrian-man-extradited-for-war-crimes-in-eastern-ukraine.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from Poland to Austria to face war crimes charges for allegedly killing civilians and surrendering troops while fighting for the Ukrainian army. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation plans to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. Last July Amnesty International and Human Rights released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">have subjected citizens to</a> [JURIST report] "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. In December 2015 the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia.  In March of same year the EU committed to stand by its policy of refusing to recognize <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="https://www.casd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court of Southern California</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Calif.Guns_.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] on Friday to stop California from implementing a ban against high capacity gun magazines. In 2016 California citizens approved <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2016/Prop63-110816.pdf">Proposition 63</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits the possession of firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Citizens who were already in legal possession of the magazines had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/30/federal-court-enjoins-california-large-capacity-magazine-confiscation/?utm_term=.cc5a6052e1c5">four options</a> [WP report]: remove them to another state, surrender them to a law enforcement agency, sell to a licensed firearm dealer or spend up to one year in jail. In his opinion, Judge Roger Benitez stated: <blockquote>The Court does not lightly enjoin a state statute, even on a preliminary basis. However, just as the Court is mindful that a majority of California voters approved Proposition 63 and that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting the public from gun violence, it is equally mindful that the Constitution is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. Plaintiffs' entitlements to enjoy Second Amendment rights and just compensation are not eliminated simply because they possess "unpopular" magazines holding more than 10 rounds.</blockquote><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/about">Attorney General Xavier Becerra</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-statement-court-decision-high-capacity-magazine-ban">statement</a> [press release] saying, "Restricting large capacity magazines and preventing them from ending up in the wrong hands is critical for the well-being of our communities."</p>

<p>California has been the center of much of the country's gun law controversies. In April the <a href="https://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] filed the <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nra-files-challenge-to-california-gun-control-legislation.php">first complaint </a>[JURIST report] in a planned series of challenges to new California gun control laws put in place following the San Bernardino attack. In February a federal judge ruled that gun rights advocates are allowed to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-gun-rights-advocates-can-publish-lawmakers-information.php">publish personal information</a> [JURIST report], such as addresses and telephone numbers, of legislators who voted in favor of California's recent gun control laws. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/federal-appeals-court-upholds-california-waiting-period-for-gun-purchases.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to California's 10-day waiting period for purchasing a gun. Also in December California's 5th District Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/california-court-remands-challenge-to-gun-microstamping-law.php">reversed and remanded</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling which rejected a challenge to a state law requiring gun microstamping. Last July California Governor Jerry Brown signed 20 bills into law, six of which were bills <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/california-governor-signs-gun-control-laws.php">altering the gun laws</a> [JURIST report] in the state</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Peru <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.pe/?K=1">Congress</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.pe/index.php?K=263&id=8785/noticias/COMISIÓN-PERMANENTE-APROBÓ-REMOCIÓN-DEL-CONTRALOR#.WVung7pFxvw">unanimously voted </a> [press release] to remove the Comptroller, Edgar Alarcon, from office. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-politics-idUSKBN19O26R?il=0"> vote </a> [Reuters report] to remove Alarcon was initiated over accusations that he gave public funds to the mother of his children, violated ethical rules by running a business while in office, and coerced an auditor to withhold information from Congress. Alarcon has denied any wrongdoing and claims that his removal was a tactic designed to distract the people from the government's mistakes. Although Alarcon was dismissed, audits that were started under his guidance will continue to be executed. After the vote to remove Alarcon, Peruvian opposition leader Keiko Fujimori wrote a letter to President Pablo Kuczynski asking him to meet and open a dialogue about issues facing Peru such as the economy and corruption. It is unclear whether the President accepted this invitation or not.</p>

<p>Corruption is an issue that has been plaguing the Peruvian government. In February, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/peru-judge-orders-arrest-of-former-president.php"> ordered </a> [JURIST report] the arrest of former president Alejandro Toledo for his alleged involvement with a bribery scandal involving the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht SA. The arrest of Toledo came only days after the Attorney General made it public that he sought the <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/perus-attorney-general-seeks-arrest-of-former-president.php"> arrest </a> [JURIST report] of Toledo for laundering of assets and influence trafficking. In July 2016, former president Alberto Fujimori made a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-peru-leader-makes-another-presidential-pardon-request.php"> presidential pardon request </a> [JURIST report] for the incumbent President Kuczynski. Fujimori was currently serving a 25 year prison sentence for human rights abuses during his ten year rule. Fujimori was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/peru-ex-president-fujimori-convicted-of.php"> convicted </a> [JURIST report] of the human rights abuses by a special court in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Florida Governor Rick Scott on Monday <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/03/535411557/florida-governor-schedules-an-execution-after-year-and-a-half-hiatus"> scheduled </a> [npr report] the execution of Mark Asay which will be the state's first execution in nearly two years. The execution of death row inmates in Florida had been halted after their sentencing procedure was deemed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-7505_5ie6.pdf">unconstitutional</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Supreme Court. Initially the sentencing system involved a jury that recommended the sentence with a judge that was free to disregard the recommendation in finalizing the sentence. The procedure has since been <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/280/BillText/er/PDF"> amended </a> [bill, PDF] in an attempt to fix the defects. A unanimous jury decision is now required for a recommendation of the death penalty. The execution of Asay is scheduled to take place on August 24.</p>

<p>The death penalty has become an increasingly controversial issue in recent years. In June, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ohios-execution-delay.php"> reversed </a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision and found Ohio's execution protocol to be constitutional. In that same week, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php"> ordered </a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Earlier in June, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php"> ruled </a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May, the Delaware House of Representatives passed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php"> bill </a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php"> new bill </a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury was signed into law in March. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php"> refused </a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Advocate General of the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website], Maciej Szpunar, on Tuesday <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-07/cp170072en.pdf">declared</a> [press release] that EU member states were entitled to "prohibit and punish the illegal exercise of a transport activity such as UberPop without having to notify the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">[European] Commission</a> [official website] of the draft law in advance." Uber France firmly argues that the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.1998.217.01.0018.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:1998:217:TOC">France law</a> [text] "constitutes a technical regulation which directly concerns an information society service within the meaning of the directive on technical standards and regulations," thereby requiring EU members to notify the Commission of any draft law or rules placing technical regulations on these types of services. Uber France maintains it cannot be prosecuted because the French authorities did not provide such advance notfication. Szpunar disagreed, stating in a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=192325&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=689829">non-binding opinion</a> [text] that services such as the UberPop service, which provides a transportation service through non-professional private drivers using their own vehicles, can be prohibited and punished by member states without notifying the Commission of the draft law, because the UberPop service is not an information society service. Szpunar added that even if UberPop is held to be an information society service:</p>

<blockquote>prohibiting and punishing the activity of an intermediary, such as Uber, in the illegal exercise of a transport activity does not constitute a "technical regulation" within the meaning of the directive, with the result that notification of the draft law to the Commission would not be necessary in that situation either .... if every national provision that prohibited or punished intermediation in illegal activities had to be regarded as a technical regulation me rely because the intermediation most likely takes place by electronic means, a great number of internal rules in the Member States would have to be notified as technical  regulations. That would lead to an unwarranted extension of the obligation to notify ...</blockquote>

<p>The advocate general's decision is not binding on the ECJ, which will make a final ruling on the case later this year.</p>

<p>This is the latest in <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>'s [corporate website] legal troubles worldwide. In May, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">issued a non-binding opinion</a> [JURIST report] finding that Uber is a transportation company subject to all local rules, regulations, and fines of the jurisdictions they enter, similar to other taxi services. Four days later, the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-uber-engineer-removed-from-project-in-waymo-suit.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an Uber engineer, who allegedly stole information from self-driving technology company <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a> [corporate website] before becoming employed at Uber, removed from the self-driving division of the company. Earlier the same month, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/reuters-doj-conducting-criminal-investigation-of-uber-for-avoiding-law-enforcement.php">announced it had launched a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the company for using a software tool that helped drivers evade local transport regulators. In January the US <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/uber-ordered-to-pay-20-million-for-misleading-recruitment-information.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Uber Technologies agreed to pay $20 million to settle a claim that the company had engaged in misleading tactics to recruit new drivers. In December Uber was <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in Denmark for assisting drivers in violating taxi laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, Judge Milton Hirsch found that <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/128/BillText/er/PDF">SB 128</a>, the law in question, violated art. II § 3 of the <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Constitution">Florida Constitution</a> [text], which prohibits one branch of government from exercising powers confined to another branch. According to Hirsch, the legislative changes in question shifted the burden of persuasion concerning self-defense claims to prosecutors, and also elevated the required standard of proof. Hirsch found these changes to be procedural, which according to art. V § 2(a) state constitution, only the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] has authority to enact. Hirsch added:<blockquote>The legislative changes at issue here purport to alter in two ways the burden of proof at a "Stand Your Ground" hearing. The burden of persuasion is shifted from the movant&#8212;the criminal defendant claiming immunity&#8212;to the state. And the quantum of proof is altered from mere preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence. Because questions of burden of proof are procedural rather than substantive, however, I necessarily find the demised legislative changes to be unconstitutional.</blockquote><a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4503">Richard Corcoran</a> [official profile], the Republican Speaker of the <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/default.aspx">Florida House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-guns-idUSKBN19O2HY">criticized the ruling</a> [Reuters report] stating that "It is the role of the legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights ... The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense."</p>

<p>"Stand Your Ground" laws have been the subject of much controversy and have been scrutinized heavily. In November, the <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/study-finds-florida-stand-your-ground-law-associated-with-increased-homicide-rates.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number of homicides in Florida increased "significantly" since the passing of the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0776/Sections/0776.013.html">Stand Your Ground law</a> [text] in 2005. In June 2012, Florida created a commission to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/florida-begins-its-investigation-into-self-defense-law.php">review such self-defense laws</a> [JURIST report]. Twenty-three states in the US have enacted a variation of the stand your ground law. The law does not require someone who reasonably believes themselves to be threatened or in immediate danger to retreat but rather allows the use of deadly force. The law has been criticized for its vagueness and potential for bias-based use against minorities. In April 2012, Rev. Markel Hutchins, a civil rights activist, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/activist-challenges-georgia-no-duty-to-retreat-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] challenging the state's "No Duty to Retreat" law because it is too vague and can lead to misuse of killing minority members. Hutchins also declared that his challenge derived from the killing of Trayvon Martin. Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/georgia-shoot-first-law-takes-effect.php">enacted</a> its "No Duty to Retreat" law in 2006 while Florida <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/gun-opponents-to-campaign-against-new.php">enacted</a> [JURIST reports] its "stand your ground" law in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A86B20D79BEB893E85258152005CA1B2/$file/17-1145-1682465.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 2-1 that the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] cannot suspend a rule requiring oil and gas companies to fix and reduce methane leaks in their equipment. In June the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-06/documents/oil_and_gas_2-year_stay_frn2.pdf">proposed staying the rule</a> [text, PDF] but acknowledged "that the environmental health or safety risk addressed by [the] action may have a disproportionate effect on children." The EPA intended to postpone implementation of the rule for two years. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said that the agency needed to reconsider the rule and give industry groups sufficient time to comment. The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/">National Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC) [advocacy website] as well as other environmental justice groups <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/emergency-motion-for-stay.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [motion, PDF] asserting that Pruitt lacked the authority to invoke reconsideration and delay implementation. The court stated that the EPA had ample opportunity hear comments on all relevant issues and that the decision to impose the stay was "arbitrary and capricious." The Director of the NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program, David Doniger, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/media/2017/170703">said</a> [press release], "The ruling recognizes that EPA lacks the authority to simply scrap these critical protections. And it shows the courts are going to enforce the rule of law on health and environment. The Trump Administration's war on the environment and our health has hit a brick wall." The court concluded that the ruling does not preclude the EPA from reconsidering the rule providing the new policy is permissible under all relevant statutes.</p>

<p>Many environmental other groups have expressed serious concerns over Pruitt's appointment as the new head of the EPA. In April <a href="http://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/environmental-groups-ask-appeals-court-to-order-epa-pesticide-ban.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] that asked the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to order the EPA to ban a widely used pesticide after Pruitt denied a petition to prohibit its use. In February, Pruitt <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/epa-chief-promises-aggressive-rollback-of-obama-regulations.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] to cut back EPA regulations, saying the agency's Clean Power Plan, Waters of the US rule, and the US Methane rule will all be targets under the Trump administration. Pruitt's nomination for head of the EPA was met with consternation from Democrats, who cited Pruitt's numerous lawsuits against the EPA while he was the Oklahoma Attorney General. Days before his confirmation by the Senate, Pruitt was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/oklahoma-judge-orders-epa-head-to-release-e-mails.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge to release thousands of emails between the Oklahoma AG office and various fossil fuel companies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two UN human rights experts have <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21841&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN report] Virginia <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] to halt the planned execution of a man with psychological disabilities. William Morva, a US Hungarian national, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a hospital security guard and a Sheriff's deputy in 2008. A court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed Morva with delusional disorder and believes that he may have committed the murders due to delusions he was experiencing. According to the experts, Morva did not receive "reasonable accommodations" during his trial. Under the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/ConventionRightsPersonsWithDisabilities.aspx">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [materials] reasonable accommodation means "necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms." Additionally, the jury was not informed about Morva's condition. The two experts are asking authorities to "annul the death sentence against Mr. Morva and to re-try him in compliance with international standards related to due process and fair trial."</p>

<p>Recently the death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Earlier this week Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/florida-governor-orders-first-execution-in-over-18-months.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] the execution of Mark Asay which will be the state's first execution in nearly two years. The execution of death row inmates in Florida had been halted after their sentencing procedure was deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. In June a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ohios-execution-delay.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision and found Ohio's execution protocol to be constitutional. In that same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Earlier in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury was signed into law in March. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armed groups have been committing war crimes in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/CFIndex.aspx">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [UN materials], according to a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/05/killing-without-consequence/war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity-and-special">report</a> [summary] released Wednesday by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] detailing violence in three central provinces between November 2014 and April 2017. During that time period, HRW documented at least 566 civilian deaths at the hands of the Seleka and anti-balaka groups. Armed groups also destroyed no fewer than 4,207 homes, forcing people to flee the area and causing the deaths of 144 children and elderly people. Those responsible for the deaths have not been "detained, arrested or otherwise held accountable" and are still free to roam the areas where their crimes occurred. In addition to seeking international support for improved civilian protection, the report also asks the UN and other individual governments to back the Special Criminal Court (SCC) financially and politically. Although President Faustin-Archange Touadéra has praised the SCC, the government has "lagged in steps to operationalize" it. The SCC, an institution within the CAR's justice system with international judges and prosecutors, has the "unique chance to hold accountable the perpetrators of these grave crimes."</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president François Bozize in March 2013. In June a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-expert-car-must-act-to-protect-citizens.php">warned</a> [JURIST report]  that the CAR "must act now" to protect its population and implement justice. In May a report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights claimed that human rights violations within the CAR <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-report-human-rights-violations-in-car-may-be-war-crimes.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In January Amnesty International reported that perpetrators of war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-unpunished-war-crimes-in-car-call-for-rebuilding-of-justice-system.php">have not been prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] or investigated for their crimes. The rights organization urged that the country's justice system needs to be reconstructed and a Special Criminal Court, tasked with trying suspected war criminals, and a witness protection program must be established. In November UNICEF called for aid to approximately <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php">1.2 million children distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poland's special prosecutors have requested the US extradite a Minnesota man accused of Nazi war crimes. Michael Karkoc, 98, is a former commander of an SS-led Nazi unit <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/minnesota/articles/2017-07-04/poland-moves-toward-extradition-of-us-man-in-nazi-case">responsible for</a> [AP report] burning Polish villages and killing civilians during World War II. The request for extradition was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/poland-us-extradition-nazi-massacre-second-world-war-michael-karkoc-ss-a7825231.html">filed last month</a> [Independent report] by the <a href="https://ipn.gov.pl/en">National Remembrance Institute</a> (IPN) [official website]. Although records do not show that Karkoc had a direct hand in war crimes, documentation, including his own memoirs and statements from other men in his unit, suggests he was present and supervised the atrocities. A <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/poland-asks-us-extradite-minnesota-resident-accused-nazi-war-crimes-631800">previous attempt</a> [Newsweek report] to extradite Karkoc to Germany was dropped when his lawyer provided documentation showing he was unfit to stand trial. According to his family, Karkoc is suffering from advance Alzheimer's disease. He denies any involvement in war crimes.</p>

<p>Efforts to seek justice and restitution for the victims of the Nazi Germany era are still underway, over 70 years after the close of World War II. Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/index.de.html">Austria Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/austrian-court-government-acted-legally-in-seizing-home-where-hitler-was-born.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government seizure of the apartment complex where Nazi leader <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adolf-Hitler">Adolf Hitle</a>r [Britannica profile] was born is constitutional. In May Romania <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/romania-enacts-legislation-enabling-restitution-for-holocaust-survivors.php">enacted legislation</a> [JURIST report] enabling restitution for Holocaust survivors. In November 2016 the Germany Federal Court of Justice [official website, in German] upheld [JURIST report] the conviction of former Nazi SS Officer <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32336353">Oskar Groening</a> [BBC profile], known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," for his role in the deaths of over 300,000 people during the Holocaust. Two months earlier the Neubrandenburg state court in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-begins-trial-of-95-year-old-former-ss-medic.php">started the trial of a 95-year-old former SS medic</a> [JURIST report] who served at the Auschwitz camp. The same month a court in Kiel, Germany, ruled that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-rules-92-year-old-woman-unfit-to-stand-trial-for-auschwitz-deaths.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. Prior to 2011 German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/germany-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-nazi-officer.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7998947.stm">John Demjanjuk</a> [BBC profile] may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Colorado-based watchdog group, the Coalition for Good Governance, and six Georgia voters <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/voting-atlanta.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday to throw out the most recent election results for the Georgia House of Representatives. The June 20 election was a race between Republican <a href="https://karenhandel.com/">Karen Handel</a> and Democrat <a href="https://electjon.com/">Jon Ossoff</a> [campaign websites]. Handel won with 52 percent of the votes. Voters used electronic, touchscreen voting ballots, as opposed to paper ballots. The lawsuit calls out major security problems with the voting system, as well as problems concerning verifiability. The named defendants in the lawsuit were Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, members of the State Election Board, local election officials in Fulton, Cobb and DeKalb counties, and the Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University. </p>

<p>Voting rights, on both the national and state level, have been an issue in the US for decades and voting issues have gone to court in many states in just the past year. This lawsuit comes after Superior Court Judge Kimberly Esmond Adams threw out a lawsuit earlier this month that sought to prevent the election from using electronic ballots. In May the US Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in an Ohio voting case. Also in May, the Maine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/maine-supreme-court-finds-state-ranked-candidate-voting-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's newly enacted legislation providing for a ranked-choice voting system conflicted with the state's constitution. In March seven convicted felons filed <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-ex-felons-file-class-action-suit-over-voting-rights-laws.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging Florida's process of restoring voting rights to felons is unconstitutionally arbitrary. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) [advocacy website] filed <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/voting/pacei/EPIC-v-Commission-complaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday and has <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/voting/pacei/EPIC-v-Commission-TRO-motion-and-memorandum.pdf">sought</a> [text, PDF] temporary injunctive relief against the Trump administration's request for voter information. EPIC alleges that the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (PACEI) failed to preform a Privacy Impact Assessment prior to the commencement of its conduct. EPIC also claims that the request has the potential to violate the constitutional right to privacy. According to the group, the website state officials are directed to, to fulfill the request is <a href="https://epic.org/2017/07/in-voter-privacy-case-epic-fil.html">unsecured</a> [press release]. Further, the information demanded by PACEI could enable identity theft. </p>

<p>Trump established PACEI in May via  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/presidential-executive-order-establishment-presidential-advisory">executive order</a> [text] . Last week, PACEI Vice Chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach sent out a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/06.28.17_Kobach_Letter_to_States.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] requesting voter information from all 50 states. The letter asks the states to provide the names, dates of birth, addresses, political affiliation, and last four social security digit of its registered voters. So far, 44 states have at least partially refused the demand. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French judge Catherine Marchi-Uhel was <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sga1744.doc.htm">appointed</a> [press release] as Head of the International Impartial and Independent Mechanism on Monday to collect evidence concerning persons involved in Syrian war crimes over the last six years. Marchi-Uhel has experience in criminal law, transitional justice and human rights, and worked for the UN concerning various international affairs. Marchi-Uhel will gather evidence and prepare cases concerning suspected war crimes contributors, with the goal of taking the cases to trial.  </p>

<p>This past December, the General Assembly created the Mechanism under resolution 71/248, describing it as the "International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011." The Mechanism is <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-senior-judge-or-prosecutor-to-head-syria-war-crimes-investigation.php">primarily charged</a> [JURIST report] with "collecting, consolidating, preserving, and analyzing" evidence of human rights violations, and facilitating and expediting independent criminal proceedings in accordance with standards of international law. The Mechanism will work closely with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria</a> [official profile], which was established by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese court has ordered a mental hospital to issue a public apology and pay compensation to a 38-year-old man after forcing him to undergo conversion therapy. The man was committed to the institution by his wife in 2015. He was subjected to forced medication and injections for 19 days after being diagnosed with "sexual preference disorder." The court's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/07/03/world/asia/ap-as-china-gay-therapy.html">ruling</a> [AP report] turned on the fact that the man did not pose a danger to himself or others and did not take a stance on the practice of conversion therapy itself. </p>

<p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. In June the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted </a>393-226 [JURIST report] to legalize same-sex marriage. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna charged <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act . A day earlier Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General António Guterres to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter, about 100 gay and bisexual men were detained, tortured, murdered or went missing under the authority of Chechen officials. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website] issued an <a href="http://ia600506.us.archive.org/12/items/gov.uscourts.mtd.47868/gov.uscourts.mtd.47868.155.0.pdf">injunction</a> [order, PDF] on Wednesday to stop the construction of a $59 million dam that threatened the habitat of an ancient fish species in Montana's Yellowstone River, three months after he lifted a similar injunction on the order. A wood-and-rock irrigation dam <a href="http://missoulian.com/montana-untamed/montana-dam-blocked-again-over-threat-to-endangered-fish/article_d078cb19-f143-5ea9-820f-7ec0d0520afb.html">currently blocks</a> [AP report] the <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=E06X">long-snouted pallid sturgeon</a> [species profile], a species that has evolved very little since the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago, from their spawning grounds. The pallid sturgeon takes over 15 years to mature and reproduces infrequently with up to 10-year intervals between spawns. Their numbers have dwindled to about 125 wild fish due to man-made dams and channels. The <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official website] proposed a new dam that included a bypass channel for the fish, but two wildlife conservation groups, <a href="http://www.defenders.org/courts/conservation-law">Defenders of Wildlife</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC) [advocacy websites], successfully sued to block the project arguing that there was little evidence to show the fish would use the bypass channel. After the <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/">US Bureau of Reclamation</a> and the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/">US Fish and Wildlife Service</a> [official websites] conducted a more thorough analysis showing that approximately 41 percent of the fish would use the channel, Judge Brian Morris <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/montana/articles/2017-04-19/judge-in-endangered-fish-lawsuit-lifts-hold-on-montana-dam">lifted the ban in April</a> [AP report] to allow the project to proceed. The two conservation groups filed new claims contending that the analysis failed to show the long-term effects the low numbers would have on the overall population. The agencies involved will now reconvene and decide how to proceed on the time-sensitive project.</p>

<p>The conservation of endangered species has been a growing concern during the Trump administration. Many advocacy groups, including the NRDC, have been working to fight several deregulations and rollbacks that threaten the environment in recent months. Earlier this week the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-epa-attemps-to-postpone-protections-against-methane-leaks.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 2-1 that the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] cannot suspend a rule requiring oil and gas companies to fix and reduce methane leaks in their equipment after the NRDC and other environmental groups filed a lawsuit. In June the NRDC joined 11 states in <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/11-states-sue-trump-administration-over-energy-efficiency-regulations.php">filing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that sought to compel the <a href="https://energy.gov/">Department of Energy</a> (DOE) [official website] to publish efficiency standards. Several environmental groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/environment-groups-sue-administration-over-keystone-xl-pipeline.php">filed lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] against the Trump administration in March over the <a href="http://www.keystone-xl.com/">Keystone XL pipeline</a> [corporate website]. In February the NRDC <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/lawsuit-filed-against-epa-over-mercury-discharge-rule-recission.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing the EPA of illegally rescinding a rule that reduced the discharge of mercury from dental offices. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2017_04402.PDF">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Thursday that South Africa violated its obligation by failing to arrest Sudanese President <a href="http://sudan.gov.sd/index.php/en">Omar Al-Bashir</a> [official website] when he visited the country in 2015. Two <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2009_01514.PDF">arrest warrants</a> [text, PDF; <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2010_04826.PDF">second warrant</a>, PDF] have been issued for Al-Bashir involving <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/darfur/albashir/pages/alleged-crimes.aspx">numerous charges</a> [materials] including "crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of genocide." South Africa contended that because Al-Bashir has immunity from criminal proceedings under customary international law that had not been waived in Sudan the court was precluded from compelling South Africa to detain and surrender him. Although the Chamber disagreed, it declined to refer the country to the UN Security Council because doing so "would not foster cooperation." Additionally, South African domestic courts had found that the government had breached its "obligations under its domestic legal framework by not arresting Omar Al-Bashir and surrendering him to the Court." Because the South African Government has withdrawn an appeal against the domestic court's ruling, the Chamber concluded that the government "has accepted its obligation to cooperate with the Court." </p>

<p>There has been significant criticism of the Sudanese government and the conflict in the Darfur region. Since 2003 the region has faced civil unrest from conflict between the government and rebel groups.

In January the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and international sanctions Idriss Jazairy <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-praises-us-decision-to-lift-sanctions-on-sudan.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] former US president Barack Obama's recent decision to lift all US sanctions on Sudan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/">New Zealand Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday formally apologized to the hundreds of men who were criminally convicted under antiquated anti-homosexuality laws. The country's House of Representatives <a href="https://twitter.com/NZParliament/status/882830258180956160/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.nz%2Fen%2F">stated</a> [Twitter account] that it apologizes "to those homosexual New Zealanders who were convicted for consensual adult activity, and recognize[s] the tremendous hurt and suffering those men and their families have gone through, and the continued effects the convictions have had on them." Lawmakers also unanimously approved the first stage of a <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2017/0274/latest/DLM7293253.html">bill</a> [materials] that "provides an expungement scheme for convictions for a historical homosexual offense if the conduct constituting the offense, if engaged in when the application for expungement was made, would not constitute an offense under the laws of New Zealand." Under the bill, approximately 1,000 men will be able to have their convictions quashed. New Zealand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/07/06/world/asia/ap-as-new-zealand-homosexual-convictions.html?_r=0">decriminalized</a> [AP report] homosexuality in 1986 and legalized same-sex marriage four years ago. The bill provides no entitlement to compensation regardless of any fines or losses incurred from the conviction.</p>

<p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. Earlier this week a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/china-court-finds-for-gay-man-in-conversion-therapy-case.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a mental hospital to issue a public apology and pay compensation to a 38-year-old man after forcing him to undergo conversion therapy.  In June the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted 393-226</a> [JURIST report] to legalize same-sex marriage. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. A day earlier Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General António Guterres to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter, about 100 gay and bisexual men were detained, tortured, murdered or went missing under the authority of Chechen officials. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU and Japan formally agreed upon an outline on Thursday for a free-trade deal between two of the world's largest economic powers. Although the deal still requires further negotiations, it is <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/eu-and-japan-strike-free-trade-deal.html">expected</a> [AFP report] that 99 percent of trade deals between Japan and the EU will be liberalized. Additionally, the outline <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40520218">calls for</a> [BBC report] the two entities to cooperate on other issues such as fighting climate change. Japanese Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19725705">Shinzo Abe</a> [BBC profile] met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels, Belgium on the eve the G20 summit meeting to sign the deal which has been in planning stages since 2012. The deal gained momentum due to an increase in protectionist policies and the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-withdrawing-from-trans-pacific-partnership.php">withdrawal</a> [JURIST report] of the US from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/tpp-explained-what-is-trans-pacific-partnership.html">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) [NYT backgrounder]. Japan and other Asia-Pacific members of the TPP <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/japan-and-other-countries-to-move-forward-with-tpp-despite-us-withdrawal.php">agreed to move forward</a> [JURIST report] with their deal despite the US backing out. Proponents of the deal between Japan and the EU hope it will send a clear message that many highly-developed democracies are still committed to free trade partnerships that will benefit a global economy.</p>

<p>International trade involving the US has been a point of contention under the Trump administration. The move to withdraw from the TPP represented a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/trump-to-withdraw-from-trans-pacific-partnership-on-first-day-in-office.php">fulfillment of a campaign promise</a> [JURIST report] for Trump, and a repudiation of one of former president Barack Obama's most ambitious accomplishments, <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-house-passes-compromise-trade-bill.php">first passed in June of 2015</a> [JURIST report]. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/trade-deals-working-all-americans">statement</a> [text] on the official White House website suggests that the president intended to use a threat of similar withdrawal from <a href="https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/Home/Texts-of-the-Agreement/North-American-Free-Trade-Agreement">NAFTA</a> [official website] to renegotiate the trade deal with Canada and Mexico. In May Robert Lighthizer sent a letter [JURIST report<a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-confirms-renegotiation-of-nafta.php"></a>] to Congress communicating the Trump administration's intention to begin the process of renegotiating. However, concerns remain that withdrawing or threatening to do so from such trade deals such like the TPP could ultimately be to the nation's detriment long term; Senator John McCain issued a <a href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=75B5FF88-7343-427C-BC95-E2D4960E8B3B">statement</a> [text] concerning the TPP cancellation, calling it a "serious mistake" that will have "lasting consequences" for America's economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/Paginas/default.aspx">Constitutional Court of Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/NotasDePrensaDocumentos/NP_2017_049/NOTA%20INFORMATIVA%20N%2049-2017.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] Wednesday that provisions of the Catallan budget that allocated funds to the upcoming independence referendum are illegal. The court <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-court-bans-catalonia-funding-independence-vote-out-of-budget/">held</a> [Politico report] that any funds allocated to financing the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/catalonia-votes-to-pursue-independence-referendum.php">October 1 referendum</a> [JURIST report] are unconstitutional and therefore void. The ruling aligned with the Madrid government's strong opposition to Catalian independence. The Spanish government continues to argue that not only does the Spanish Constitution not allow for secession, but that funds intended for the referendum would be used illegally. </p>

<p>The Catalonia independence movement has gathered momentum in recent years following the economic crisis in the country that began in 2008. In 2015 the Constitutional Court of Spain <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/spain-court-declares-catalonia-independence-plan-unconstitutional.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] a resolution by the Parliament of Catalonia that proposed a plan for the region's independence from Spain by the end of this year. In September of 2015 the High Court of Justice of Catalonia <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/catalonia-president-summoned-to-court-over-2014-independence-referundum.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia President Artur Mas over his involvement in the 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/catalonia-president-summoned-to-court-over-2014-independence-referundum.php">independence referendum</a> [JURIST report]. In 2014 Mas <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/catalonia-president-signs-decree-calling-for-referendum-on-independence-from-spain.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] calling for a referendum on secession and independence from Spain, inciting confrontation from Spain's central government in Madrid. In February 2014 Spain's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/spanish-parliament-rejects-catalonia-independence-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia's proposed referendum, which asked voters if they wanted Catalonia to become a state, and, in the case of an affirmative response, if they wanted this state to be independent. When Catalonia proceeded with the referendum, the Constitutional Court held the independence vote to be <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-top-court-declares-catalonia-independence-vote-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/veasey-doj-remedies.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] Thursday urging a judge for the <a href="www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] to dismiss a challenge to changes to <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB14">Texas' 2011 voter ID law</a> [materials], which was found to be <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rules-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">discriminatory against minority voters</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ argued that Texas' <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB5">Senate Bill 5</a> [materials] made changes to the 2011 law that remedied the original discrimination concerns. The brief states: <blockquote>As a matter of bedrock principles of federalism and comity, the United States (in bringing enforcement actions) and this Court (in deciding cases) must defer to any "constitutionally and legally valid" legislative remedy that was "enacted by the appropriate state government unit" to address the violations that the Court found.</blockquote>Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos will decide whether a challenge to the amended legislation can continue.</p>

<p>Since being signed into law in 2011 by former Governor Rick Perry, the original voter ID law has been a contentious issue for the Texas legislature, citizens and the judiciary. In February the DOJ introduced a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/doj-reverses-position-in-texas-voter-id-law-claim.php">withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the case, reversing its original stance that the bill was created with discriminatory intent. In January the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] declined to <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] involving the law. In September a federal judge ordered Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-judge-orders-texas-to-revise-voter-id-education-materials.php">revise its voter ID materials</a> [JURIST report], as it had been found to not comply with an order to relax the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italy's <a href="http://en.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website] approved a bill on Wednesday to outlaw certain forms of torture. The new law <a href="https://www.partitodemocratico.it/sicurezza/reato-tortura-finalmente-leggenessuna-tortura-restera-impunita/">defines</a> [press release, in Italian] torture as "acts, single or repeated, causing suffering and trauma such as to harm the dignity of a person, already deprived of their liberty" by a public official or anyone else responsible for the victim's well-being. The bill was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-torture-idUSKBN19Q2SQ">passed</a> [Reuters report] by a vote of 198 to 35, with many on the left abstaining. Italy's center-left <a href="https://www.partitodemocratico.it/">Democratic Party</a> [party website, in Italian] supported the bill, which the party says will leave no torture unpunished and brings Italy's definition of torture in line with the UN. Italy's center-right party fears that the new law will make it more difficult for the military and law enforcement to perform their duties. However, on the left, many feel that the law did not go far enough by excluding some forms of torture from the definition. <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.it/legge-sulla-tortura-in-discussione-alla-camera-dichiarazione-di-amnesty-international-italia/">said</a> [press release] last week that the law was "confusing and restrictive."  </p>

<p>Torture is one of the most controversial issues facing the international community. Last month UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-violations-in-burundi.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over human rights violations in Burundi, including torture. That same month a Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/guantanamo-detainee-files-suit-against-psychologists-who-devised-interrogation-tactics.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the psychologists who devised interrogation tactics. In May a UN report <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-report-reveals-extensive-human-rights-violations-in-sudan.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] excessive violence and torture in South Sudan. In April Human Rights Watch called for an <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the torture of gay and bisexual men in Chechnya. As of March, the International Criminal Court was exploring the <a href="/forum/2017/03/benjamin-davis-icc-torture.php">possibility</a> [JURIST commentary] of prosecuting Americans for torture allegedly carried out in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Morva was executed by lethal injection Thursday after supporters failed to convince Virginia Governor <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] to grant him clemency because of a mental illness. Morva, a US Hungarian national, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a hospital security guard and a Sheriff's deputy in 2008. A court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed Morva with delusional disorder and believes that he may have committed the murders due to delusions he was experiencing. Earlier this week two UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/un-urges-governor-to-halt-execution.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] McAuliffe to halt the planned execution. According to the experts, Morva did not receive "reasonable accommodations" during his trial nor was the jury informed of his condition. McAuliffe, despite being personally opposed to the death penalty, <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=20611">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>I have determined that Mr. Morva was given a fair trial and that the jury heard substantial evidence about his mental health as they prepared to sentence him in accordance with the law of our Commonwealth. In short, the record before me does not contain sufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary step of overturning the decision of a lawfully empaneled jury following a properly conducted trial.</blockquote> Three of Virginia's Congressional representatives and two dozen members of the state's General Assembly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/va-governor-declines-to-halt-execution-of-killer-whose-mental-illness-spurred-clemency-bid/2017/07/06/a1b4f4ba-5b4c-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html?utm_term=.1a4570bd3813">opposed</a> [WP report] the execution.</p>

<p>Recently the death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Earlier this week Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/florida-governor-orders-first-execution-in-over-18-months.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] the execution of Mark Asay which will be the state's first execution in nearly two years. The execution of death row inmates in Florida had been halted after their sentencing procedure was deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. In June a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ohios-execution-delay.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision and found Ohio's execution protocol to be constitutional. In that same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Earlier in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury was signed into law in March. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.hid.uscourts.gov/index.cfm?pid=0&mid=1">US District Court for the District of Hawaii</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://lyldenlawnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ExO-Hawaii-order-7-6-17.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] the state's attempt to exempt grandparents from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a>'s [official profile] travel ban. The state asked Judge Derrick Watson to interpret the scope of a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] last month and was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-releases-guidelines-for-travel-ban-implementation.php">further defined</a> [JURIST report] by the administration a week later. The Supreme Court's order permits execution of the travel ban, but it "may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States." Watson wrote in his opinion that the district court would not "usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court." He stated: <blockquote>Upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions, it is evident that the parties quarrel over the meaning and intent of words and phrases authored not by this Court, but by the Supreme Court in its June 26, 2017 per curiam decision. That is, the parties' disagreements derive neither from this Court's temporary restraining order, this Court's preliminary injunction, nor this Court's amended preliminary injunction, but from the modifications to this Court's injunction ordered by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>According to a <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/07/07/17-16366%20Order.pdf">court filing</a> [order, PDF], Hawaii plans to appeal the district court's ruling.</p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the federal judiciary. In June the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. Also in June the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier that same month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">granted a temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal appeals court upholds First Amendment right to film police</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/files/2014/9944/4450/Fields__Geraci_3d_Cir_Opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that citizens have a First Amendment right to record police performing their duties. The court found that officers, "are public officials carrying out public functions, and the First Amendment requires them to bear bystanders recording their actions. This is vital to promote the access that fosters free discussion of governmental actions." The court was clear that this case was based on a First Amendment right to access of information about how public servants operate in the public realm. This decision follows the rulings by the First, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits. Even with the ruling in favor of the First Amendment argument, two of the three judges ruled that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity, effectively shielding them from liability over the incidents. </p>

<p>Trust between communities throughout the US and police officials continues to be an issue, particularly after a series of incidents have led to demand for higher accountability from the public servants. The interactions have created dialogues in communities in an attempt to create a greater trust between members of the public and law enforcement. In April the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/doj-raises-doubts-on-baltimore-police-reform-agreement.php">raised doubts</a> [JURIST report] about a police reform agreement reached in the city of Baltimore. In June rights group decided that they wanted police reform and through a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/rights-groups-sue-chicago-seeking-police-reform.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] attempted to bring about the change and accountability over the Chicago police enforcement practices. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court allows enforcement of Wisconsin fetal protection law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070717zr_8m58.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] Friday allowing enforcement of Wisconsin's fetal protection law. The law gives courts jurisdiction over an "unborn child" and "expectant mother" when the mother "habitually lacks self-control" in the use of alcohol and drugs "to a severe degree," creating a substantial risk to the health of the child. The district court <a href="http://advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/Loertscher%20SJ%20Opinion.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] had found that the law was overly vague and issued an injunction. The Supreme Court will hear an appeal of the case to decide a final outcome. Two justices said they would have kept the injunction in place pending the appeal. </p>

<p>Abortion in America continues to be one of the most contentious issues throughout many states in the Union. In June in the state of Ohio lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-senate-votes-to-ban-common-method-for-second-trimester-abortions.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 24-9 in favor of a bill that would criminalize a common second trimester abortion procedure. The day prior the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-san-francisco-law-on-deceptive-advertising-from-anti-abortion-clinics-.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a San Francisco ordinance on Tuesday that was implemented to halt deceptive advertising tactics employed by clinics opposed to abortion. Also in June the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">barred doctors</a> [JURIST report] from suing state over abortion law, holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN member states voted 122-1 Friday to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57139#.WWEIkCkpDIV">adopt</a> [UN News Centre report] the first ever multilateral legally binding treaty on nuclear disarmaments. The one vote against the adoption of the <a href="/paperchase/Draft%20UN%20Treaty%20on%20the%20Prohibition%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons.docx">Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</a> [text, WORD] came from the Netherlands, while Singapore was absent at the conference. Among other things, the treaty prohibits 1) the developing, testing, production, manufacture, acquisition, possession, stockpiling, or transfer or receipt of nuclear weapons; 2) the use or threat to use nuclear weapons directly or indirectly; 3) the assistance, encouragement or inducement of anyone, or seeking assistance in any way from anyone to engage in any nuclear-weapons-related activity prohibited under the treaty; or 4) any stationing, installation or deployment of any nuclear weapons in the member state's territory or at any place under its jurisdiction or control. The treaty also requires declarations from member states concerning prior or current possession of nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons facilities, and a declaration that the concerned country will eliminate all such weapons and/or facilities before becoming a party to the treaty. The treaty also has various other provisions such as safeguards, environmental remediation, international cooperation and assistance, settlement of disputes, and withdrawal from the treaty. Calling the treaty "an important step and contribution towards the common aspirations of a world without nuclear weapons," <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary General António Guterres</a> [official website] hoped that it would encourage dialogue and cooperation in the international community in progressing toward complete nuclear disarmament. However, all nuclear-armed nations (China, France, India, North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, US and UK) and some of their allies boycotted the conference and stayed out of the negotiations. In a joint press statement, the US, UK and France stated that they "do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to" the treaty and that the treaty "clearly disregards the realities of the international security environment. ... Accession to the ban treaty is incompatible with the policy of nuclear deterrence, which has been essential to keeping the peace in Europe and North Asia for over 70 years." The treaty will be open for signature for all member states in the UN Headquarters in New York on September 20 of this year, and will enter into force 90 days post ratification by a minimum of 50 countries. </p>

<p>Development and promotion of nuclear weapons programs and stockpiling of nuclear weapons continue to raise international concern. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-to-start-negotiations-to-ban-nuclear-weapons.php">voted to begin</a> [JURIST report] negotiations for this treaty in October, despite opposition votes from world leaders including the US, Russia and the UK. Toward the end of May, a UN panel <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-panel-releases-draft-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the draft treaty above in Geneva. Last month, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-security-council-passes-sanctions-against-individuals-and-groups-to-north-korea-sanctions-list---.php">expand existing sanctions</a> [JURIST report] placed on North Korea and applied those sanctions to 14 individuals and four organizations. In May, JURIST Guest Columnist and former State Department official James Rudolph discussed the <a href="/hotline/2017/05/James-Rudolph-north-korea-nukes.php">consequences of waiting</a> [JURIST op-ed] for North Korea to use its nuclear weapons. In November, <a href="https://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website] Director General Yukiya Amano said that <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/iaea-iran-repeatedly-failing-to-keep-nuclear-commitments.php">Iran has repeatedly failed</a> [JURIST report] to keep its stockpile of heavy water below 130 metric tons. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/heavy-water">Heavy water</a> [Britannica backgrounder] can be used for nuclear energy or for the development of nuclear weapons. In October, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-court-refuses-to-hear-marshall-islands-case-against-india-over-nuclear-arms.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to hear a claim by Marshall Islands that the world's nuclear powers failed to halt the nuclear arms race. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/minister/honourable-chrystia-freeland">Chrystia Freeland</a> and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness <a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/bt/mnstr-en.aspx">Ralph Goodale</a> [official profiles] issued a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2017/07/statement_of_apologytomromarkhadr.html">joint statement</a> [text] on Friday apologizing to former Guantánamo detainee Omar Khadr for violating his rights under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> (Charter) [text]. Freeland and Goodale's statement read:<blockquote>Today, we are announcing that the Government of Canada has reached a settlement with Mr. Omar Khadr, bringing this civil case to a close. On behalf of the Government of Canada, we wish to apologize to Mr. Khadr for any role Canadian officials may have played in relation to his ordeal abroad and any resulting harm. We hope that this expression, and the negotiated settlement reached with the Government, will assist him in his efforts to begin a new and hopeful chapter in his life with his fellow Canadians. The details of the settlement are confidential between Mr. Khadr and the Government.</blockquote>The government has refused to confirm the details of the settlement, but various media sources reported that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/canada/omar-khadr-apology-guantanamo-bay.html">amount of the settlement</a> [NYT report] was approximately $10.5 million (Canadian). <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/andrew-scheer/">Andrew Scheer</a> [official profile], leader of Canada's conservative party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/canada/omar-khadr-apology-guantanamo-bay.html">called the settlement disgusting</a> [NYT report] while <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/07/08/omar-khadr-apology-settlement-was-about-charter-rights-trudeau_a_23022074/">stated</a> [Huffington Post report] that the Charter protects all Canadians "even when it is uncomfortable" and added that "When the government violates any Canadian's Charter rights, we all end up paying for it." Khadr, now 30, said that he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/canada/omar-khadr-apology-guantanamo-bay.html">"really sorry"</a> [NYT report] for the pain he caused, adding that he was "never was angry or upset about" what was done to him.</p>

<p>A severely wounded Khadr was captured by US troops in Afghanistan in 2002 when he was a child soldier at 15 years of age. Khadr is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/canada/omar-khadr-apology-guantanamo-bay.html">only Canadian citizen</a> [NYT report] to have been imprisoned at the US military base in Guantánamo Bay. He had pleaded guilty</a> [NYT report] to using a hand grenade against US soldiers Christopher Speer and Layne Morris. Speer died in the incident, while Morris partially lost his eyesight. This apology concerned Khadr's interrogation by Canadian government officials post his capture. Khadr was transferred to Canada in 2012, and he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/canada-court-rules-khadr-may-be-released-on-bail.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] in May 2015. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-canadas-release-of-child-soldier-is-a-significant-step.php">stated of Khadr's release</a> [JURIST report] at the time that Canada was taking a "significant step toward ending his ordeal." The following week, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] rejected the government's bid to have Khadr declared an adult offender. In September 2015, Justice June Ross of the <a href="https://albertacourts.ca/court-of-queens-bench">Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-judge-relaxes-bail-conditions-for-former-guantanamo-inmate.php">Khadr can visit his family</a> [JURIST report] in Toronto for two weeks and do so without an electronic monitoring bracelet. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/07/07/17-16366%20Order.pdf">dismissed</a> [order, PDF] Hawaii's appeal to challenge the rules of the Trump administration's travel ban. The three-judge panel decided that the court did not have jurisdiction, clarifying that the question should be posed to the US Supreme Court. Hawaii was lodging an attempt to allow grandparents and certain other relatives to be classified as having a "bona fide" relationship, allowing them to come into the US. It is unclear what steps Hawaii might take now that the Ninth Circuit has declined to address the issue. As it stands the only relationships that are classified as bona fide connections are parents, spouses, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, fiances and siblings. </p>

<p>The travel ban has been a contentious topic since the Trump administration first implemented the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">executive order</a> [materials], and continues to face a series of federal legal action. On Thursday a federal judge in Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-denies-hawaiis-attempt-to-exempt-grandparents-from-travel-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the state's attempt to exempt grandparents the ban. In June the US District Court for the Western District of Washington <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. Also in June the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier that same month the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">granted a temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A wounded officer in a <a href="http://time.com/4409654/baton-rouge-police-shooting/">Baton Rouge shooting</a> [TIME report] last year <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/353260864/Federal-lawsuit-against-Black-Lives-Matter-activists#from_embed">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint] in the <a href="https://www.lamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website] Friday alleging that <a href="http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/">Black Lives Matter</a> [advocacy website] and five of its leaders were responsible for inciting violence that led to the attack. The complaint lists a long timeline of events across the country connected to the Black Lives Matter movement and alleges damages greater than $75,000. According to the complaint:<blockquote>At least eleven (11) police have been shot dead and at least nine (9) more wounded by BLM protesters, activists, and/or supporters. The leaders of BLM and Defendants, not only, incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death of black men shot by police, but also did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police. In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war.</blockquote>Black Lives Matter leaders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-louisiana-police-lawsuit-idUSKBN19S2TA">have denied</a> [Reuters report] any accusations that their movement promotes violence against police officers.</p>

<p>This suit comes a year after the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/aclu-and-other-bodies-sue-baton-rouge-police-department.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the Baton Rouge police department for violating the First Amendment rights of protesters who were peacefully protesting the police killing of Alton Sterling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday extended his <a href="https://cbsdetroit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/order-extending-stay.pdf">ruling</a> [order, PDF] that Iraqi nationals with orders to leave the US cannot be deported for another two weeks. The order temporarily blocks the deportation of more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals until July 24. The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the Iraqi nationals, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/us/iraqi-deportation-stay-extended/index.html">cited </a> [CNN report] "fears of persecution, torture or even death upon return to their country." The US attorney general had argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the issue, instead arguing that it should be up for the immigration courts to decide. </p>

<p>Many of the individuals affected by this temporary stay to deportation have failed to attain travel documents from the Iraqi government because they refused to grant them papers. This ruling continues a stay of the deportation order to protect 1,444 Iraqi immigrants from deportation, first <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/michigan-federal-judge-blocks-immediate-deportation-of-more-than-1400-iraq-immigrants.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] in June. In March <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] reached an agreement with Iraq to allow the country to allow deportees in <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/22/534038340/federal-judge-in-michigan-halts-deportation-of-iraqis-who-fear-torture">exchange</a> [NPR report] for removing Iraq from the list of banned countries. The country continues to argue over the legality of implementing the travel ban, though it seems that the country will finally have a ruling on the issue in the coming months. In June the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> [court website] agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">review</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration's travel ban, partially lifting the temporary injunction that had blocked the ban's enforcement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Venezuelan political prisoner <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26238612">Leopoldo López</a> [BBC profile] was released from a military prison Saturday on house arrest after the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice <a href="https://twitter.com/TSJ_Venezuela/status/883655306789736449">ordered his release</a> [Twitter page, in Spanish] due to health concerns. López has been detained by the government since early 2014 on a 13-year sentence after being charged with inciting anti-government protests. Venezuela has been facing anti-government protests for <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/venezuela-marks-100-days-unrest-glance-article-1.3312299">100 days</a> [AP report], and the release of López has raised hopes for the opposition. He was briefly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/world/americas/venezuela-leopoldo-lopez-political-prisoner.html">seen</a> [NYT report] in front of his home on Saturday kissing the Venezuelan flag but making no remarks to supporters as per the conditions of his release.</p>

<p>Venezuela's government has faced significant tension in its treatment of political opposition, especially López. The EU Council in May <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/eu-council-calls-for-venezuela-elections-following-unrest.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners and hold elections to end the violent protests in the country. A Venezuelan appeals court in Caracas in April 2016 <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/venezuela-court-upholds-sentence-of-opposition-leader.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] López's sentence. In March of that same year, Venezuela's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-legislature-passes-an-amnesty-for-dozen-of-jailed-dissidents.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amnesty law that would free 77 individuals allegedly jailed for political reasons under a number of crimes such as the instigation of violence or commission of treason, but the President vowed to veto the law. In November 2016 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-urges-protection-for-venezuela-opposition-after-assassination.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the protection of political opposition leaders associated with an assassinated Venezuelan opposition leader while he was on state with López's wife, Lilian Tintori. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] has published a <a href="https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw9212.pdf">decision</a> [order, PDF] that Philip Morris must pay substantial legal fees to the Australian government for a failed suit the tobacco company brought concerning cigarette packaging laws. In 2011 Australia, the UK and other countries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/philip-morris-cigarettes-charged-millions-after-losing-plain-packaging-case-against-australia">replaced</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packages with graphic health warnings. After a six-year legal battle fighting the new packaging regulations, Philip Morris lost its claim for damages. Philip Morris argued that Australia's claim for costs related to arbitration was "unreasonable" as the country's legal team primarily consisted of public servants. Australia contended that the amount requested was a small proportion of the amount of damages sought by Philip Morris in the initial suit. The exact amount rewarded was omitted from the order. In similar cases against the tobacco giant, the US and Canada claimed $4.5 million and $3 million respectively. </p>

<p>Cigarettes continue to be a serious health and legal issue around the world. In May 2016 the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/">EU Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/eu-top-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-rules.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] EU rules that will require health warnings to cover 65 percent of a cigarette pack. In June 2015 a judge for the Quebec Superior Court awarded over <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/canada-court-orders-tobacco-companies-to-pay-billions-in-damages.php">$15 billion</a> [JURIST report] in damages to Quebec smokers in a case against tobacco companies JTI-Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, making this the largest award for damages and the biggest class action lawsuit in Canada's history. In May 2014 the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-suits-against-tobacco-companies.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a consolidated lawsuit brought against various tobacco companies. In August 2014 the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website]<a href="/paperchase/2014/08/world-health-organization-calls-for-strong-regulation-of-electronic-cigarettes.php">called for strict regulation</a> [JURIST report] of electronic cigarettes, including a ban on the usage of the devices in public places and advertising targeting minors. In June 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/thailand-court-approves-graphic-warnings-on-cigarette-packages.php">approved a new regulation</a> [JURIST report] requiring packs of cigarettes in the country to be 85 percent covered with graphic health warnings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London's <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Monday that the UK can continue to export arms to Saudi Arabia. The <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a> (CAAT) [advocacy website] brought the suit <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-caat-british-arms-trade-785232910">on the grounds</a> [AFP report] that the weapons have been used to violate International Humanitarian rights laws. For the last two years, Saudi Arabia has been waging attacks on Yemen causing the deaths of over ten thousand civilians. Several advocacy groups, including <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites], intervened in the suit. The court looked at a range of evidence, including secret information that was not released to the public due to security concerns. A substantial portion of Lord Justice Burnett's reasoning is contained in a "closed judgment" document that is only available to the government's legal team and a security-cleared "special advocate" for CAAT. Andrew Smith, a spokesman for CAAT, <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/media/press-releases/2017-07-10">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>This is a very disappointing verdict, and we are pursuing an appeal. If this verdict is upheld then it will be seen as a green light for government to continue arming and supporting brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia that have shown a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law.</blockquote>Burnett said he would consider the appeal but at the present time "there was no clear risk that there might 'be serious violations' of International Humanitarian Law" compelling the court to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Supplying arms to countries in wartime has been an international concern in recent years. The Federal Court of Canada in January <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/canada-court-permits-saudi-arms-deal.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to block the Canadian government from selling arms to Saudi Arabia. In November 2016 Human Rights Watch called on the US to <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-calls-on-us-to-stop-selling-bombs-to-saudi-arabia.php">halt the sale of weapons</a> [JURIST report] to the government of Saudi Arabia. The call came days after the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced a <a href="http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/government-saudi-arabia-air-ground-munitions">Foreign Military Sale</a> [press release] estimated at $1.29 billion for air-to-ground munitions. The DOD stated that weapons are being exhausted by Saudi forces in counter-terrorism operations and the sale will help the country defend itself against threats from adversaries in the future. However, according to HRW, Saudi airstrikes in Yemen may be violations of laws of war. In March 2016 two human rights groups called for the US, the UK and France to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-urge-countries-to-stop-selling-arms-to-saudi-arabia.php">stop selling arms</a> [JURIST report] to Saudi Arabia due to accusations and evidence that the weapons are being used in attacks against Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/american-civil-liberties-union-v-donald-trump-complaint">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday against President Donald Trump's election commission for lack of accountability in violation of federal law. The <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=128410">Federal Advisory Committee Act</a> [text, PDF] was created to ensure that all advisory committees were accountable to the public regarding procedure and operation. The ACLU's complaint accuses the administration of violating provisions of the Act in place to ensure that commissions are transparent to the public. Specifically, the complaint charges the "Pence-Kobach Commission" with violating two requirements of the Act: (1) the non-discretionary transparency and public access requirement, and (2) the public access requirement. <blockquote>The Pence-Kobach Commission has already held its first meeting without public notice; without making that meeting open to the public; and without timely notice in the Federal Register, §10(a). It has also failed to make any of its &#8220;records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by&#8221; the Pence-Kobach Commission &#8220;available for public inspection."</blockquote>Trump created the Commission on Election Integrity through an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/president-announces-formation-bipartisan-presidential-commission">executive order</a> [the White House, official statement], stating: "we can't take for granted the integrity of the vote. This bipartisan commission will review ways to strengthen the integrity of elections in order to protect and preserve the principle of one person, one vote because the integrity of the vote is the foundation of our democracy." President Trump's suspicion of voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election motivated the formation of this commission. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights experts: Israel should reconsider charges against Palestinian human rights defender</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two UN rights experts said Monday that Israel should reconsider the charges it is pursuing against Issa Armo, a Palestinian human rights defender. The Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Michael Lynk, and the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, Michel Forst, made a joint statement in favor of Israel dropping <a href="https://www.protecting-defenders.org/en/news/un-human-rights-experts-call-israel-reconsider-charges-against-palestinian-activist-issa-amro">charges</a> [Protecting Defenders report] against Armo, stating: "on the information available to us, many of the charges against Mr. Amro appear to be directed squarely at his lawful right to peacefully protest against the 50-year-old Israeli occupation. ... The non-violent work of human rights defenders must not be disrupted and attacked by the authorities, even under a military occupation." Forst and Lynk went on to say Armo already faced enough punishment in the past through harassment, discriminatory treatment, intimidation, and physical intimidation with military groups. The experts' request calls on Israel to "abide by international human rights laws in its dealings with human rights defenders." </p>

<p>Last month Human Rights Watch alleged that Israel has occupied the West Bank through human rights abuses for the past <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/human-rights-watch-fifty-years-of-human-rights-violations-in-west-bank.php">50 years</a> [JURIST report]. In May the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-about-palestinian-prisoner-hunger-strike.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the treatment of hunger striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. In April the UN Secretary-General, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">expressed his discontent</a> [JURIST report] with Israel's latest decision to build settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and repeated his previous calls for a two-state solution to resolve the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In March Israel's Security Cabinet voted unanimously to approve the first settlement in the West Bank in more than <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/israel-approves-first-new-west-bank-settlement-in-20-years.php">20 years</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.national-assembly.org.kh">Cambodia's National Assembly</a> [official website, in Cambodian] on Monday passed a <a href="http://www.national-assembly.org.kh/&prev=search">bill</a> [official press release, in Cambodian] which prohibits political parties from being affiliated with convicted criminals. Commentators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/cambodia-passes-bill-tightening-screws-on-opposition/2017/07/10/3648bdba-652e-11e7-94ab-5b1f0ff459df_story.html?utm_term=.ba6d3cf3fcea">believe</a> [WP report] the law is aimed at weakening the opposition <a href="http://www.cnrp7.org/en/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP) [party website]. The party's former leader, Sam Rainsy, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38944741">recently resigned</a> [BBC report] from the party after he was sentenced to two years in prison on defamation charges. As a result of the new law, Rainsy will no longer be able to be affiliated with the CNRP in any manner. The CNRP gained significant political strength in the 2013 Cambodian elections when the party took a  total of 55 seats in the National Assembly, leading some to believe the defamation charges against Rainsy were politically motivated. </p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have caused international concern.

A Bahrani court ordered his release in December 2016, but shortly after his release he was arrested on the current charges. Rajab was sentenced to two years in prison for the political opinions he expressed during interviews in 2015 and 2016. Salil Shetty, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/profiles/salil-shetty/">Amnesty International's Secretary General</a> [official profile], condemned the conviction as a brazen violation of human rights. Rajab is still facing numerous charges in cases expected to resume on August 7. </p>

<p>Bahrain has had their human rights record questioned multiple times in recently. In June a Bahrain court dissolved a major political party that has opposed the current government, an act that AI <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/amnesty-accuses-bahrain-of-taking-step-towards-total-suppression-of-human-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] is a step towards total suppression of human rights. In March Bahrain's upper house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would allow military trials for civilians accused of being involved in terrorism plots. In September 2015 32 nations <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/bahrains-human-rights-record-criticized-by-32-countries.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] a statement to the UN urging Bahrain to protect freedom of peaceful assembly and speech, and to investigate reports of torture used on prisoners. In April 2015 a human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-bahrain-government-reforms-have-failed-to-end-rights-violations.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Bahrain's post-2011 reforms had failed to put a stop to human rights violations including illegal detentions and torture. And in February 2015 the Bahrain Ministry of the Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">started</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation against a political opposition group for allegedly illegal content posted on social media</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] on Tuesday upheld a Belgian ban on wearing the niqab, a full-face veil, in public spaces. The court dismissed two cases, <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/?i=001-175141">Belcacemi and Oussar v. Belgium</a> and <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-175139">Dakir v. Belgium</a> [judgments, in French], that asserted the ban was in violation of Articles 8, 9, 10 and 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Both cases concerned women who chose to wear the veil of their own volition and felt the ban was discriminatory and without a "legitimate aim." The court rejected the claims that the ban violated a right to private life under the Convention <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/Judgment%20Belcacemi%20and%20Oussar%20v.%20Belgium%20-%20ban%20on%20wearing%20face%20covering%20in%20public%20areas%20%28Law%20of%201%20June%202011%29%20%281%29.pdf">finding</a> [press release] that it "could be regarded as proportionate to the aim pursued, namely the preservation of the conditions of 'living together' as an element of the 'protection of the rights and freedoms of others'." In <span class="casename">Dakir</span>, the court found that the <a href="http://english.conseil-etat.fr/"><em>Conseil d&#8217;État</em></a> [official website] had infringed Dakir's right of access to a court under Article 6 by ruling a previous application to annul the ban inadmissible and awarded her 800EUR for costs and expenses. </p>

<p>Full-coverage veils have been the recent subject of legislation and adjudication in Europe. In April the <a href="http://hunconcourt.hu/az-alkotmanybirosag-szervezete">Constitutional Court of Hungary</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hungary-constitutional-court-repeals-village-ban-on-burkas.php">repealed a village ban</a> [JURIST report] on the construction of mosques as well as headscarves like burkas and chadors worn by Muslim women. In February Bavaria <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/bavaria-approves-partial-ban-on-full-face-veil.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on full-face veils in certain public spaces. Later that month the <a href="http://www.msb.gov.tr/">Turkish Ministry of Defense</a> [official website, in Turkish] announced that female soldiers will be allowed to wear headscarves along with their uniforms. In December German Chancellor Angela Merkel on <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/germany-chancellor-endorses-partial-ban-on-full-face-veils.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on burqas and niqabs, saying that "the full facial veil is inappropriate and should be banned wherever is legally possible." Also in December the Netherlands legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/Netherlands-legislature-votes-in-favor-of-partial-burka-ban.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a partial burka ban. However, in July the EU's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/eu-court-backs-french-woman-dismissed-for-wearing-head-scarf.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a French woman who was fired for wearing a head scarf.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.sci.gov.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] on Tuesday suspended a government ban on cattle trading for the sole purpose of slaughter. In May Prime Minister <a href="http://www.narendramodi.in/">Narendra Modi</a> [official website], a Hindu nationalist, decreed that cattle trade could only be conducted for agricultural purposes such as dairy production and plowing. Cows are considered holy in Hinduism and their slaughter had been previously banned in most of the country. The new regulations put forth in May <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40565457">expanded the ban</a> [BBC report] to include the slaughter of buffaloes and camels. The leather and meat industries, which brings in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-politics-meat-idUSKBN19W0IH?il=0">more than $16 billion</a> [Reuters report] in annual sales, are run by minority Muslims who claim the ban was implemented to marginalize them. The ban spurred several attacks on Muslims involved in the cattle industries including the deaths of 28 people. The court stressed the hardships the ban would incur upon those who rely upon the meat and leather industries. The government plans to modify and reissue the order in light of the court's decision.</p>

<p>The issue of cow slaughtering has been a major issue in India. In May The Supreme Court of India <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/india-top-court-rejects-petition-seeking-nationwide-ban-on-cow-slaughter.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a public interest litigation seeking an all-India ban on cow slaughter. In August of last year, approximately 36 beef dealers associations across Maharashtra filed a petition in the top court <a href="http://www.india.com/news/india/supreme-court-dismisses-pil-seeking-complete-ban-on-cow-slaughter-in-every-state-1787755/">challenging the ban on cow slaughter</a> [India.com report]. The petitioners in the case reasoning with the court that cattle after the age of 16 are too old for other activities and therefore should be permitted to be put to slaughter. Earlier that same year, the state government banned the slaughtering of bulls, bullocks and cows through an amendment to the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/259288934/Maharashtra-Animal-Preservation-Amendment-Act-2015">Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act</a> [text]. In May the <a href="http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/">Bombay High Court</a> [official website] upheld that provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> [website] users blocked by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] filed a <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3892179/2017-07-11-Knight-Institute-Trump-Twitter.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Tuesday alleging the the action is a violation of their <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights. The group, represented by the <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/">First Knight Amendment Institute and Columbia University</a> [official website], argue that Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">account</a> [Twitter profile] serves as a public forum that "has become an important source of news and information about the government, and an important public forum for speech by, to, and about the President" and individuals who are "blocked from the account are impeded in their ability to learn information that is shared only through that account." Those filing the suit assert that the Trump administration's blocking of Twitter users who have criticized the President's policies is an unconstitutional viewpoint-based restriction and an "effort to suppress dissent". The complaint cites the Supreme Court's recent decision in <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-sex-offender-social-media-restrictions-unconstitutional.php">Packingham v. North Carolina</a> [JURIST report] which stated that social media platforms like Twitter are "perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard" and that they have become "the modern-day public square." </p>

<p>Opponents of the lawsuit contend that Trump's account is personal and not an official government outlet. The complaint rebuts this argument by citing several occasions that the President used his Twitter account as a formal channel of communication. Earlier this month Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/881281755017355264">stated</a> [Tweet], "My use of social media is not Presidential - it&#8217;s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL." In June he <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/872419018799550464?lang=en">announced his nomination</a> [Tweet] of Christopher A. Wray for Director of the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website]. Also in June Trump made a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-uses-london-attack-to-support-travel-ban.php">series of tweets</a> [JURIST report] to profess the need for his travel ban stemming from the London attack. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As a condition of protection under the decree, FARC members turned over their personal firearms as verified by the UN mission in Colombia. Other conditions of the decree are aimed are reincorporating FARC members into community life.</p>

<p>The Colombian government and the FARC reached a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/colombia-government-and-farc-rebels-reach-new-peace-deal-after-referendum-rejection.php">peace agreement</a> [JURIST report] in November to end the guerrilla warfare that has been plaguing the country for more than five decades.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) [official website] <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-rule-ban-companies-using-arbitration-clauses-deny-groups-people-their-day-court/">announced</a> [press release] a new rule Monday, banning mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer agreements. The CFPB explained that mandatory arbitration agreements can prevent class action lawsuits and perpetuate harmful practices. The new rule will enforce the consumer's right to take part in group lawsuits. The CFPB hopes that the rule will promote more transparency and accountability for large companies. The CFPB will also place additional requirements for documentation and reporting measures for when companies do undergo arbitration. </p>

<p>The CFPB has been part of legal headlines over the last year. In February the New York Attorney General and the CFPB filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/legal-advance-company-accused-of-scamming-911-first-responders-nfl-players.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against RD Legal Funding, LLC and founder/owner Roni Dersovitz for allegedly scamming 9/11 first responders and NFL concussion victims out of money intended to cover medical costs, lost income and other critical personal needs. In January the CFPB initiated a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/largest-servicer-of-us-student-loans-facing-lawsuits.php">suit </a> [JURIST report] against Navient, the largest servicer of US student loans. In September the CFPB <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/consumer-agency-fines-wells-fargo-us-100-million.php">announced</a> [JURIST report]  a $100 million fine against banking giant Wells Fargo for widespread illegal sales practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/index.html">British Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0090-judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] on Wednesday that a gay retiree's husband is entitled to the same pension benefits a wife would enjoy regardless of when payment into the program began. John Walker filed the suit against his employer, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/3644551Z:LN-innospec-ltd">Innospec Ltd</a> [company profile], when they refused to pay his pension in the event of his death to his husband because his service predated December 5, 2005, the date the UK started legally recognizing civil partnerships. While the court acknowledged that the "general rule, applicable in most modern legal systems, is that legislative changes apply prospectively" in order to provide legal certainty, it looked to the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>'s (CJEU) [official website] "future effects" principle. The principle makes a distinction between retroactive application of a rule to a situation that was permanently fixed before the rule was enforced and immediate application of a rule to situations that are continuing. The court concluded that because Walker's service is continuing it is subject to immediate application and "that rights established by legislation should be activated at the time that they were stated to exist." Walker's spouse will now be entitled to about 45,000 pounds ($57,800) a year instead of the minimum of 1,000 pounds a year.</p>

<p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. Earlier this month the New Zealand Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/new-zealand-parliament-apologizes-for-homosexuality-convictions.php">formally apologized</a> [JURIST report] to the hundreds of men who were criminally convicted under antiquated anti-homosexuality laws. Also in July a Chinese court has ordered a mental hospital to issue a public apology and <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/china-court-finds-for-gay-man-in-conversion-therapy-case.php">pay compensation</a> [JURIST report] to a 38-year-old man after forcing him to undergo conversion therapy. In June the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted 393-226</a> [JURIST report] to legalize same-sex marriage. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. A day earlier Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General António Guterres to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter, about 100 gay and bisexual men were detained, tortured, murdered or went missing under the authority of Chechen officials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Pennsylvania high school students filed a <a href="https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Parkland-Complaint-Full-with-exhibits.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday alleging their school district discriminated and violated their <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [LII materials] rights by rejecting a proposal for an anti-abortion club. The suit was filed on behalf of the students by the Chicago-based public interest law firm, the <a href="https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/">Thomas Moore Society</a> [advocacy website], against <a href="http://www.parklandsd.org/">Parkland School District</a> [official website]. According to the complaint, the pro-life club, Trojans for Life, was initially denied on the grounds that it was "too political and controversial" but was later rejected because it refused to abdicate rights enjoyed by other clubs such as fundraising and certain off-campus activities. The complaint states:<blockquote>Defendants' conditioning establishment of Trojans for Life as a student club on Plaintiffs' waiver of rights enjoyed by other clubs at PHS, based on the content of the pro-life message of the club, denies Plaintiffs equal access and constitutes content and viewpoint-based discrimination against the pro-life message of the club, in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the [Equal Access Act].</blockquote>The plaintiffs are seeking a permanent injunction against the school's policy of "unfettered discretion" concerning club approval as well as monetary damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p>The topic of abortion continues to be one of the most contentious issues throughout many states in the Union. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-san-francisco-law-on-deceptive-advertising-from-anti-abortion-clinics-.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an anti-abortion health clinic's argument that a San Francisco ordinance violated their First Amendment right to free speech. Also in June in the state of Ohio lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-senate-votes-to-ban-common-method-for-second-trimester-abortions.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 24-9 in favor of a bill that would criminalize a common second trimester abortion procedure. Earlier that month the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">barred doctors</a> [JURIST report] from suing state over abortion law, holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. The same day, Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed a series of abortion regulations into law</a> [JURIST report]. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/1">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. In February the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. In February the Pennsylvania Senate approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-70037-CV0.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a Texas death-row inmate must be provided funds to build a defense against his impending execution. The decision comes two years after the court stayed the execution to consider an appeal that was filed on the grounds that the defendant was denied appointed counsel and funding to hire a mental health expert. Scott Panetti was convicted by the state of Texas for shooting and killing his wife's parents in 1992. Panetti, who has been institutionalized for schizophrenia, insisted on representing himself at trial. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-execution-idUSL1N1K30AF">During trial</a> [Reuters report] he often spoke incoherently and sought to call on John F. Kennedy and Jesus Christ as defense witnesses. He appealed his conviction and death sentence on incompentency claims, but the Texas Court of Criminal appeals denied his application. The Court of Appeals vacated his conviction and remanded the case back to district court to "determine afresh Panetti's competency to be executed." The opinion concluded, "Delivery of the process due protects the prisoner and in doing so protects us all."</p>

<p>Recently the death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Earlier this month William Morva was <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/virginia-executes-inmate-despite-international-pressure.php">executed by lethal injection</a> [JURIST report] after supporters failed to convince Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to grant him clemency because of a mental illness. Also that week Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/florida-governor-orders-first-execution-in-over-18-months.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] the execution of Mark Asay which will be the state's first execution in nearly two years. The execution of death row inmates in Florida had been halted after their sentencing procedure was deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. In June a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ohios-execution-delay.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision and found Ohio's execution protocol to be constitutional. In that same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Earlier in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury was signed into law in March. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Brazilian president Lula da Silva was <a href="http://estaticog1.globo.com/2017/07/12/sentenca_lula.pdf">convicted</a> [ruling, PDF, in Portuguese] Wednesday of corruption and money laundering and sentenced to almost 10 years in prison. Lula da Silva, who was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010, was charged with obtaining USD $1.1 million from a construction company in improvements and expenses for an apartment in exchange for getting the construction company contracts with the state-controlled oil company. He can still appeal his conviction and will not be arrested until he has exhausted his appeal. He had previously announced intentions to run for president next year for the Workers' Party. However, if his appeal fails, Lula da Silva, who is currently 71, will be ineligible to run for office for 19 years.</p>

<p>Brazil has seen a significant amount of corruption charges throughout various levels of government in recent years. The current Brazilian president, Michel Temer, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-federal-police-find-evidence-of-president-receiving-bribes.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of accepting bribes in June. Former president Dilma Rousseff was impeached for <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil's <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers and dozen of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. In March, Brazil's top prosecutor asked Brazil's Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brazil-prosecutor-requests-83-new-investigations-into-petrobras-scandal.php">open 83 more investigations</a> [JURIST Report] into politicians. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesian president Joko Widodo signed a <a href="http://setkab.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Perpu_Nomor_2_Tahun_2017.pdf">decree</a> [text, PDF, in Indonesian] Monday that allows the government to ban radical organizations. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has called the decree troubling, saying it goes against freedom of association and expression. It is believed that the decree is meant to target a group known as Hizbut Tahrir, which calls for Shariah law in Indonesia. Hizbut Tahrir, along with other groups, has been responsible for months of protests in Jakarta against the city's Christian mayor.The government has previously announced that it planned on banning the group. A spokesman for Hizbut Tahrir has stated that they plan to have the decree reviewed by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/asia/indonesia">Indonesia</a> [HRW country report] has been accused several times over previous years of violating human rights. In February 2016 HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-proposed-amendments-to-indonesia-terror-law-threaten-human-rights.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] proposed amendments to Indonesia's law on the "eradication of terrorism."  In October 2015 Amnesty International reported that death row inmates in Indonesia have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-indonesia-death-row-inmates-tortured-denied-counsel.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the right to counsel, beaten and coerced into confessions. In April 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/indonesia-executes-8-convicted-drug-smugglers.php">eight convicted drug smugglers</a> [JURIST report] were executed by firing squad for their part in a smuggling ring. In February 2013 a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-urge-indonesia-to-amend-bill-regulating-organizations.php">called on Indonesia</a> [JURIST report] to amend a bill they claimed would unfairly limit the rights of assembly, speech and religion of private organizations. In November 2012 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-indonesia-to-end-discrimination.php">urged Indonesia</a> [JURIST report] to end discrimination.  In July 2012 an Indonesian cleric was imprisoned for <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/indonesia-cleric-imprisoned-for-violating-blasphemy-law.php">violating</a> [JURIST report] the nation's blasphemy law. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California Representative <a href="https://sherman.house.gov/">Brad Sherman</a> [official website] filed an <a href="http://sherman.house.gov/sites/sherman.house.gov/files/FINAL%20Article%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">article of impeachment</a> [text, PDF] against <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] on Wednesday. The measure accuses Trump of obstructing justice concerning the Russia probe by using "his authority to hinder and cause the termination of such investigation(s) including through threatening, and then terminating, James Comey." Critics of the move believe it is unlikely to succeed in the majority Republican House. Sherman addressed this in a <a href="https://sherman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sherman-introduces-article-of-impeachment-obstruction-of">statement</a> [press release] saying introduction of the articles will have two likely outcomes: <blockquote>First, I have slight hope it will inspire an "intervention" in the White House. If Impeachment is real, if they actually see Articles, perhaps we will see incompetency replaced by care. Perhaps uncontrollable impulses will be controlled. And perhaps the danger our nation faces will be ameliorated. Second, and more likely, filing Articles of Impeachment is the first step on a very long road.  But if the impulsive incompetency continues, then eventually&#8212;many, many months from now&#8212;Republicans will join the impeachment effort.</blockquote>The article is supported by Texas Representative <a href="http://algreen.house.gov/">Al Green</a> [official website] who had previously called for Trump's impeachment on the House floor.</p>

<p>Allegations of Russian connections have been a problem for the Trump administration since the early stages of his presidency. Last month US Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified [JURIST report before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in relation to his alleged ties to Russia and its coordination with President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. When asked why he had initially stated those conversations did not take place, Sessions said that he was flustered by the questioning and misunderstood what was being asked of him. He also said that he did not <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recuse</a> himself from the investigations because of his <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">failure to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] those meetings. In May Former FBI director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/former-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-against-trump-administration.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Earlier in May the committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-intelligence-committee-subpoenas-former-nsa-leader-flynn.php">issued a subpoena</a> [JURIST report] compelling former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to provide documents related to the committee's investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. Also in May former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-ag-yates-tells-senate-she-warned-of-flynn-vulnerability.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that she had warned about Flynn's vulnerabilities to blackmail by Russia less than a week after President Donald Trump assumed office. In March now-former FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the FBI was investigating allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UK publishes Brexit legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] published <a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0005/cbill_2017-20190005_en_1.htm">legislation</a> [materials] Thursday to sever political, financial and legal ties with the EU. The legislation, known as the Great Repeal Bill, will be a significant step towards the country's exit from the EU, which the UK hopes to complete by 2019. The bill will ensure that all EU laws put in place by Parliament will remain in force after the countries exit with the exception of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents">European Communities Act of 1972</a> [materials], the bill which originally made the UK a member of the EU. The British <a href="www.labour.org.uk/">Labour Party</a> [official website] has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/07/13/the-brexit-great-repeal-bill-actually-consolidates-eu-law-into-british/#4fbeb8854517">promised</a> [Forbes report] to oppose the bill until it includes more provisions to protect workers rights. Without the Labour Party's support, the bill is expected to fail.</p>

<p>Reactions to Brexit have been mixed. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, responded by saying, "I will not pretend that I am happy today." Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, claims the split will lead to a significant decrease in Britain's GDP and fears that the Prime Minister will not maintain the protections for job security and living standards secured by the EU. In June a majority of UK citizens <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to leave the EU due to a growing discontent with EU policies, including immigration. Implications of Brexit extend well beyond immigration, however. In March Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon  sent a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/scotland-formally-requests-second-referendum-on-independence-from-uk.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to UK Prime Minister Theresa May formally demanding a second referendum on Scotland's independence from the UK, stating that the removal of UK "not just from EU, but also from the single market" is not a move that the people of Scotland support or voted for, adding that such a move will have significant adverse economic consequences for Scotland. The same month EU President Donald Tusk laid out <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-president-donald-tusk-outlines-future-plans-with-uk-following-brexit.php">early plans</a> [JURIST report] for negotiations with the UK. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2017/D07-12/C:16-3834:J:Flaum:aut:T:fnOp:N:1993613:S:0">upheld</a> [opinion] Wisconsin's <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/111/I/04/3/a">right to work law</a> [statute] on Wednesday.  This law says that unions cannot force workers to "[b]ecome or remain a member of a labor organization [or]... Pay any dues, fees, assessments, or other charges or expenses of any kind or amount, or provide anything of value, to a labor organization."  The plaintiffs, two branches of the <a href="http://www.iuoe.org/">International Union of Operating Engineers</a> [union website], <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-labor-idUSKBN19X34T">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that the law violated the Fifth Amendment because unions could not collect payment for services they were still required to perform even if a worker was not a member. The panel affirmed the lower court's decision that the Wisconsin law was constitutional because a similar Indiana law had previously been ruled constitutional.</p>

<p>Right to work laws have caused significant legal controversy in the US within the past few years. In May a union sought an <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/unions-seek-injunction-on-kentucky-right-to-work-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a Kentucky right to work law.  The Kentucky House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-controlled-kentucky-legislature-passes-controversial-laws-amid-massive-protests.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the right-to-work bill in January. Currently, 28 states have <a href="/feature/2013/12/jshfhfshf.php">right to work laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The US Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-forced-union-dues.php">oral arguments</a> in January 2016 on the First Amendment rights of public school teachers who do not wish to pay union fees, leading to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/split-supreme-court-affirms-ninth-circuit-decision-on-opt-out-policy-for-union-fees.php">plurality decision</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.senate.gov">Senate</a> [official website] introduced new proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628">legislation</a> [materials] Thursday to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill will allow insurance companies already providing policies under the ACA to offer cheaper plans with limited coverage options and contains provisions for providing states with funding for treating opiod addiction. The bill <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-idUSKBN19Y10B">also requires</a> [Reuters reports] providers to give their customers maternity and newborn care, mental health services, perscription drug coverage, and hospitalization and emergency room coverage. The large cuts to the <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov">Medicaid program</a> [official website] contained in <a href="https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/">Senator Mitch McConnell's</a> [official website] previous version of the <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/senate-releases-health-care-bill-proposing-medicaid-cuts-end-to-aca-penalties.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] have been carried over, leading some to believe that as many as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/13/politics/senate-health-care-bill-ted-cruz-amendment/index.html">15 million people</a> [CNN report] will lose Medicaid coverage by 2026. The bill has already been met with opposition from members of the Republican party, leading commentators to believe the bill is likely to fail.</p>

<p>Repealing the ACA has been a significant priority for President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers. In May the US House of Representatives voted 217-213 to repeal portions of the ACA and <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-house-approves-bill-to-repeal-afforadable-care-act.php">replace them</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general filed a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/democratic-ags-file-motion-to-intervene-in-aca-lawsuit.php">intervene</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit that threatens key parts of the ACA. In March an earlier version of the proposed American Health Care Act was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-healthcare-bill-withdrawn-from-congress-due-to-lack-of-votes.php">withdrawn from consideration</a> [JURIST report] after failing to get enough support to pass. Earlier that month, Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/republicans-present-modifications-to-aca-replacement-bill.php">released two amendments </a>[JURIST report] to the AHCA in an effort to appeal to both conservative and liberal critics. Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-senators-propose-first-aca-replacement-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] the initial ACA replacement bill at the end of January. This came after Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-issues-executive-order-seeking-repeal-of-aca.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] aimed at repealing the ACA, shortly after being sworn in. The Senate had prepared for the repealing of the ACA earlier that month when it <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/senate-takes-first-step-to-repeal-acaa.php">voted 51-48 </a>[JURIST report] to prevent the process from being subject to a filibuster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malta's <a href="http://www.parlament.mt/home?l=1">Parliament</a> [official website]  <a href="https://gov.mt/en/Government/Press%20Releases/Pages/2017/July/12/pr171689.aspx">approved</a> [press release] a bill legalizing same-sex marriage on Wednesday, making it the fifteenth country in the EU and the twenty-fifth country in the world to do so. The bill, in making marriage "fully gender neutral" also allows same-sex couples to "adopt or take on their partner's surname without distinction." Malta had only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/13/malta-recently-banned-divorces-until-recently-now-it-has-legalized-same-sex-marriage/?utm_term=.6281287e4a60">legalized</a> [WP report] divorce in 2011. Previously one of the EU's more conservative countries, Malta has been moving in a more liberal direction after the election of <a href="https://opm.gov.mt/en/Pages/Primeminister.aspx">Prime Minister Joseph Muscat</a> [official profile].  </p>

<p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. Earlier this week the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/uk-supreme-court-awards-equal-pension-rights-to-same-sex-spouse.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] equal pension rights to same-sex spouses. Earlier in July the New Zealand Parliament formally <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/new-zealand-parliament-apologizes-for-homosexuality-convictions.php">apologized</a> [JURIST report] to the hundreds of men who were criminally convicted under antiquated anti-homosexuality laws. Also in July a Chinese court has ordered a mental hospital to issue a public apology and pay <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/china-court-finds-for-gay-man-in-conversion-therapy-case.php">compensation</a> [JURIST report] to a 38-year-old man after forcing him to undergo conversion therapy. In June the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 393-226 to legalize same-sex marriage. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. A day earlier Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General António Guterres to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.hid.uscourts.gov/index.cfm?pid=0&mid=1">US District Court for the District of Hawaii</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/hawaii-district-court-grants-part-motion-modify-scope-preliminary-injunction-travel-ban-case">expanded</a> [opinion, PDF] the exemptions permitted under the Trump administration's temporary travel ban on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries late Thursday night. Earlier this month the state of Hawaii asked Judge Derrick Watson to interpret the scope of a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] that was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-releases-guidelines-for-travel-ban-implementation.php">further defined</a> [JURIST report] by the administration a week later. Watson initially <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-denies-hawaiis-attempt-to-exempt-grandparents-from-travel-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the state's request because he did not want to "usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court." Hawaii appealed to the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], but the application was <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-weigh-in-on-hawaii-challenge-to-travel-ban-rules.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction. Although he refused to define the Supreme Court's ruling, Watson agreed to review the government's interpretation and after doing so widened the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hawaii-judge-travel-ban-07132017-story.html">definition</a> [AP report] of "close family members" to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers-and-sisters-in-law. Additionally, Watson stated that refugees with an assurance from a US resettlement agency meets the Supreme Court's requirements because it is a formal, documented contract that places obligations upon a specific individual who has been approved for entry by the Department of Homeland Security [official website]. He concluded, "Bona fide does not get any more bona fide than that." </p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the federal judiciary. In June the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. Also in June the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier that same month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington granted a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hkcfa.hk/en/home/index.html">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-idUSKBN19Z0NY">voided</a> [Reuters report] the oaths of office of four opposition lawmakers on Friday and removed them from the legislature. Among the four disqualified lawmakers were 24-year-old Nathan Law, leader of the 2014 "Umbrella movement" protests, veteran activist "Long Hair" Kwok-hung Leung, Siu-lai Lau, and Edward Yiu. The reasons behind Judge Thomas Au's decision to remove the lawmakers were varied, but all had a rather broad common theme - changing the wording of the oath of office or failing to take the oath in a "sincere and solemn" manner. Specifically, of the four removed lawmakers, Au said Law  "expressed a doubt on or disrespect of the status of the [People's Republic of China] as a legitimate sovereign of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region." Law had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40604363">quoted</a> [BBC News report] Mahatma Gandhi during his swearing in saying: "you can never imprison my mind." Au also referred to Leung's colorful display of a yellow umbrella bearing pro-democracy and protest messages as disqualifying his oath. Lau was disqualified for reading her oath at a slow pace, while Yiu was disqualified for adding words to his oath. Au concluded that <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/news/">The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China</a> (NPC) [official website] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37893070">interpreted</a> [BBC News report] the <a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/images/basiclawtext_doc25.pdf">Basic Law</a> [text, PDF] last year to require city lawmakers to swear allegiance to a China-Hong Kong, and that changing the wording of their oath or lacking sincerity is grounds for dismissal. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called the ruling an "alarming blow to Hong Kong's fast deteriorating autonomy ... used to excise some elected pro-democracy activists from legislature, to rig the system further in favor of pro-Beijing politicians." The four lawmakers have indicated their intention to appeal the decision. </p>

<p>Hong Kong was a British colony until 20 years ago when it moved under the authority of the People's Republic of China (PRC) under a "one country, two systems" setup. This setup was designed to protect Hong Kong's autonomy and allow freedoms not permitted in mainland China. However, this autonomy has often been curtailed in situations where such autonomy appeared to question PRC's dominion over Hong Kong. In November 2016 the Hong Kong Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/hong-kong-court-bans-elected-officials-from-taking-office.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against two elected, pro-independence politicians from taking local office. That caused more than 1,000 Hong Kong lawyers, dressed in black, <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/hong-kong-lawyers-march-to-oppose-china-blocking-pro-democratic-lawmakers-from-taking-legislative-se.php">to march</a> [JURIST report] through the city in opposition of the decision. In January an estimated 5,000 people <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/new-years-day-protests-take-place-in-hong-kong.php">marched in Hong Kong</a> [JURIST report] in support of pro-democracy politicians who were similarly barred from taking office the previous year for altering their oaths office. In August a Hong Kong court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/hong-kong-protest-leaders-avoid-jail-time-at-sentencing.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three leaders, who participated in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, of unlawful assembly and inciting others to join the assembly. Among these protestors was Nathan Law, one of the lawmakers disqualified in this decision on Friday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/">Office of the Inspector General</a> for the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official websites] issued a <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1705.pdf#page=1">report</a> [PDF] on Friday criticizing the <a href="https://www.bop.gov/">Bureau of Prison</a>'s (BOP) [official website] treatment of inmates with mental illnesses. The report <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/13/537076246/federal-report-criticizes-harsh-treatment-of-lewisburg-prisoners">singles out</a> [NPR report] a prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, having a pending lawsuit against it, alleging that the institution mistreated prisoners and denied adequate mental health services. According to the report, the BOP is violating its own recently implemented policy by keeping prisoners with mental illness in solitary confinement for too long and denying them medical treatment. The <a href="http://www.aca.org/aca_prod_imis/aca_member">American Correctional Association</a> [official website] recommends that solitary confinement cells be no smaller than 80 square feet, but those at Lewisburg are a mere 58.5 square feet. Prisoners who suffer from mental illness are confined with other afflicted inmates which often results in violent confrontations that cause serious injuries or death. The report also found that many who arrive at Lewisburg prison with mental disorders are denied treatment and medication. "We believe that the additional requirements established by the new policy, along with no increase in mental health staffing, resulted in institution mental health staffs reducing the number of [mentally ill] inmates, who are required to receive more frequent mental health care." According to NPR, the BOP's acting director agreed to conduct a "comprehensive review" of Lewisburg prison and adopt the recommendations provided by the report.</p>

<p>The increasing need to provide inmates with medical and legal services has been a significant issue of concern for quite some time. On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-medical-evaluation-of-mentally-ill-death-row-inmate.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that a Texas death-row inmate must be provided funds to build a defense against his impending execution. Earlier this month, William Morva was <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/virginia-executes-inmate-despite-international-pressure.php">executed by lethal injection</a> [JURIST report] after supporters failed to convince <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] to grant him clemency because of a mental illness. In June, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The raid left 44 Special Action Force (SAF) commandos dead as a result of a firefight with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, and another privately armed group. Ombudsman <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/index.php?home=1&navId=MQ==&subNavId=ODI=">Conchita Carpio Morales</a> [official profile] ordered that Aquino be charged with usurpation of authority under the <a href="/paperchase/Philippines%20Revised%20Penal%20Code.pdf">Revised Penal Code</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="/paperchase/Philippines%20Anti-Graft%20and%20Corrupt%20Practices%20Act.pdf">Philippines Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</a> [text, PDF]. According to the order, the charges are based on: 1) participation and assistance in planning the operation with gross and inexcusable negligence; 2) approval of the operation with full knowledge that it was flawed; 3) allowing suspended [Philippine National Police] Chief Alan Purisima to participate in the planning and running of said operation and proving information and intelligence, and (4) breach of established norms inherent in a chain of command. Of Purisima's involvement specifically, Morales stated: </p>

<blockquote>there is no gainsaying that President Aquino was fully aware that the Office of the Ombudsman had placed Purisima under preventive suspension at that time [for the anomalous Werfest deal].&#8221; Despite this, SMS exchanges between President Aquino and Purisima showed that the suspended police chief played a major role in the botched operation .... certainly a public officer who is under preventive suspension in barred from performing any public functions and from meddling into the affairs of the government.</blockquote>

<p>Others charged in this order include Purisima himself and SAF Director Getulio Napeñas. According to Aquino, he did not directly participate in the planning and execution of the operation. Aquino's spokeswoman Abigail Valte said that Aquino is currently in the process of seeking advice from his attorneys. </p>

<p>Philippines has been on the international spotlight ever since Rodrigo Duterte took office as the president of the nation. In June, Philippine opposition lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/philippine-lawmakers-petition-supreme-court-to-end-president-dutertes-martial-law.php">petitioned</a> the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reject <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36659258">President Rodrigo Duterte's </a> [BBC profile] imposition of martial law. Duterte <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/philippines-president-declares-martial-law-as-militants-invade-marawi-city.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on the island of Mindanao in May when heavily armed militants linked to the Islamic State [BBC profile] took over large parts of Marawi City, a provincial capital in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. In April, a lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/lawyer-files-icc-complaint-against-phillipines-president-over-alleged-death-squad.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Duterte accusing him of extrajudicial killings during his nationwide anti-drugs crackdown. In March, the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report accusing the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">called for a murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] for a murder investigation of Duterte after he admitted to killing people while he served as mayor of Davao.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Venezuela government's opposition opened polls Sunday over <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/26/world/americas/nicolas-maduro-fast-facts/index.html">President Nicolas Maduro's</a> [CNN profile] call to <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/venezuela-president-pledges-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">rewrite the constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Many have accused Maduro's plan to be undemocratic and a way to suppress the months of anti-government protests against his presidency. Maduro <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article161211773.html">states</a> [Miami Herald report] that the new assembly which would elect 527 members as it is the only solution to bring an end to the anti-government protests that have brought significant violence to the country. The opposition's vote is being held at over 2,000 polling stations and is also available to those abroad, with as many as 11 million of the 30 million population turning out to vote. The government has urged its supporters to boycott the vote as electoral officials have not approved it.</p>

<p>Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the December 2015 election. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions </a>[JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to open <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://sfsuperiorcourt.org/">Superior Court of California</a> [official website] postponed a decision Friday for injunctive relief to block <a href="https://www.toshiba.co.jp/worldwide/index.html">Toshiba Corporation</a> [official website] from selling its flash memory business in an attempt to relieve losses from the nuclear reactor business. As per a joint venture with Western Digital which helps finance equipment at Toshiba's plants, Western Digital has also invoked separate arbitration proceedings. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harold-kahn/">Judge Kahn</a> [Washington Times profile] delayed the ruling on the injunction and instead proposed that Toshiba be required to give Western Digital two weeks notice that the sale would be closing if the arbitration was still proceeding. A subsequent hearing has been scheduled for July 28. </p>

<p>Toshiba has been under fire in recent years for questionable practices. Toshiba's nuclear reactor stations failing had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale">caused significant loss</a> [Guardian report] for the company earlier this year. A third-party investigative report released on July 20, 2015, found that Toshiba Corporation had <a href="/forum/2015/08/bruce-aronson-toshiba-scandal.php">  padded its profits</a> [JURIST op-ed] by $1.2 billion (1.5 billion yen) over the past six years. The company is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cfd3c68-d23a-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0?mhq5j=e1">still facing issues</a> [Financial Times report] from that 2015 scandal that has investors worried about the company.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [advocacy website] <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_midyear_report_2017_july_2017.pdf">released a report</a> [text, PDF] Monday condemning an increase in civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017. Although there was an overall decrease in civilian casualties in the first six months of 2017, there was an increase in injuries and deaths from improvised explosive devices (IED). IEDs from anti-government forces, the majority of which are suicide bombs, account for 40 percent of all civilian casualties in the beginning of 2017. The report notes that the increase in aerial operations and the use of pressure-place devices in civilian-populated areas led to an increase in women and child casualties as well. Additionally, the report enumerates they ways ground engagements extend human suffering beyond death and injury such as the displacement of communities, families and individuals; property damage; loss of livelihood; and diminished access to education, medical care and humanitarian aid. The UNAMA praised pro-government forces for a decrease in casualties from national security efforts and encouraged a further reduction throughout the remainder of 2017. The report concludes with recommendations to the Government of Afghanistan, anti-government groups and international military forces offering aid to "support their efforts to protect civilians, prevent civilian casualties and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law."</p>

<p>Civilian casualties continue to be a primary issue in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. In February at least 20 people were reported to have been killed and 41 injured following a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/afghanistan-supreme-court-attack-kills-20.php">terrorist attack</a> [JURIST report] at the Supreme Court in Kabul, Afghanistan. In February of last year UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high 11,000 in 2015. Last June, three Taliban gunmen <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/taliban-gunmen-attack-afghanistan-court-building-killing-prosecutor.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor. In November 2015 the US Department of Defense and Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/pentagon-determines-human-error-caused-afghanistan-hospital-bombing.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing of the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, and <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/631359/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-campbell-via-teleconference-fro/">announced</a> [statement] that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Venezuelans voted on Sunday to reject President Nicolás Maduro's plan to rewrite the nation's constitution. The non-binding referendum was <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537657163/in-unofficial-vote-venezuelans-overwhelmingly-reject-constitutional-rewrite">organized</a> [NPR report] by the country's opposition activists. More than 7 million individuals, roughly one-third of Venezuela's registered voters, took part with over 98 percent rejecting Maduro's <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/venezuela-president-pledges-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">plan</a> [JURIST report]. Many have accused the efforts for a constitutional rewrite to be undemocratic and a way to suppress the months of anti-government protests against Maduro's presidency. Maduro <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article161211773.html">states</a> [Miami Herald report] that the new assembly, which would elect 527 members, is the only solution to bring an end to the anti-government protests that have brought significant violence to the country. Many government supporters peacefully boycotted Sunday's vote but several men on motorbikes, described by the opposition as "members of a parliamentary," opened fire on a polling station in Caracas, injuring three and killing a 61-year-old nurse. The government has refused to recognize the vote as legal and will go forward with plans to hold an election on July 30 to select delegates for a special assembly that will be responsible for rewriting the 18-year-old constitution. </p>

<p>Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">open criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people rallied in Warsaw, Poland on Sunday to protest controversial proposals aimed at reforming the country's court system. The demonstration comes as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-protests-idUSKBN1A10S3">response</a> [Reuters report] to a series of bills passed by Poland's <a href="https://www.senat.gov.pl/en/">Senate</a> [official website] over the last week that many fear are a threat to judicial independence. The bills give parliament, where the <a href="http://pis.org.pl/">Law and Justice</a> (PiS) party [party website, in Polish] holds the majority, a greater role in selecting judges. One of the proposed bills will grant the justice minister the power to replace any Supreme Court justices and chief justices of the common courts without the approval of judicial circles. Opposition leaders, including Ryszard Petru of the Modern party and Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.msz.gov.pl/en/ministry/minister/minister_of_foreign_affairs_grzegorz_schetyna?printMode=true">Grzegorz Schetyna</a> [official website] of Civic Platform, have agreed to work together to keep the constitutionally-mandated separation of powers in place. They urged protestors to continue demonstrating in front of parliament until Tuesday when a debate concerning the Supreme Court bill will take place. The <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union</a> [official website] has threatened to take Poland to court for undermining the democratic system of checks and balances. In order to become law, President <a href="http://www.president.pl/en/">Andrzej Duda</a> [official website] will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40622896">need to sign</a> [BBC report] the bills. He has given no indication that he will veto the proposed legislation. </p>

<p>PiS has drawn ire from those in the international community for threatening democracy in Poland. In August 2016 Polish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/poland-to-investigate-head-of-constitutional-tribunal.php">began an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. In June of last year the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] issued a warning to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The European Union began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. That February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that grants the <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. In December 2015 the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/">Russian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on Monday upheld its ruling ordering the disbanding of the Jehovah's Witnesses. In denying an appeal by the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Supreme Court <a href="http://tass.com/society/956654">affirmed</a> [TASS report] that their previous ruling will remain in place and unchanged. The prior ruling was considered the Jehovah's Witnesses to be an extremist organization because it distributed pamphlets that promoted hatred of other denominations, such as the Russian Orthodox Church. The order for disbanding took place immediately and calls for all 395 branches of the religion to shut down and the forfeiture of their properties to the government. After having their appeal denied, the Jehovah's Witnesses plan to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home"> European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Russia's human rights and religious freedom record has been the subject of widespread international criticism. On April 20 the Russian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-top-court-bans-jehovahs-witnesses.php">issued its initial ruling</a> [JURIST report] ordering the disbanding of the Jehovah's Witnesses. In February the Russian Supreme Court annulled the 2.5 year prison sentence of Ildar Dadin, who was the first person to be convicted under a relatively <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-highest-court-releases-political-activist.php">new anti-protest law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in February the European Court of Human Rights ordered Russia to pay more than 63,000 euros for <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">arresting Alexander Navalny multiple times</a> [JURIST report] between March 2012 and February 2014. The court held that Russia repeatedly and unjustifiably violated Navalny's right to freedom of peaceful assembly under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-sanctions-five-russian-officials-for-human-rights-abuses.php">sanctioned</a> [JURIST report] five Russian officials for human rights abuses in association with the death of a lawyer in prison. The Russian Foreign Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/russia-announces-intentions-to-leave-icc.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that Russia would leave the International Criminal Court (ICC), expressing disdain over the ICC's investigation into potential human rights abuses by Russian forces in South Ossetia in 2008. In May 2015 Russian President Vladmir Putin signed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/russia-president-signs-restrictive-law-against-undesirable-ngos.php">law</a> [JURIST report] that allows for foreign "undesirable" NGOs or firms to be sanctioned and banned from operating in the country, drawing criticism from human rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opposition parties petitioned the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Pakistan Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday to remove Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office after the joint investigation team's (JIT) <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=2506">report</a> [text] stipulated that there was sufficient proof that the prime minister and his family held wealth beyond their known means of income. The JIT was created in April when the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-supreme-court-rejects-calls-for-removing-prime-minister.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] disqualifying Sharif from office stating the evidence was insufficient. A special bench consisting of three justices will review the proceedings and issue summons to any further testimony or evidence needed to conclude the months-long turmoil. The court will resume hearings on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Pakistan's current government has been under scrutiny in the last few months by its own people and around the world. In April a Pakistan military court sentenced <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav-the-hindu-explains/article17907888.ece">Kulbushan Jadhav</a> [The Hindu backgrounder], an Indian naval officer who was detained in Pakistan for the past year, to death. The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php">handed down</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence after finding Jadhav guilty of espionage and sabotage. However in May the International Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/icj-calls-for-pakistan-to-delay-execution-of-accused-india-spy.php">instructed Pakistan</a> [JURIST report] to withhold the execution until the international court reaches its final decision. In March the Pakistan National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/pakistan-assembly-votes-to-continue-use-of-military-courts-on-terrorism-suspects.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to renew an amendment to the country's constitution that allows military tribunals to oversee civilians accused of terrorist-related crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusett </a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/sjc/reporter-of-decisions/new-opinions/12226.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that a woman who was fired from her job for testing positive for medically prescribed marijuana could sue her former employer for handicap discrimination. The employee in this case was prescribed medical marijuana to combat the low appetite that she experienced due to Crohn's Disease. The court's decision overturned a prior dismissal of the employee's claim for handicap discrimination and will allow her to proceed with the lawsuit. The court noted that a handicap discrimination claim can be alleged where an employee could perform the essential functions of their job with some form of accommodation so long as the accommodation is facially reasonable. In rejecting the employer's argument that using medical marijuana is unreasonable because it is illegal under federal law, the Court held that this fact does not make the use of medical marijuana per se unreasonable as an accommodation where a doctor deems it to be the most effective treatment for a patient's condition. </p>

<p>The legalization of both medical and recreational marijuana has become a popular issue over the past few years. In June three Kentuckians <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/kentuckys-criminal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-challenged-with-lawsuit.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] the state's criminal ban on medical marijuana. Earlier in June US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/?utm_term=.0f30b0b4aff3">asked Congress</a> [WP report] to undo the federal protections on medical marijuana. In June the California State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-vote-to-prohibit-state-authorities-from-assisting-federal-law-enforcement-agenc.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] with the bare minimum 41 out of 80 votes that, if passed by the Senate, will prohibit state and local authorities from assisting federal agencies in the enforcement of marijuana laws without a court order. Before Sessions's confirmation, Hilary Bricken of the <a href="http://cannalawgroup.com/">Canna Law Group</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/11/Hilary-Bricken-Fear-and-Loathing.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] about how the Trump administration could impact the status of cannabis at the state level. Elsewhere in North America, marijuana legalization has become a priority. The Mexico Chamber of Deputies <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/mexico-legislature-approves-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in April allowing the use, production and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. Also in April Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-legalizing-medicinal-marijuana-extract.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] Senate Bill 10, legalizing the medicinal use of a marijuana extract, into law. In March a government official from Canada <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/canada-may-legalize-recreational-marijuana-by-july-2018.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the country's intention to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court <a href="http://www.almcms.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/292/2017/07/nsl-opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that a nondisclosure requirement in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709">National Security Letters</a> (NSL) [text] law does not conflict with the First Amendment. Therefore the court also concluded that private companies that are issued an NSL by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] must also follow the nondisclosure requirement if the letter contains it in that case. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] heard the case with Judge Sandra Ikuta delivering the unanimous opinion. The court held that the nondisclosure requirement is a content-based restriction therefore subject to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], but it also survives that scrutiny. "We therefore conclude that the 2015 NSL law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, both as to<br />
inclusiveness and duration. Accordingly, we hold that the nondisclosure requirement in § 2709(c) survives strict scrutiny." There has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-idUSKBN1A21XJ">no decision</a> [Reuters report] by the plaintiff parties in this case on if they plan to appeal to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p><br />
The use of communication surveillance continues to be a hot topic in security rights in the US. In May the National Security Agency (NSA) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/nsa-collected-citizens-phone-records-despite-usa-freedom-act.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] stating the agency had collected and stored more than 1.5 million civilian phone records in 2016. In March the New York Police Department reached a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/settlement-approved-in-nypd-muslim-surveillance-case.php">settlement over its surveillance of Muslims</a> [JURIST report]. The new settlement would create greater oversight of the NYPD's intelligence-gathering programs by a civilian representative. In the original rejection of the case, the judge stated that the agreement did not ensure that the NYPD would be limited in how it could monitor political and religious activity. In January a judge for the US District Court for the District of Utah refused to dismiss <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rules-nsa-olympic-surveillance-lawsuit-may-continue.php">a complaint against the NSA</a> [JURIST report] over allegations of warrantless surveillance during the 2002 winter Olympic games. The case includes individuals who allege their communication devices were searched and seized by the NSA during the games. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Turkish court on Tuesday ordered that six human rights activists, including <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a>'s (AI) [advocacy website] Turkey Director, remain in custody pending trial for allegedly aiding an armed terrorist group. The activists were <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/jailing-of-activists-including-amnesty-director-a-crushing-blow-for-rights-in-turkey/">arrested</a> [AI press release] on July 5 during a training workshop and are "suspected of 'committing crime in the name of a terrorist organization without being a member.'" According to AI: <blockquote>The bizarre accusations include attempts to link Idil Eser with three unrelated and opposing terrorist organizations through her work for Amnesty International. The prosecutor's request that she be remanded in pre-trial prison custody references two campaigns by Amnesty International, neither of which were authored by Amnesty Turkey, one of which was conducted before she joined the organization.</blockquote> Turkish media sources <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-07-18/turkey-6-human-rights-activists-jailed-pending-trial">reported</a> [AP report] that prosecutors presented evidence that linked the advocacy group's communication with US-based <a href="https://www.fgulen.com/en/">Fethullah Gulen</a> [official website], who is accused of orchestrating a failed coup attempt last year. Earlier this month, Turkish President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a> [BBC profile] accused the group of being involved in a meeting concerning a continuation of the coup. AI has called for Turkey to release the activists, saying, "This is not a legitimate investigation, this is a politically motivated witch-hunt that charts a frightening future for rights in Turkey." Four of the human rights defenders were released on bail with <a href="http://time.com/4862281/turkey-amnesty-international-rights-activists-jailed/">orders</a> [TIME report] to remain in the country and regularly check in with local authorities. </p>

<p>The aftermath of the failed coup attempt continues as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] that those involved in the coup would "pay a heavy price." In May, a trial over the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/turkey-200-defendants-put-on-trial-over-2016-coup-attempt.php">began</a> [JURIST report] at a prison courtroom in Sincan. Earlier that week, Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/erdogan-extends-state-of-emergency-in-turkey.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the state of emergency temporarily placed on the country after the failed coup would continue until the country reached "welfare and peace." In November, Turkey significantly halted the activities of 370 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including human rights and children's groups to investigate the groups' <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkey-significantly-restricts-activities-of-ngos-and-rights-organizations.php">alleged terror connections</a> [JURIST report]. The president of the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, Theodor Meron, <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-demands-turkey-release-international-judge.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] the release of Turkish judge Aydin Sefa Akay in an address to the UN General Assembly. Earlier that month, the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] eight pro-Kurdish political party members, including the party's two leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag and an additional nine party members. In September, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said that approximately 32,000 people have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/turkish-official-more-than-32000-arrested-in-connection-with-coup-attempt.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] and 70,000 have been questioned. In late October, Turkey's government <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/turkey-government-dismisses-10000-civil-servants-and-closes-15-media-outlets.php">dismissed 10,000 additional civil servants</a> [JURIST report] and closed 15 more media outlets for their supposed connection with US-based religious leader Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating the attempted coup in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippines <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36659258">President Rodrigo Duterte</a> [BBC profile] asked Congress on Tuesday to extend his order of martial law for the lower third of the country. Duterte <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/philippines-president-declares-martial-law-as-militants-invade-marawi-city.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on the island of Mindanao in May when heavily armed militants linked to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> [BBC profile] took over large parts of Marawi City, a provincial capital in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. More than 500 people have been killed in the fighting that has taken place since the take-over. The 60-day proclamation is due to expire on July 22 but Duterte contends that the rebellion that justified the declaration will not be quelled by then. Duterte requested that Congress, which is scheduled to reconvene for its regular session July 24, hold a special session to discuss the proposed extension. Opposition lawmakers question Duterte's motivation behind the extension and feel that the move is unjustified calling it a "whimsical proposal that has no substantive grounds."</p>

<p>Philippines has been on the international spotlight ever since Rodrigo Duterte took office as the president of the nation. Earlier this week, the Philippines <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/">Office of the Ombudsman</a> [official website] announced <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/former-philippine-president-to-be-charged-with-usurpation-because-of-botched-raid.php">plans to charge</a> [JURIST report] former Philippines president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benigno-Aquino-III">Benigno Aquino III</a> [Britannica profile] for the botched "anti-terror" raid that led to what is known as the Mamasapano massacre in 2015. In June, Philippine opposition lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/philippine-lawmakers-petition-supreme-court-to-end-president-dutertes-martial-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reject President Rodrigo Duterte's imposition of martial law. In April, a lawyer filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/lawyer-files-icc-complaint-against-phillipines-president-over-alleged-death-squad.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Duterte accusing him of extrajudicial killings during his nationwide anti-drugs crackdown. In March, the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report accusing the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] for a murder investigation of Duterte after he admitted to killing people while he served as mayor of Davao.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California Governor <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] has been <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19877">credited</a> [press release] with pushing through legislation Monday to extend the state's cap and trade program another 10 years. Bills <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB398">AB 398</a> and <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB617">AB 617</a> [materials] were passed by the California legislature with the support of more than 150 community leaders and groups, including those of environmental and public health. The program is aimed at reducing green house gas levels to 40% below the 1990 level statewide. The program is also crafted to keep up with changing technology resources while staying economically feasible. </p>

<p>According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. In June President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-us-to-pull-out-of-the-paris-climate-deal.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that the US will no longer be part of the Paris climate accord.

In October the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/paris-agreement-on-climate-change-achieves-threshold-for-entry-into-force.php">achieved </a>[JURIST report]. The threshold of 55 parties making up more than 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions triggered the entry into force of the agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Al Hussein</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21887&LangID=E">expressed concerns</a> [UN report] that the Libyan National Army (LNA) has committed and will continue to commit summary executions of men that have been taken prisoner. Through a spokesperson, Hussein stated that the alarm over the worsening human rights conditions in the nation was heightened after recent fighting in Benghazi. Reports of torture and videos of summary executions by LNA officials have surfaced beginning as early as March. A video posted this month showed prisoners being physically and verbally assaulted by officers while being accused of terrorism. The Commissioner also noted that unlawful killings have occurred on both fronts of the conflict in Libya, called for an end to the impunity offered on both sides, and urged the LNA to conduct a full and impartial investigation into alleged war crimes. </p>

<p>Libya has remained politically unstable since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">deposition of Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war. In April Sicilian prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro stated to reporters that an <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/sicily-prosecutor-ngos-cooperating-with-libya-smugglers.php">investigation</a>[JURIST report] has revealed evidence of direct contacts between some non-governmental organizations and human traffickers in Libya. In September the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore, spoke on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-continuing-to-deteriorate.php">deteriorating human rights situation</a> [JURIST report] in Libya and called for accountability and reform. Earlier last year the UN released a report detailing a "litany of violations and abuses" being committed by both state and non-state actors in Libya that may amount to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-report-libya-abuses-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://lyldenlawnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hawaii-order-7-19.pdf">affirmed in part</a> [order, PDF] a ruling by the <a href="http://www.hid.uscourts.gov/index.cfm?pid=0&mid=1">US District Court for the District of Hawaii</a> [official website] concerning the scope of the Trump administration's travel ban. The state of Hawaii filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16-1540-Trump-v.-Hawaii-response-to-motion-for-clarification.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] on Tuesday in response to the government's request that the US Supreme Court clarify who can enter the US while the order is in place. Earlier this month, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-expands-travel-ban-exemptions.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the exemptions permitted under the temporary travel bar on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. Although he refused to define the Supreme Court's ruling, Judge Derrick Watson agreed to review the government's interpretation and after doing so widened the definition of "close family members" to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers-and-sisters-in-law. Additionally, Watson stated that refugees with an assurance from a US resettlement agency meet the Supreme Court's requirements because it is a formal, documented contract that places obligations upon a specific individual who has been approved for entry by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website]. The government responded by petitioning the Supreme Court for emergency relief and sought to obtain an expansion of the stay the Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that the District Court's modification "eviscerated" the ruling. Hawaii stated that the government's claim is "nonsense" and that <blockquote>the District Court faithfully applied this Court&#8217;s opinion, holding that &#8220;close relatives&#8221; like grandparents and nieces are permitted to enter, and recognizing that the charities, non-profits, and churches that have made a formal, contractual commitment to shelter and clothe refugees would suffer &#8220;concrete hardship&#8221; if those refugees are excluded.</blockquote> The government <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/07/hawaii-urges-justices-deny-motion-clarification-travel-ban/">responded</a> [SCOTUSBlog post] with the assertion that the Supreme Court is the only court that can properly interpret its own order. The Supreme Court <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/supreme-court-travel-ban-grandparents/index.html">lifted</a> [CNN report] the exemption judge Watson ordered for refugees but allowed the application to exclude grandparents and other relatives from the ban. The Court also directed that further review of the issue should be directed to the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the federal judiciary. In June the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. Also in June the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, to determine whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier that same month the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington granted a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced on Wednesday that it is reviving a provision of the federal civil asset forfeiture program, which was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-suspends-asset-forfeiture-program.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in September 2015. The DOJ is reviving a portion of this program in response to President Donald Trump's order to reduce crime because asset forfeiture diminishes organized crime. Attorney General Jeff Sessions outlined the changes to the program that will help better protect law-abiding citizens. Any state or local law enforcement agency must provide sufficient evidence of criminal activity before asset seizure is permitted. One safeguard to ensure the evidence standard is met is the "Request for Adoption of State and Local Seizure" form, which requires the law enforcement agency to provide additional evidence supporting probable cause before seizure is permitted. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/982616/download">policy directive</a> [text] notes that additional safeguards may also be placed on the adoption of cash amounts equal to or less than $10,000, stating:<blockquote>Those adoptions will be permissible where the seizure was conducted: (1) pursuant to a state warrant, (2) incident to arrest for an offense relevant to the forfeiture, (3) at the same time as a seizure of contraband relevant to the forfeiture, or (4) where the owner or person from whom the property is seized makes admissions regarding the criminally derived nature of the property.</blockquote>The forfeiture program was highly controversial when it was discontinued in 2015, but has since been altered to better protect innocent citizens. The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-142_7l48.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in June in <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-limits-forfeiture-in-drug-crimes.php">Honeycutt v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that forfeiture is limited to property the defendant actually obtained as a result of the crime or "tainted property." The court held that the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/948">Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984</a> [text] limits property to the definitions within the act and rejected the government's argument that the standard should be the background principle of conspiracy liability that the conspirators be responsible for each other's foreseeable actions within the common plan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ICC orders Gbagbo&#039;s continued detention pending trial chamber&#039;s review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2017_04684.PDF">reversed</a> [holding, PDF] the Trial Chamber's "Decision on Laurent Gbagbo Detention," thereby ordering continued detention until the Trial Chamber carries out a new review of his release. As the former Ivory Coast president, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12933023">Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST news archive] has been detained since 2011 and currently faces charges for crimes against humanity. Gbagbo appealed the Trial Chamber's decision to deny his request for release. The Appeals Chamber said the lower court failed to consider several factors before refusing to release Gbagbo:<blockquote>The Trial Chamber erroneously considered that Mr Gbagbo's age militated in favour of maintaining his detention. Furthermore, despite the presumption of innocence and Mr Gbagbo's right not to be compelled to testify or to confess guilt, the Trial Chamber erroneously relied on the fact that he has denied responsibility for the crimes with which he is charged. It also failed to consider the duration of Mr Gbagbo's detention and his state of health.</blockquote>The court's decision emphasized that it is not suggesting the Trial Chamber make a certain determination upon review, only that the Trial Chamber consider all factors before rendering a decision. </p>

<p>Gbagbo's detention and <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/end-of-mutiny-on-ivory-coast.php">turmoil</a> [JURIST report] facing the Ivory Coast, stems from Gbagbo's acts following defeat in his second presidential race to former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] . The EU recognized that Ouattara defeated Gbagbo, but Gbagbo refused to concede victory [JURIST report]. Gbagbo has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-ivory-coast-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-war-crimes.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of starting a civil war after losing the presidency, which resulted in 3,000 deaths and the displacement of one million people. Voters in the Ivory Coast successfully <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/ivory-coast-president-signs-new-constitution.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution last year. In November, Oattara signed the constitution into law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>  (DOJ) together with the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official websites] have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alphabay-largest-online-dark-market-shut-down">seized and shut down</a> [DOJ press release] AlphaBay, a criminal marketplace on the "dark web" on Thursday. The site, which has reportedly been operating on the dark web for the last two years, was used to sell numerous illicit products including illegal narcotics, computer hacking tools, malware, firearms, fraudulent identification documents, counterfeit products, and toxic chemicals. A majority of the business done on the site involved illicit narcotics, predominantly heroin and fentanyl. AlphaBay was shut down after an operation involving law enforcement agencies from seven separate nations and <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/">Europol</a>  [official website] managed to seize the site's infrastructure. In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-press-conference-announcing-alphabay">statement</a> [text] to the press, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>  [official profile] called the event "the largest dark net marketplace takedown in history."Another dark marketplace called the Hansa Market was also taken down by the same agencies on Thursday. </p>

<p>Cybercrime continues to be a serious issue around the world. In 2015 the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-doj-indicts-turkish-man-for-cyber-crimes-valued-at-55-million.php">unsealed the indictment </a> [JURIST report] of a Turkish man for allegedly organizing three cyber-attacks that led to an estimated $55 million in global losses. Also in 2015 a former US government employee with the Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/former-government-employee-charged-with-cybercrime-associated-with-the-department-of-energy.php">charged</a>  [JURIST report] with a four count violation of federal law in connection with an attempted phishing scheme involving Department of Energy employee emails. In October 2014 a court in Denmark <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/pirate-bay-co-founder-convicted-of-hacking-stealing-denmark-records.php">convicted</a>  [JURIST report] Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, the co-founder of the file-sharing website The Pirate Bay (TPB), and an accomplice for stealing Danish public records from the US-based information technology business CSC. From April to August of 2012, Svartholm Warg and his accomplice were alleged to have hacked into the mainframe systems of CSC, which manages some of Denmark's public records. More than 200,000 records were stolen, including social security numbers and the e-mail addresses and passwords of policemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/">Polish Parliament</a> [official website] approved a bill on Thursday that will implement sweeping reforms to the country's judicial system. Most notably, the bill will allow members of parliament to appoint Supreme Court judges, a move that the EU, many Polish lawyers, and citizens of Poland strongly opposed. The ruling <a href="http://pis.org.pl/">Law and Justice</a> (PiS) party [party website, in Polish] pushed the bill through just days after <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/thousands-rally-in-poland-to-protest-judicial-reforms.php">thousands of people</a> [JURIST report] rallied in Warsaw to protest what has been seen as a massive power-grab by the party. <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/">Donald Tusk</a> [official website], President of the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/home/">European Council</a> [official website] and a former Prime Minister of Poland released a <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/07/20-tusk-statement-situation-poland/">statement</a>  [text] voicing concern over the bill:<blockquote>Bringing the courts under the control of the governing party in the manner proposed by the Law and Justice Party (PiS) will ruin the already tarnished public opinion about Polish democracy. We must therefore find a solution which will be accepted by the Poles, the parliamentary majority and the opposition, the President and the European Union. I know this is hard. It will require concessions, mutual respect and a little bit of trust. Hard, yet not impossible. But there is very little time left.</blockquote>The bill now goes before <a href="http://www.president.pl/en/">President Andrzej Duda</a>  [official website] who will need to sign before it goes into law. Thus far, Duda has not indicated any reluctance to sign the bill. </p>

<p>PiS has drawn ire from those in the international community for threatening democracy in Poland. In August 2016 Polish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/poland-to-investigate-head-of-constitutional-tribunal.php">began an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. In June of last year the European Commission issued a warning to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. That February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that grants the <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. In December 2015 the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.or.th/webportal/supremecourt/index.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website] sentenced opposition leader Jatuporn Prompan to one year in prison for defaming Thailand's current prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13298394">Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [BBC Profile]. Jatuporn, a leader of the "red shirt" opposition party, which supports two of Thailand's formerly ousted prime ministers, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-politics-idUSKBN1A50R3">convicted</a> [Reuters report] for calling Abhisit a "murderer" during a rally. Abhisit <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1290658/supreme-court-jails-jatuporn-for-defaming-abhisit">said</a> [Bangkok Times report] that Jatuporn's statement damaged his reputation.  The Supreme Court, overruling two lower court decisions, said that Jatuporn was guilty because his statement had not been fact-checked.  </p>

<p>Thailand's enforcement of laws stifling free speech has become increasingly prevalent within this year alone. In May Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thailand-orders-facebook-to-remove-posts-about-king.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Facebook to remove posts about the king. That same month a Thai human rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thailand-human-rights-lawyer-charged-for-insulting-royal-family.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] for insulting the royal family.  In February the Supreme Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/thailand-court-upholds-magazine-editors-royal-insult-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the sentence of a former magazine editor who published stories criticizing the royal family. Earlier in February human rights groups urged the Thai Army to drop <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-groups-urge-thailand-officials-to-drop-charges-against-3-activists.php">defamation charges</a> [JURIST report] against three activists. Prior to that, UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-not-to-stifle-free-speech.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Thai authorities Tuesday to cease using royal defamation laws to counter free speech that is critical of the royal family.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/cameroon-amnesty-report-reveals-war-crimes-in-fight-against-boko-haram-including-horrific-use-of-torture/">accused</a> [AI report] Cameroon of torturing suspected supporters of Boko Haram in a report released Thursday. According to the human rights organization, hundreds of suspects were "subjected to severe beatings, agonizing stress positions and drownings, with some tortured to death" at the hands of government authorities. AI documented 101 cases of secret detention and torture within the last four years. Alioune Tine, Amnesty International's Regional Director for West and Central Africa, said "[t]hese horrific violations amount to war crimes." AI also observed American and French military personnel at one of the bases while the detention and torture was taking place. The organization is calling for the US and France to investigate the extent of knowledge that their military personnel may have of the war crimes.  </p>

<p>Cameroon faces many problems resulting from their military conflict with the terrorist group Boko Haram. Last July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-cameroon-authorities-violating-basic-human-rights-in-boko-haram-crackdown.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] on numerous human rights violations by Cameroon authorities as the country fights the insurgency of the Islamic extremist group. Cameroon's harsh practices have come in response to atrocities committed by Boko Haram which, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">report</a>[JURIST report] last September by AI, is accountable for the death of at least 400 civilians in Northern Cameroon. The militant Islamic group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abortion rights groups filed a <a href="https://static.texastribune.org/media/documents/Center_for_Reproductive_Rights-Planned_Parenthood_Senate_Bill_8_Lawsuit_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday that seeks an injunction against against a Texas law that bans a common method of second-trimester abortions. The complaint was filed in response to <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB8">Senate Bill 8</a> [materials], which was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed in law</a> [JURIST report] in June by Texas <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website]. The bill bans second trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures, a safe and widely used method that can be performed in an outpatient setting. <a href="http://wholewomanshealth.com/">Whole Woman's Health</a>, and other women's health advocacy groups such as <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy websites], allege that:<blockquote>Enforcement of the D&E ban would irreparably harm women seeking second-trimester abortions by denying them access to the safest and most common method of abortion after approximately 15 weeks of pregnancy. Even if limited access remains available, the ban forces women seeking second-trimester abortions to undergo more complex and risky procedures, including compelling them to undergo painful, untested, and invasive medical procedures, in order to access their constitutional right to abortion.</blockquote>SB 8 is scheduled to go into effect September 1.</p>

<p>Unencumbered access to abortion has been a recent issue since President Donald Trump vowed to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will overturn <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-san-francisco-law-on-deceptive-advertising-from-anti-abortion-clinics-.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an anti-abortion health clinic's argument that a San Francisco ordinance violated their First Amendment right to free speech. Also in June in the state of Ohio lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-senate-votes-to-ban-common-method-for-second-trimester-abortions.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 24-9 in favor of a bill that would criminalize a common second trimester abortion procedure. Earlier that month the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">barred doctors</a> [JURIST report] from suing state over abortion law, holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood. In February the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. In February the Pennsylvania Senate approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal court orders Kentucky to pay attorneys&#039; fees in same-sex marriage litigation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.kyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/paperchase/Kentucky%20Attorneys%20fees%20-%20federal%20order%20on%20Kim%20Davis.pdf">order</a> [PDF] Friday holding the state of Kentucky responsible for attorneys' fees related to litigation involving a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Two years after <a href="http://rowancountyclerk.com/">Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis</a> [official website] defied the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruling in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/"><u>Obergefell v. Hodges</u></a> [SCOTUSblog materials] by refusing to issue the licenses, citing her religious beliefs, Judge David Bunning stated in his order that "the Commonwealth of Kentucky is ordered to pay Plaintiffs $222,695 in attorneys' fees." The eight attorneys who represented the plaintiffs in the matter of <a href="/paperchase/Miller%20v%20Davis%20District%20Court%20Order.pdf"><u>Miller v. Davis</u></a> [Order, PDF] were awarded fees ranging from $200 to $700 per hour. William Sharp, a legal director for the <a href="http://www.aclu-ky.org/">ACLU of Kentucky</a> [advocacy website], stating that the organization will continue to challenge "willful violations of individuals' civil liberties," added: "It is unfortunate that Kentucky taxpayers will likely bear the financial burden of the unlawful actions and litigation strategies of an elected official, but those same voters are free to take that information into account at the ballot box."</p>

<p>Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex or heterosexual couples arguing that her Christian faith should exempt her from issuing the licenses to same-sex couples. In August 2015, he US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/appeals-court-orders-kentucky-clerk-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Davis to issue the licenses, but she <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/supreme-court-denies-kentucky-clerks-bid-not-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">continued to refuse</a> [JURIST report]. The following week, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/kentucky-official-held-in-contempt-for-refusing-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] her bid to continue refusing to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples pending an appeal. In September 2015, a federal judge held Davis in <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/kentucky-official-held-in-contempt-for-refusing-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">contempt of court</a> [JURIST report] for her continued refusal, releasing her after several days in jail. Davis claimed upon returning to work later the same month that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/kentucky-county-clerk-will-not-block-clerks-from-issuing-same-sex-licenses.php">she would not block her clerks</a> [JURIST report] from issuing the licenses. Approximately two months later, Kentucky <a href="https://governor.ky.gov/">Governor Matt Bevin</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/kentucky-governor-issues-order-removing-clerks-names-from-marriage-licenses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to no longer require county clerks' names to appear on marriage licenses. The order cited the <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/17RS/HB105/bill.pdf">Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text, PDF], concluding that placing one's name on same-sex marriage licenses could substantially burden one's freedom of religion. Bevin also included in the order a new official certificate of marriage form eliminating the area for the name of the county clerk. In February 2016, the <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Senate.htm">Kentucky Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/kentucky-lawmakers-approve-separate-marriage-licenses-for-same-sex-couples.php">approved Senate Bill 5</a> [JURIST report], a legislation that would create distinct marriage license forms for opposite-sex and same-sex couples. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">António Guterres</a> [official website] issued a <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2017-07-21/statement-attributable-spokesperson-secretary-general-violence-0">statement</a> [text] through his spokesman on Friday condemning the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/21/palestinian-killed-israel-restricts-access-to-jerusalem-old-city-protest-security-measure">escalating violence</a> [<em>TheGuardian</em> report] between Israelis and Palestinians in the Old City of Jerusalem. Ongoing clashes between the two groups have left <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/news/2017/07/palestinians-killed-protests-rage-al-aqsa-170721185817303.html">three Palestinian men dead</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] in East Jerusalem, while three Israelis were stabbed to death in a West Bank settlement overnight. In addition to the six deaths, over 140 have been reported injured. Guterres <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57234#.WXN1kNPytE5">stated</a> [press release] that he "deeply deplores" the violence between the Palestinians and Israeli security forces, and has called for the deaths of the three Palestinian men to be "fully investigated." </p>

<p>Much of the violence between Palestinians and Israelis stems from the controversial development of settlements in the West Bank. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] alleged that Israel has occupied the West Bank through human rights abuses for the past <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/human-rights-watch-fifty-years-of-human-rights-violations-in-west-bank.php">50 years</a> [JURIST report]. In April, Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">expressed his discontent</a> [JURIST report] with Israel's latest decision to build settlements in the occupied Palestine territory and repeated his previous calls for a two-state solution to resolve the current Israel-Palestine conflict. In March Israel's Security Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/israel-approves-first-new-west-bank-settlement-in-20-years.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to approve the first settlement in the West Bank in more than 20 years.</p>

<p>Added tension between the two groups has resulted from their concurrent claims to various holy sites in Jerusalem, a city with historical significance to all three Abrahamic religions. In March, a UN commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-agency-accuses-israel-apartheid.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] accusing Israel of establishing "an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole." There have been some attempts at reconciliation; however, in March, the Israel High Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/israel-high-court-acknowledges-certain-palestinians-ties-to-jerusalem.php">officially recognized</a> [JURIST report] the ties of several Jerusalem-born Palestinians, calling them "native-born residents," a move which could set precedent for residency rights of Palestinians in the future. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552017/approved/20170721a.html">signed a bill</a> [press release] into law on Friday directing New Jersey school boards to "addres[s] common issues concerning the needs of transgender and LGBTQ students, and to assist schools in establishing policies and procedures that ensure a supportive and nondiscriminatory environment for transgender students." <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S3500/3067_I1.HTM">S-3067/A-4652</a> [text] directs the Commissioner of Education to follow eleven basic guidelines in ensuring transgender and LGBTQ students are ensured a school environment free of discrimination. Those guidelines, among others, include: 1) definitions of terms relevant to an understanding of transgender issues including gender identity, gender expression, and transgender person; 2) maintaining a safe and supportive learning environment free from discrimination and harassment; 3) confidentiality and privacy concerns, including ensuring that school personnel do not disclose information that may reveal a student's transgender status except as allowed by law; 4) issuance of school documentation such as student IDs in the name that corresponds to a student's gender identity; 5) permitting transgender students to dress in accordance with their gender identity; 6) participation in gender-segregated school activities in accordance with a student's gender identity; and 7) use of restrooms and locker rooms, including not requiring a transgender student to use a restroom or locker room that conflicts with the student's gender identity</p>

<p>The transgender community has faced significant legal changes and challenges in the last year. Last month, Oregon <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/gov/Pages/index.aspx">Governor Kate Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/oregon-governor-signs-bill-easing-gender-identification-changes.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that allows for transgender Oregonians to make updates to their birth certificates without publicly doing so through the court system. The same day, California senators approved a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB179">bill</a> [text] in a 26-12 vote that will add a third gender option to state IDs for people who identify as non-binary. In May, the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-senate-revives-bathroom-bill-in-late-night-vote.php">revived</a> [JURIST report] a "bathroom bill" in a 1AM vote, which would require transgender citizens to use public restrooms that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificates. In April, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. In March, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-sends-transgender-bathroom-case-back-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling in a case concerning transgender restroom policies following a move by the Trump administration to rescind guidelines requiring school districts to allow students to use the bathroom of their choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN refugee agency lauds Pakistan&#039;s measures granting legal status to undocumented immigrants</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/07/unhcr/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The office of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2017/7/5971c2284/unhcr-welcomes-registration-million-undocumented-afghans-pakistan.html">report</a> [text] on Friday welcoming a program, almost five years in the works, to register undocumented Afghans living in Pakistan. UNHCR estimates that between 600,000 to one million undocumented Afghans, currently living in Pakistan, will be now able to receive Afghan Citizen (AC) cards. The cards will identify the holder as an Afghan Citizen, and will legally protect them from arbitrary arrests, detention or deportation under <a href="/paperchase/Pakistan%20Foreigners%20Order.pdf">Pakistan Foreigners Order</a> [text, PDF]. The AC cards will allow Afghans to stay in Pakistan until they can be issued documents such as passports by the Government of Afghanistan. This program is a part of Pakistan's Comprehensive Policy on the Repatriation and Management of Afghans, which was <a href="http://unhcrpk.org/2017-making-sustainable-solutions-a-reality-for-afghan-refugees/">passed</a> [UN press release] by the <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.pk/">Pakistan Cabinet</a> [official website]. The program was formally launched on July 20th, and UNHCR spokesperson Duniya Aslam Khan notes it to be a "significant step [that] will help regularize the stay for many Afghans at a time when return to their home country may not be possible."</p>

<p>As the rights of refugee and migrant populations emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, the relationship Pakistan has had with Afghan refugees remained tenuous. In April, the UN reported that cash incentives for Afghan refugees to leave Pakistan were still going to be provided, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-afghan-repatriation-to-continue-with-reduced-cash-incentive.php">even though the amount of the incentives was being reduced</a> [JURIST report]. The amount was originally slated at US $400 and then reduced to US $200; despite these cuts many refugees are continuing to register for repatriation. In February, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Pakistan authorities have driven nearly 600,000 Afghan <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-pakistan-forcefully-removing-afghan-refugees.php">refugees back into Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] since July 2016. HRW also claimed that among those forced out of the country were 365,000 lawfully registered refugees. The use of citizenship as a method to deny or allow the influx of refugees into a country has been widely used. In June, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled unanimously that naturalized citizens <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/scotus-naturalized-citizens-cannot-lose-citizenship-based-on-immaterial-false-statements.php">may not be stripped of their citizenship status</a> [JURIST report] based on false statements that were immaterial to becoming a citizen. In May, a Canada federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/canada-court-rules-citizen-act-violates-immigrant-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that certain provisions of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2014_22/page-1.html">Citizen Act</a> [text] violate principles of fundamental justice under the Canada <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]; the Citizen Act was passed in 2014 and had made eligibility requirements for immigrants seeking citizenship stricter than in the past.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Congress reaches a deal on new Russian sanctions</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House of Representatives and the Senate reached an agreement on Saturday to impose a new sanctions <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/341/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22russia+sanctions%22%5D%7D">bill</a> [materials] on Russia that would give Congress a new veto power in any presidential attempt to roll back the sanctions. The development was brought by both congressional Republicans and Democrats following concerns that President Donald Trump may return two Russian compounds previously taken in response to the cyber attacks surrounding the American election. The bill had previously faced a blue slip constitutional program, which was ironed out through negotiations between the two chambers, leading to a bill that imposes sanctions on Russia, North Korea and Iran. House Minority Whip <a href="https://www.democraticwhip.gov/">Steny Hoyer</a> [gov website] said in a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/22/politics/congress-deal-russia-sanctions/index.html">statement</a> [CNN report], "The legislation ensures that both the majority and minority are able to exercise our oversight role over the administration's implementation of sanctions". The vote on the bill is scheduled for the House on Tuesday. </p>

<p>All three of the countries who will be directly effected by the new sanctions have been subject to numerous American sanctions for a variety of issues over the past decade. All of the countries in one way or another have attempted to get lawmakers to ease sanctions against their respective nations. In May North Korea took a somewhat unprecedented step when it sent a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-sends-letter-to-us-congress-over-sanctions.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to the House over sanctions, a move that is uncommon due to lack of formal negotiation channels between the two countries. Iran has been subject to an array of sanctions, including ones <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/us-treasury-sanctions-iran-prison-company.php">placed on an Iranian prison company</a> [JURIST report] by the US Department of the Treasury in April. Though out of the three nations Russia has been subject to the most sanctions over the years. Back in 2012 a House committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/house-committee-approves-bill-to-sanction-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">approves bill </a> [JURIST report] to sanction Russia officials linked to lawyer's death. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, Poland's upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://www.senat.gov.pl/">Senate</a> [official website], passed a <a href="http://senat.gov.pl/download/gfx/senat/pl/senatdruki/8703/druk/567.pdf">law</a> [PDF, in Polish] that would give the government control over the Supreme Court. The law still <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/23/europe/poland-judicial-bill-protests/index.html">needs to be approved</a> [CNN report] by <a href="http://www.president.pl/en/president/biography/">President Andrzej Duda</a> [official profile]. The law would allow the president to force Supreme Court judges into retirement and appoint new judges. The president has 21 days to approve the law. Proponents of the law say that it is necessary to reform the judiciary system. Opponents of the law say that it removes the independence of the judiciary. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] has called upon Poland to "ensure that any judicial reform does not violate constitution and respects judicial independence." The EU has voiced the possibility of sanctions against Poland if the law is enacted by the president.</p>

<p>Poland has been criticized recently for a number of resolutions which have been accused of undermining democracy in the country. The Supreme Court law was <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/poland-passes-bill-to-allow-parliament-to-appoint-supreme-court-judges.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by Poland's<a href="http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/"> lower house of Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday. In August 2016 Polish prosecutors began an <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/poland-to-investigate-head-of-constitutional-tribunal.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. In June of last year the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-warns-poland-over-constitutional-court-changes.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a warning to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. That February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that grants the <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. In December 2015 the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared the Law and Justice (PiS) party's rise to power in Poland to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, Venezuela's opposition party, <a href="http://www.unidadvenezuela.org/">Unidad Democratica</a> [official website], made a <a href="http://www.unidadvenezuela.org/2017/07/unidad-democratica-anuncio-agenda-acciones-detener-fraude-constituyente-impulsado-maduro/">call</a> [press release, in Spanish] for a 48-hour general strike to be held next Wednesday and Thursday. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-23/venezuela-opposition-calls-for-48-hour-general-strike-next-week">strike</a> [Bloomberg report] comes in response to President Nicolas Maduro's call to rewrite the country's constitution and to elect a new assembly next week. The opposition party had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1A70PW">organized</a> [Reuters report] a separate 24-hour strike earlier this week that involved millions of participants. There are also plans for marches to be held on Monday and Friday. Maduro has accused the opposition party of plotting a coup. The Constituent Assembly has called the election necessary to bring peace to Venezuela.</p>

<p>A non-binding referendum <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier this month in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98% of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to<a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php"> open criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polish <a href="http://www.president.pl/en/">President Andrzej Duda</a> [official website] announced on Monday that he is vetoing two proposed laws that threaten to limit the judiciary's independence. One of the bills, <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/poland-passes-bill-to-allow-parliament-to-appoint-supreme-court-judges.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/">Polish Parliament</a> [official website] last week with two others aimed at judicial reform, would allow members of parliament to appoint Supreme Court judges, a move that many citizens of Poland strongly opposed. The ruling <a href="http://pis.org.pl/">Law and Justice</a> (PiS) party [party website, in Polish] pushed the bill through just days after thousands of people <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/thousands-rally-in-poland-to-protest-judicial-reforms.php">rallied</a> [JURIST report] in Warsaw to protest what has been seen as a massive power-grab by the party. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] threatened to impose sanctions if the proposed bills were not abandoned. Duda, a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40703909">former member</a> [BBC report] of the PiS party, said that he supports a reform of the country's judicial party but that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/world/europe/poland-president-duda-veto-courts.html?_r=0">must increase</a> [NYT report] the people's sense of justice and security. Duda did sign a third bill which gives the justice minster the power to select the heads of the local courts. Parliament could challenge the vetoes, but it will need a three-fifths majority to override the President's decision. </p>

<p>PiS has drawn ire from those in the international community for threatening democracy in Poland. In August 2016 Polish prosecutors began an <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/poland-to-investigate-head-of-constitutional-tribunal.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. In June of last year the European Commission issued a warning to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. That February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. In December 2015 the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ve-profile-leader-idUSBRE9450S520130506">President Nicolás Maduro</a> [Reuters profile] announced on Sunday that a controversial election for a new national assembly will go forth as planned next weekend. The new Constituent Assembly will <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-idINKBN1A80SA">have the power</a> [Reuters report] to rewrite the nation's constitution which was adopted in 1999. Opponents to the move, including the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> [official website] and other Latin American countries, are calling for a boycott of the vote. Many have accused the efforts for a constitutional rewrite to be undemocratic and a way to suppress the months of anti-government protests against Maduro's presidency. Maduro <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article161211773.html">states</a> [Miami Herald report] that the new assembly, which would elect 527 members, is the only solution to bring an end to the anti-government protests that have brought significant violence to the country. Since political unrest erupted four months ago, over 100 people have died and hundreds have been injured. Maduro has also <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-president-threatens-to-imprison-supreme-court-judges/3956351.html">threatened to imprison</a> [VOA report] the Supreme Court judges that were sworn in on Friday by the opposition party. The state intelligence service arrested one of the appointees on Saturday.</p>

<p>Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. Earlier this week Venezuela's opposition party <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike to be held next Wednesday and Thursday in response to the scheduled election. A non-binding <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier this month in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">open criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Massachusetts Supreme Court rules immigrants cannot be detained without charges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/sjc/reporter-of-decisions/new-opinions/12276.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that immigrants cannot be detained solely at the request of federal law enforcement officials. The decision comes out of <span class="casename">Lunn v. Commonwealth</span>, a case concerning a Cambodian refugee who was arrested for unarmed robbery in Boston last October. When the charges were dismissed because the prosecution failed to present a case, federal authorities issued a civil detainer request to hold Lunn for 48 hours until officers could take him into custody and begin the removal process. The court held that the request constitutes as an arrest as the individual in custody would otherwise be released due to a lack of pending charges. Under Massachusetts law, there is no authority to arrest and hold individuals for a civil matter such as an immigration detainer. Associate Justice <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/appealscourt/appeals-court-justices/justice-barbara-a-lenk.html">Barbara Lenk</a> [profile] wrote in the conclusion of the opinion, <blockquote>The prudent course is not for this court to create, and attempt to define, some new authority for court officers to arrest that heretofore has been unrecognized and undefined. The better course is for us to defer to the Legislature to establish and carefully define that authority if the Legislature wishes that to be the law of this Commonwealth.</blockquote> The <a href="https://aclum.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://aclum.org/uncategorized/statement-aclu-massachusetts-ice-detainer-ruling/">praised the decision</a> [press release] as an important precedent and step towards passing the <a href="https://aclum.org/our-work/legislative-priorities/">Safe Communities Act</a> [materials], which is aimed at ensuring state resources are not used to enforce federal immigration law. </p>

<p>Legal issues concerning immigration rights continue to flood the judicial system. Since the election of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">US President Donald Trump</a> [profile], some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities continue to <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Several cases concerning the Trump administration's travel ban have been brought to the federal court system over the last several months, including a request for the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/supreme-court-exempts-grandparents-from-enforcement-of-travel-ban.php">interpret the scope</a> [JURIST report] of the order. In June the <a href="https://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/en/">Texas Civil Rights Project</a> (TCRP) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/civil-rights-group-files-lawsuit-against-texas-anti-immigration-bill.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to challenge a recently passed bill, <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">SB4</a> [text, PDF], which they claim unlawfully targets immigrants and defunds sanctuary cities. In May Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] SB4 into law. Earlier that month the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-agrees-to-reconsider-ruling-blocking-trumps-order-to-defund-sanctuary-cities.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's judiciary chief <a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2017/07/24/1473149/iranian-judiciary-chief-urges-release-of-detained-citizens-in-us">asked</a> [TNA press release] the US Monday to release Iranians jailed in the US and to return Iran's assets after President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-idUSKBN1A62Q3">called on</a> [Reuters report] the state to release three detained US citizens. Iran's Judiciary Chief <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-idUSTRE57E0TV20090815">Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani</a> [Reuters backgrounder] renounced the US claims and brought his own in a televised speech to other top-ranking judicial officials. "We tell them: 'You should immediately release Iranian citizens held in American prisons in violation of international rules and based on baseless charges.' ... You have seized the property of the Islamic Republic of Iran in violation of all rules and in a form of open piracy, and these should be released."</p>

<p>Releations between the US and Iran remain strained. In March Iran <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/iran-imposes-sanctions-on-15-us-companies.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] reciprocal sanctions on 15 US companies after the US sanctioned nations that aided Iran's nuclear program. A bill renewing US sanctions against Iran for another 10 years <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/iran-sanctions-extension-to-become-law-without-obamas-signature.php">became law</a> [JURIST report] last December. In response to renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused the US of breaching the nuclear agreement and ordered the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation to plan the development of nuclear-powered ships. The US House had approved the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/us-house-approves-extension-of-iran-sanctions.php">extension of sanctions</a> [JURIST report] last November. In July 2015 the US entered into the JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran where the county agreed not to create a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-agreement.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] after 20 months of negotiations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57240#.WXZoZVLMyjQ">statement</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/MM/Pages/SRMyanmar.aspx">Yanghee Lee</a> [UN profile] voiced her concern on Monday over the worsening human rights situation in Myanmar. During her 12-day visit at the invitation of the Myanmar government, Lee stated she witnessed government security forces use humans as shields in violent encounters and numerous deaths of detainees while in custody. Lee also voiced concern over the treatment and displacement of 100,000 to 120,000 individuals in the Kachin and Rakhine states after the violent conflict between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims erupted five years ago. According to Lee, the Myanmar government continuously attempted to limit her movements throughout the country during her visit. Lee will present the full report to the UN General Assembly in October. </p>

<p>Human rights violations have been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. In June of last year a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-expert-fundamentalism-harming-rights-to-assembly-and-association.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] a report on religious, free market, political, and nationalist or cultural fundamentalism, stating that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. In November of 2016 a member of the UN High Commission for Refugees <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/troops-in-myanmar-accused-of-atrocities-against-muslim-minority-group.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that the violence is an attempt at "ethnic cleansing" from the government. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that the advocacy organization says has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Philippines <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/profile/">President Rodrigo Duterte</a> [official profile] promised Monday to continue to escalate the war on drugs in his country despite international concern over human rights violations. The war on drugs, which has been a staple aspect of his presidency and his public rhetoric, has been met with strong opposition from the international community, which has pointed to the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-groups-condemn-extrajudicial-killings-in-philippines.php">extrajudicial killings</a> [JURIST report] since Duterte took office. Duterte <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-idUSKBN1A91O6">responded to the critics</a> [Reuters report] by stating that they are "trivializing" his efforts by discussing the need for due process and the protection of human rights. He also added that critics are unjustly laying blame on Philippine authorities for the killings of alleged drug users. </p>

<p>During Duterte's campaign last year, he had stated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/rodrigo-duterte-links-150-judges-and-politicians-to-drugs-trade">100,000 people would die</a> [Guardian report] in his crackdown on crime. In December the UN rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] a murder investigation into Duterte after Duterte stated that he had killed three suspected criminals while he was mayor. In October the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/Home.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/icc-warns-against-the-filipino-presidents-controversial-war-on-drugs.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the rising occurrence of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines in connection with the ongoing war on drugs. In September Duterte declared a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/philippines-president-declares-state-of-lawlessness.php">"state of lawlessness"</a> [JURIST report] in the Philippines, which would allow police and military personnel to frisk individuals and search cars. In August Duterte <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/phillippines-president-names-government-officials-connected-to-illegal-drug-trade.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 150 serving and former state officials connected to the nation's illegal drug trade and ordered them to either surrender to the authorities or risk being hunted down. Duterte has stated that he disregards criticisms from the UN and human rights groups. Also in August Duterte <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/philippines-president-threatens-to-leave-un-following-criticism.php">threatened to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] the country from the UN following criticisms against his controversial crackdown on illegal drugs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal district judge on Monday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1320-40">allowed</a> [opinion, PDF] President Donald Trump's election commission to move forward by dismissing the need for a prior privacy impact assessment before collecting voter data. <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly">US District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly</a> [official profile] denied a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction <a href="paperchase/2017/07/advocacy-group-seeks-to-block-trump-voter-information-request.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] by Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) against the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (PACEI). Kollar-Kotelly determined that only agencies must go through a privacy impact assessment required by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opcl/e-government-act-2002">E-Government Act, § 208(b)</a> [DOJ background]. "The record presently before the Court is insufficient to demonstrate that the Commission is an 'agency' for purposes of the APA. First, the Executive Order indicates that the Commission is purely advisory in nature, and that it shall disband shortly after it delivers a report to the President."</p>

<p>Trump established PACEI in May via <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/presidential-executive-order-establishment-presidential-advisory">executive order</a> [text] . Earlier this month PACEI Vice Chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach sent out a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/06.28.17_Kobach_Letter_to_States.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] requesting voter information from all 50 states. A majority of the states rejected that request. Like EPIC, the ACLU also <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/aclu-sues-trumps-vote-fraud-commission-for-violating-federal-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children">issued an expansive report</a> [press release] on Tuesday calling for a "moratorium" on surgeries designed to "normalize" intersex children, those who are "are born with chromosomes, gonads, sex organs, or genitalia that differ from those seen as socially typical for boys and girls." The 160-page report, titled <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us">"I Want to be Like Nature Made Me: Medically Unnecessary Surgeries on Intersex Children in the United State"</a> [text], is the product of a collaborative effort by HRW and <a href="https://interactadvocates.org/">interACT</a> [advocacy website], an advocacy group. The report claims that as many as 1.7 percent of babies are "different from what is typically called a boy or a girl," a condition once referred to as being a "hermaphrodite," a term now considered pejorative and outdated. Researchers for HRW and interSEX interviewed "intersex adults, parents of intersex children, and medical practitioners working with intersex people" during their study. The report concludes that children who are "too young" to participate in a decision regarding whether to undergo surgery with permanent and often painful surgery should not be subjected to such surgeries, despite a physician's recommendation that the surgery could lead to less "bullying and harassment" from peers.<blockquote>"[We] believe that this approach has it exactly backwards: the experience of those who have undergone the surgery and principles of medical ethics suggest that unless and until there is outcome data establishing that the medical benefits of specific surgical procedures on infants and young children outweigh the potential harms, they should not be used. Accordingly, Human Rights Watch and interACT are urging a moratorium on all surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred.</blockquote>Many challenges related to individuals identified as intersex, including the recognition of "intersex" as a gender status, have emerged in recent years. <a href="http://arc-international.net/about/about-arvind-narrain-geneva-director/">Arvind Narrain</a> [official profile] of ARC International <a href="/hotline/2015/10/arvind-narrain-intersex-justice.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] about gender assignment of intersex-born children in 2015. Belgian-born Model Hanne Gaby Odiele, who recently revealed that <a href="https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2017/7/24/unstoppable-rise-intersex-supermodel-hanne-gaby-odiele">she was born intersex</a> [<em>OUT</em> magazine report], has given several interviews in an effort to raise awareness about the "least discussed letter... in the LGBTQI acronym." Earlier this month, an individual in Colorado made headlines when is was revealed that they ('they' being the individual's preferred pronoun) had been <a href="http://www.abc2news.com/news/national/intersex-person-suing-again-for-passport">denied a US passport</a> [ABC affiliate report] due to their status as an intersex individual. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian court sentenced 43 individuals to life in prison Tuesday for crimes of vandalism, rioting and attacking Egyptian authorities. The acts for which the protesters were convicted took place in 2011, among an outbreak of demonstrations against then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile]. The defendants were also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-court-idUSKBN1AA1MN">fined</a> [Reuters report] 17 million Egyptian pounds. Ten other protesters were handed down lesser sentences of five or ten years, 96 protesters were acquitted of their charges. The convicted parties may appeal their sentences. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a>  [JURIST backgrounder] sparked a string of legal proceedings, many of which are still playing out. In April a Cairo criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] leader Wagdy Ghoneim to death, in absentia. In March Mubarak  was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/egypt-former-president-hosni-mubarak-released-from-prison.php">released</a> from prison after six years in custody after he was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/top-egypt-court-acquits-ex-president-mubarak-of-2011-killings.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST reports] in a retrial of charges that he killed protesters during the civil uprising in 2011 that ended his 30-year reign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3900192/7-25-17-DC-Circuit-Wrenn.pdf">rejected</a> [text, PDF] a DC legal restriction that required an applicant to have "good reason to fear for their person or property" in order to acquire a concealed carry permit. The law was blocked by a 2-1 vote. The opinion stated that the "good reason" law is equivalent to a total ban on an enumerated right. According to the decision, "the Second Amendment's core lies the right of responsible citizens to carry firearms for personal self-defense beyond the home, subject to longstanding restrictions." The court remanded the case with the instructions to order a permanent injunction on the law.</p>

<p>Gun ownership and carry rights have become an increasingly prevalent issue. In June Kansas Governor Sam Brownback <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/kansas-governor-allows-concealed-carry-bill-to-become-law.php">allowed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that permits public hospitals, mental health facilities and other health-providing facilities to ban concealed weapons, to become law on without his signature.In April Iowa Governor Terry Branstad signed <a href="paperchase/2017/04/iowa-governor-signs-law-expanding-gun-rights.php">legislation</a> [JURIST report] expanding gun rights in the state. Earlier that week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing individuals over the age of 21 to get enhanced concealed carry permits which will allow them to carry concealed weapons at public colleges, airports, polling places, sporting events, some state offices and the state capitol.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text">bill</a> [text] Tuesday regarding sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, with a <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll413.xml">vote</a> [vote record] of 419-3. The sanctions against Iran are for the country's ballistic missile program, terrorism related activities and human rights violations. The sanctions against Russia are for human rights abuses, undermining cybersecurity, and providing weapons to Syria, and strengthen the sanctions under the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ272/pdf/PLAW-113publ272.pdf">Ukraine Freedom Act of 2014</a> [text, PDF]. The North Korean sanctions expand the sanctions under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title22-chapter99&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjIyIHNlY3Rpb246OTIwMiBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSk%3D%7C%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim&edition=prelim">North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016</a> [text], including adding sanctions for providing rockets or significant amounts of specific elements. The EU has issued a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/europe/russia-us-sanctions/index.html">warning</a> [CNN report] against the US regarding the proposed sanctions against Russia. The EU has concerns that the sanctions could impact the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Section 232 of the House bill allows sanctions against those who makes an investment that " directly and significantly contributes to the enhancement of the ability of the Russian Federation to construct energy export pipelines," or provides support that "could directly and significantly facilitate the maintenance or expansion of the construction, modernization, or repair of energy export pipelines by the Russian Federation." US Senator Bob Corker has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/russia-sanctions-bill-congress/index.html">stated</a> [CNN report] that he will attempt to strip the North Korean sanctions out of the bill and have those sanctions voted on separately.</p>

<p>In March the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice</a> [Official Website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the European Union's sanctions against Russia were valid. The situation involving Russia and Ukraine has been a source of conflict since Russia's<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA2K0MC20140321"> annexation of Crimea</a> [Reuters backgrounder] in March 2014. The United States <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-expands-sanctions-on-north-korea-for-human-rights-violations.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] sanctions against North Korea in January due to human rights violations. In March 2016 the Obama administration also<a href="/paperchase/2016/07/us-sanctions-north-korea-leader-for-human-rights-violations.php"> issued sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against North Korea for their recent actions of nuclear and ballistic missile testing. A US bill renewing sanctions against Iran was <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/iran-sanctions-extension-to-become-law-without-obamas-signature.php">enacted into law</a> [JURIST report] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zimbabwe's parliament on Monday voted to amend its constitution to empower the president to handpick the nation's top judges. With this amendment, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Mugabe">President Robert Mugabe</a> [Britannica profile] will have substantially <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/zimbabwes-new-law-on-judges-angers-mugabe-critics/">greater power</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] than he did under the 2013 constitution. Under the previous version, the president's power in selecting top judges was limited, as he could only choose justices from the judiciary services commission's list of candidates. The decision sparked political tensions in Zimbabwe, since many who oppose an authoritarian government have made great strides in recent years to democratize the country. </p>

<p>The amendment comes from the 2013 battle between <a href="http://www.zanupf.org.zw">Zanu-PF</a> [official website] and the opposition parties, regarding government authority. Mugabe's presidency has only increased the tension in the last year. In February Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court rejected a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/zimbabwe-court-dismisses-challenge-to-mugabe-presidency.php">case</a> [JURIST article] alleging that Mugabe is unfit to hold office because of his age, holding that the applicant failed to follow proper court filing procedures. In October the Harare High Court in Zimbabwe <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/zimbabwe-court-upholds-ban-on-protests.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a 30-day ban against protests in the capital, despite calls from Amnesty International for the ban to be lifted. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>European Court: Austria and Slovenia can deport refugees to Croatia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-07/cp170086en.pdf">ruled</a> [press release, PDF] Wednesday in favor of Austria and Slovenia's deportation of refugees to Croatia, thereby requiring asylum-seekers to return to the first EU member state in which they arrive. In upholding these so-called Dublin Regulations, the court permitted nations to deport refugees who entered through an EU border state. In making this decision, the court also noted that under the Schengen Borders Code, states may also permit non-EU refugees that fail to meet state travel laws regulations, to enter the nation. Concerning this determination, the court noted: <blockquote>If it were accepted that the entry of a non-EU national authorized by a Member State on  humanitarian  grounds by way of derogation from the entry conditions generally imposed on such nationals does not constitute an irregular crossing of the border, that would imply that the member state is not responsible for examining the application for international protection lodged by that person in another member state.</blockquote>The case arose when a Serbian man and two Afghan families, who entered the EU through to return to Croatia, were deported back to Croatia to seek asylum.</p>

<p>The rights of refugee and migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. In January the Slovenian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-slovenia-strips-refugees-of-protections.php">passed amendments to the Aliens Act</a> [JURIST report] to enact emergency measures to deny refugees entry into the country and to expel those whom did not have their asylum claims properly assessed. Last September Austria <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/austria-threatens-lawsuit-against-hungary-over-migrant-acceptance.php">threatened legal action</a> [JURIST report] against Hungary if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Texas Senate advances &#039;bathroom bill&#039;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.senate.texas.gov/">Texas Senate</a> [official website] voted Tuesday to advance <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/851/billtext/pdf/SB00003E.pdf#navpanes=0">SB 3</a> [text, PDF], which has been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/07/25/texas-senate-votes-advance-bathroom-bill-again/">referred</a> [Texas Tribune report] to as the "bathroom bill." The bill requires persons using multi-occupancy restrooms, showers and changing facilities in a political subdivision, which includes public and open-charter schools, to use the restroom which matches the sex designated on their birth certificate or driver's license, personal identification certificate or license to carry a handgun. The bill also disallows a person whose birth certificate designates them as a male to participate in athletic activities designated for females. The bill was passed by a vote of 21-10.  It will next be sent to the <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] for consideration. Democrats had questioned the bill's constitutionality, potential costs from event cancellations and discrimination against transgender people. The bill is similar to a bill that was voted in March, except the old bill also included state buildings and public universities.</p>

<p>Transgender rights has been an important topic in several states throughout the US. Earlier this month New Jersey <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/nj-governor-christie-signs-bill-directing-school-boards-to-recognize-transgender-rights.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a law directing schools to recognize transgender rights. In March 11 states <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/states-withdraw-lawsuit-over-transgender-bathroom-executive-order-after-trump-repeals.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the US government after Obama's bathroom guidance was overturned. The bathroom guidance was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by the Trump administration in February. A Pennsylvania judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-federal-judge-rules-transgender-students-can-use-bathroom-of-choice.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in February that transgender students could use the bathroom of their choice. In May 2016 Massachusetts Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/massachusetts-senate-passes-transgender-rights-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a bill aimed at protecting transgender people from discrimination. In February 2016 South Dakota's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/south-dakota-senate-approves-transgender-bathroom-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a bill that prevented opposite-sex bathroom use in public schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DOJ: Title VII does not protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed an <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2017/07/Zarda-DOJ-brief.pdf">amicus curiae brief</a> [PDF] on Wednesday urging the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a man who claims he was fired for his sexual orientation. Donald Zarda alleges that his employment as a skydiving instructor with Altitude Express Inc was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-lgbt-idUSKBN1AC2DZ">terminated</a> [Reuters report] after he told a customer that he was gay. The DOJ argues that <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [materials], which bans sexual discrimination in the workplace, does not extend to protect against discrimination of sexual orientation where there is "no showing that an employer has treated 'similarly situated employees' of different sexes unequally." The brief contends that discrimination based on sexual orientation does not "involve the disparate treatment of men and women" because "it causes differential treatment of gay and straight employees for men and women alike." Until the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's recent landmark decision in <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/appeals-court-rules-lgbt-employees-protected-under-civil-rights-act.php">Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College</a> [JURIST report], there was a "settled precedent holding" that discrimination based on sexual orientation was not prohibited under Title VII. Additionally, the brief continues,<blockquote>Against the backdrop of that precedent, Congress neither added sexual orientation as a protected trait nor defined discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation discrimination&#8212;notwithstanding that Congress amended the provisions concerning sex discrimination in other respects and overruled numerous other judicial precedents with which it disagreed. In fact, every Congress from 1974 to the present has declined to enact proposed legislation that would prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation. </blockquote>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/jeff-sessions-thinks-it-should-be-legal-fire-you-being-lgbt">called</a> [press release] the move "disgraceful" and vowed "to continue this fight to make clear that discrimination against LGBT people is just another form of sex discrimination that is prohibited under federal civil rights laws."</p>

<p>LGBT protections are still disputed and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. The Supreme Court of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/texas-supreme-court-denies-benefits-to-same-sex-couples.php">held</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that the Houston's benefits policy need not extend to same-sex couples In June the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-court-lifts-injunction-on-controversial-mississippi-religious-objection-bill.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a Mississippi law that critics say allows individuals, including government employees, to discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people for religious reasons. Also in June the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-north-carolina-same-sex-marriage-recusal-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's Senate Bill 2, which allows magistrates to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if doing so would conflict with their religious beliefs. In May the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. In February the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-citys-lgbt-protections.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Fayetteville city ordinance broadening nondiscrimination laws to include sexual orientation or gender identity was invalid under a state statute that prohibited cities from adopting or enforcing ordinances prohibiting discrimination beyond what is barred by state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the <a href="http://www.korea-dpr.com">Demoractic People's Republic of Korea</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/KP/Pages/TomasOjeaQuintana.aspx">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile], is <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57260#.WXpnd1LMyjQ">asking</a> [press release] North and South Korea to open discussions concerning human rights following his second visit to South Korea. Quintana argued the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/world/asia/north-korea-south-military-talks.html?_r=0">proposed the resumption of communication between the two nations</a> [NYT report] will present an opportunity for more open discussions on not only military issue, but humanitarian ones as well. Quintana's recommendation comes after a five-day trip to South Korea where he met with numerous government officials as well as the leaders of numerous representatives from humanitarian groups. North Korea denied his requests for access to the country. Quintana voiced concern over the increase of North Koreans being found in China to then be deported back to North Korea where they will likely face harsh labor sentences. As a result, Quintana also asked China to stop its policy of deporting North Koreans that are found within their borders. A full report is expected to be presented to the UN General Assembly sometime in October. </p>

<p>North Korea is well known for human rights violations, which has led to frequent sanctions. Last month Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-international-community-to-refer-north-korea-to-icc.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UNHRC and the UN member states to bring human rights violations committed by North Korea before the International Criminal Court and address "the grave human rights situation" in the country. Earlier that month <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website], an "independent watchdog organization," <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/north-korea-ranked-worst-of-the-worst-for-political-freedom-civil-liberties.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its 2017 "Freedom in the World" report, listing North Korea as one of the least-free nations in the world. In January the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-expands-sanctions-on-north-korea-for-human-rights-violations.php">expanded sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against North Korea for alleged human rights violations, adding eight North Korean government officials to the Specially Designated Nationals List. Kim Jong-un and 10 other high ranking officials were <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/us-sanctions-north-korea-leader-for-human-rights-violations.php">placed on the list </a>[JURIST report] in July after the release of the report detailing the human rights violations in the country. In December, the Institute for National Security Strategy <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/kim-jong-un-story.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] asserting that Kim ordered the executions of 340 people in the five years that he has been in power. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, the leader of a militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), turned himself in to <a href="https://monusco.unmissions.org/en">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo</a> (MONUSCO) [official website] on Wednesday. The DRC took out a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-security-idUSKBN1AB22X">warrant</a> [Reuters report] for Sheka's arrest in 2011 after his forces allegedly raped at least 387 civilians during a four-day period in 2010. The militia is also accused of murdering 70 civilians between 2010 and 2015. The UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/1533/materials/summaries/individual/ntabo-ntaberi-sheka">sanctioned</a> [UN database] Sheka in 2011 for war crimes, including mass rapes and crimes against children. MONUSCO <a href="https://monusco.unmissions.org/en/wanted-crimes-against-humanity-rebel-sheka-surrendered-monusco-today-north-kivu">said</a> [press release] that Sheka surrendered in <correction num=1>Mutongo</correction>, approximately 10 km North of Walikale, North Kivu, and has since been transferred to Goma to stand trial eventually. He is fully aware of the charges against him, but it is unclear why he surrendered.  </p>

<p>Violence in the Congo has plagued the nations for years. Earlier this week the UN human rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-independent-investigation-in-drcs-kasai-province.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into the DRC's Kasai Province. In May the President of the DRC's electoral commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/congo-election-group-violence-may-delay-vote.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the presidential election may be postponed due to sectarian violence. In April a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-more-drc-refugees-migrating-to-angola-to-escape-violence.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that more than 11,000 refugees from the Kasai province had escaped to Angola due to violence in their province. The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) released a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/icc-violence-in-drc-could-be-war-crimes.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] in April alleging that recent acts of violence in the DRC could amount to war crimes. In March UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-human-rights-investigators-killed-in-the-drc.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the remains of two human rights investigators were found in the DRC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ilga.org">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://ilga.org/downloads/2017/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2017_WEB.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] stating that same-sex relationships are still illegal in 72 countries around the world. The report identifies these 72 nations as "criminalising States" or countries where gay individuals can face legal ramifications if their relationships are disclosed. Out of these 72 countries, anti-gay legislation is applied equally to men and women in 45 nations. The report also states that four nations apply the death penalty to identified homosexuals while eight other states "allow" the death penalty but do not apply it in every instance. Southern Asia, eastern and southern Africa, and the Middle East were found to be the most violent and hostile regions while western Europe and the whole of the Western hemisphere was found to be significantly more tolerant of gay relationships. </p>

<p>LGBT protections are still disputed and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. The Supreme Court of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/texas-supreme-court-denies-benefits-to-same-sex-couples.php">held</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that the Houston's benefits policy need not extend to same-sex couples In June the US Court of Appeals for the <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-court-lifts-injunction-on-controversial-mississippi-religious-objection-bill.php">Fifth Circuit lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a Mississippi law that critics say allows individuals, including government employees, to discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people for religious reasons. Also in June the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-north-carolina-same-sex-marriage-recusal-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's Senate Bill 2, which allows magistrates to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if doing so would conflict with their religious beliefs. In May the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. In February the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-citys-lgbt-protections.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Fayetteville city ordinance broadening non-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation or gender identity was invalid under a state statute that prohibited cities from adopting or enforcing ordinances prohibiting discrimination beyond what is barred by state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A Mendoza court sentenced four former federal judges to life in prison for crimes against humanity carried out during Argentina's 1976-1983 dictatorship. The judges were originally <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/article163870658.html">tried</a> [AP report] as accomplices for <a href="http://www.mendozapost.com/nota/67963-los-exjueces-mendocinos-condenados-a-prision-perpetua/">failure to investigate</a> [<em>Mendoza Post</em> report, in Spanish] the kidnapping, torture and murder of dissenters. The prosecutors eventually charged the judges as principals arguing that the judges' "inaction on the petitions preceded the disappearance of more than 20 dissidents." The sentence has been applauded by several human rights groups, including the <a href="https://abuelas.org.ar/idiomas/english/history.htm">Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo</a> [advocacy website], which has advocated for civilian perpetrators being brought to justice for their role during the last dictatorship. </p>

<p>Former participants of former dictatorship of South America have been held accountable for their past crimes in the last decade. In August an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/argentina-court-convicts-military-officers-of-human-rights-violations-during-dictatorship.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] military officers of human rights violations during the dictatorship. In May 2016 Argentina's last dictator, Reynaldo Bignone, and other former military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-argentina-dictator-and-military-leaders-sentenced-to-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to prison for their roles in Operation Condor in the 1970s. In February 2016, France's highest appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/france-high-court-stays-extradition-of-argentine-ex-police-officer.php">overtured</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to seek the extradition of a former police officer to Argentina for alleged crimes against humanity during the country's "dirty war."  In 2014, a Buenos Aires court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/argentina-ex-dictator-receives-additional-sentence.php">handed</a> [JURIST report] down a 23-year prison sentence to Bignone, the last Argentinian military president of the country's dictatorship, for the kidnapping and torture of 32 factory workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22167511">Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-pakistan-sharif-20170728-story.html">resigned from office</a> [LA Times report] on Friday after the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/Khan%20v.%20Sharif.pdf">unanimous ruling</a> [order, PDF], earlier the same day, disqualifying him from office. Sharif was before the Court due to allegations of corruption surfacing after the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36092356">Panama Papers</a> [BBC backgrounder] leak. The leaked documents suggested that Sharif's children had offshore assets that were not disclosed in the family's wealth statement and led to further investigation by a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprised of officials from the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/en/index.php">Federal Investigation Agency</a> (FIA), <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> (NAB), the <a href="http://www.sbp.org.pk/">State Bank of Pakistan</a>, and the <a href="https://www.secp.gov.pk/">Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan</a> [official websites], among others. Based on the results of that investigation, the Court found that the assets of Sharif and his children were disproportionate to their reported sources of income, which disqualified Sharif from holding public office under the <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/Downloads/nao.asp#Corruption_12">NAB Ordinance</a> [materials, text]. The Court ordered:</p>

<blockquote>It is hereby declared that having failed to disclose his un-withdrawn receivables constituting assets from Capital FZE, Jebel Ali, UAE in his nomination papers filed for the General Elections held in 2013 in terms of Section 12(2)(f) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 (ROPA), and having furnished a false declaration under solemn affirmation respondent No. 1 Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif is not honest in terms of Section 99(f) of ROPA and Article 62(1)(f) of the <a href="http://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1333523681_951.pdf">Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</a> [text, PDF], 1973, therefore, he is disqualified to be a Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) ... The Election Commission of Pakistan shall issue a notification disqualifying respondent No. 1 Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif from being a Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) with immediate effect, whereafter he shall cease to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan.</blockquote>

<p>Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Pakistan's petroleum minister and a loyalist of the Sharif administration, has currently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/longtime-pakistani-lawmaker-chosen-to-be-interim-prime-minister/2017/07/29/1aef9a32-748a-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.600e5c830281">assumed office as interim prime minister</a> [WP report].</p>

<p>Pakistan has been under intense scrutiny in recent months, both at the domestic and international level. The Supreme Court ruling and Sharif's subsequent resignation follows <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/pakistan-opposition-parties-call-for-supreme-court-to-remove-pm.php">calls for Sharif's removal</a> [JURIST report], earlier this month, by opposition parties in Pakistan after the JIT report was released. In April, a Pakistan military court sentenced<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav-the-hindu-explains/article17907888.ece"> Kulbushan Jadhav </a> [The Hindu backgrounder], an Indian naval officer who was detained in Pakistan for the past year, to death. The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php"> handed down </a> [JURIST report] the death sentence after finding Jadhav guilty of espionage and sabotage. However, in May, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/icj-calls-for-pakistan-to-delay-execution-of-accused-india-spy.php"> instructed Pakistan </a> [JURIST report] to withhold the execution until the international court reaches its final decision. In March, the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">Pakistan National Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/pakistan-assembly-votes-to-continue-use-of-military-courts-on-terrorism-suspects.php"> voted </a> [JURIST report] to renew an amendment to the country's constitution that allows military tribunals to oversee civilians accused of terrorist-related crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00175">98-2 vote</a> [vote count, text], the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] on Thursday passed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr3364/BILLS-115hr3364enr.pdf">H.R. 3364</a> [text, PDF], a bill that imposes new sanctions on Russia. This development comes two days after the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/house-of-representatives-overwhelmingly-pass-bill-for-sanctions-against-russia-iran-and-north-korea.php">overwhelmingly passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill. The sanctions imposed on Russia are for, among others, human rights abuses, malicious cyber-hacking and undermining cybersecurity, providing weapons to Syria, and undermining the democratic process and threatening peace, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Additionally, the bill includes a provision that would require <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] to obtain the approval of <a href="http://www.congress.gov">Congress</a> [official website] before he would be able to ease sanctions against Russia. Speaking in favor of the bill, Republican <a href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/">Senator John McCain</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sanctions-idUSKBN1AC1U8">stated</a> [Reuters report]: "The United States of America needs to send a strong message to <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy." Putin has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sanctions-idUSKBN1AC1U8">threatened retaliation</a> [Reuters report] in response to the bill, stating that the sanctions are "absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law." However, Russia is not the only member of the international community concerned about this legislation. The EU <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sanctions-idUSKBN1AC1U8">expressed its own concern</a> [Reuters report] that the sanctions might affect its energy security, and some expressed concern that the sanctions could impact the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. The bill also imposes sanctions against North Korea and Iran. It will now proceed to Trump's desk for his signature or veto. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] has indicated that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/us/trump-to-sign-russia-sanctions-bill-white-house-says.html">Trump will sign the bill</a> [NYT report].</p>

<p>US and international sanctions on the three countries mentioned above have been on ongoing subject in the last several months.  In March, the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice</a> [official Website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU sanctions against Russia were valid. The situation involving Russia and Ukraine has been a source of conflict since <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA2K0MC20140321">Russia's annexation of Crimea</a> [Reuters backgrounder] in March 2014. In January, the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-expands-sanctions-on-north-korea-for-human-rights-violations.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] sanctions against North Korea for human rights violations. In March 2016, the Obama administration also <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/us-sanctions-north-korea-leader-for-human-rights-violations.php">issued sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against North Korea for its continued nuclear and ballistic missile testing. In December 2016, a US bill renewing sanctions against Iran for an additional ten years was <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/iran-sanctions-extension-to-become-law-without-obamas-signature.php">enacted into law</a> [JURIST report], without then president <a href="https://barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a>'s [official website] signature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Foreign ministers from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates stated on Sunday that the four nations are open to dialogue with Qatar regarding the <a href="https://apnews.com/3a58461737c44ad58047562e48f46e06/List-of-demands-on-Qatar-by-Saudi-Arabia,-other-Arab-nations">13 demands</a> [AP, materials] imposed against the Gulf state early last month.  The demands against Qatar were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-meeting-idUSKBN1AF03T">prompted</a> [Reuters report] by allegations that Qatar condones and funds terrorist activity. During a joint news conference held in Manama, Bahrain's foreign minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, called on Qatar to "announces its sincere willingness to stop funding terrorism and extremism and its commitment to not interfere in other countries' foreign affairs and respond to the 13 demands." Qatar responded, however, by accusing the four nations of violating international law by enforcing their recent sanctions. The Saudi countries are expected to continue enforcing sanctions and restrict travel to Qatar until Qatar has changed their policies to meet their demands. </p>

<p>While these four Arab countries have called on Qatar to clean up its act, they have also received criticism recently. Earlier in June, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/amnesty-accuses-bahrain-of-taking-step-towards-total-suppression-of-human-rights.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Bahrain of moving toward a total suppression of human rights after a major political party in opposition to the government was dissolved. In May, Saudi Arabia was <br />
<a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-saudis-demolition-of-historic-neighborhood-violates-human-rights.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of violating human rights for demolishing a culturally significant neighborhood. Earlier in May, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Ben Emmerson, <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-expert-saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-policies-threaten-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights. In March, Bahrain's upper house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would allow military trials for civilians accused of being involved in terrorism plots. In July 2016, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-egypt-security-forces-have-abducted-and-tortured-hundreds.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that hundreds of Egyptians had been abducted and tortured by Egypt's National Security Agency during a crackdown on political activists and protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Violent protests in Venezuela broke out on Sunday as the nation held a controversial election for a new assembly that would have the power to rewrite the nation's constitution. Activists <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1AE0JO">clashed</a> [Reuters report] with security forces in retaliation against the bill, resulting in at least seven deaths.  Venezuela <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ve-profile-leader-idUSBRE9450S520130506">President Nicolás Maduro's </a> [Reuters profile] has claimed that the new Constituent Assembly, which would elect 527 members, is the <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuela-president-move-forward-with-plan-for-constitutional-rewrite.php">only solution</a> [JURIST report] to bring an end to the anti-government protests that have brought significant violence to the country. Critics have accused Maduro of plotting to dissolve the opposition-controlled Congress and change laws to solidify his party's power in the government. In an effort to show their disapproval of the new assembly, the public largely boycotted Sunday's election, with polling stations being reported as mostly empty. The opposition has expressed their intention to increase their resistance against the Maduro administration. </p>

<p>Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. Earlier this week Venezuela's opposition party <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike to be held next Wednesday and Thursday in response to the scheduled election. A non-binding <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier this month in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">open criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Austrian court in the <a href="https://www.justiz.gv.at/web2013/lg_feldkirch/landesgericht_feldkirch~2c9484853f08c7f1013f141584715a73.de.html">District of Feldkirch</a> [official website] found a man guilty of violating the country's anti-Nazi laws on Monday for his claims that the mass killing of Jews in gas chambers is a fictitious story. Austria's <a href="http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10000207">Prohibition Act of 1947</a> [materials, in German] provided a legal framework for the denazification of Austria. In 1992 it was amended to prohibit Holocaust denial and the belittlement of the atrocities carried out by the Nazi party. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/austria-court-convicts-man-who-questioned-gassing-of-jews/2017/07/31/77542980-75ea-11e7-8c17-533c52b2f014_story.html?utm_term=.8880aec91617">34-year-old man</a> [AP report], whose identity is kept private under Austrian law, made <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [official website] posts asserting that Jews made up stories about mass killings in gas chambers to taint Adolf Hitler's image should he have won the war. Additionally, the man was convicted of incitement for a separate post he made calling Muslims "vermin". The court ordered him to pay a fine of 1,440 euros ($1,690) and sentenced him to a suspended one-year prison term.</p>

<p>Efforts to seek justice and restitution for the victims of the Nazi Germany era are still underway, over 70 years after the close of World War II. Earlier this month Poland's special prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/poland-seeks-extradition-of-minnesota-man-accused-of-nazi-war-crimes.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the US extradite a Minnesota man accused of Nazi war crimes. Also in July the <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/index.de.html">Austria Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/austrian-court-government-acted-legally-in-seizing-home-where-hitler-was-born.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government seizure of the apartment complex where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born is constitutional. In May Romania <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/romania-enacts-legislation-enabling-restitution-for-holocaust-survivors.php">enacted legislation</a> [JURIST report] enabling restitution for Holocaust survivors. In November 2016 the Germany Federal Court of Justice upheld the conviction of former Nazi SS Officer <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32336353">Oskar Groening</a> [BBC profile], known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," for his role in the deaths of over 300,000 people during the Holocaust. Two months earlier the Neubrandenburg state court in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-begins-trial-of-95-year-old-former-ss-medic.php">started the trial</a> [JURIST report] of a 95-year-old former SS medic who served at the Auschwitz camp. The same month a court in Kiel, Germany, ruled that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-rules-92-year-old-woman-unfit-to-stand-trial-for-auschwitz-deaths.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. Prior to 2011 German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/germany-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-nazi-officer.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7998947.stm">John Demjanjuk</a> [BBC profile] may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of UN experts for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21926&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the government of the Philippines on Monday to address reports of human rights violations that include threats against indigenous people, murder and the summary execution of children. The experts stated in a joint call for action, "We are shocked by the increasing levels of violence, killings, intimidation and harassment being suffered by human rights defenders&#8212;including those protecting indigenous peoples&#8212;trade union organizers, farmers and their family members." Predominantly among those attacked were individuals who were protecting the rights of the Lumad indigenous peoples of Mindanao island. The Lumad have been subjected to severe threats such as <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/profile/">President Rodrigo Duterte's</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/26/philippines-duterte-threatens-to-bomb-indigenous-schools">call for an attack</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] on tribal schools. The group of experts have contacted the government of the Philippines concerning the reports.</p>

<p>The Philippines have been on the international spotlight ever since Duterte took office as the president. During Duterte's campaign last year, he had stated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/rodrigo-duterte-links-150-judges-and-politicians-to-drugs-trade">100,000 people would die</a> [Guardian report] in his crackdown on crime. Duterte promised last week to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/philippine-president-promises-escalating-war-on-drugs-despite-international-human-rights-concerns---.php">continue to escalate</a> [JURIST report] the war on drugs in his country despite international concern over human rights violations. Earlier in July Duterte asked Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/philippines-president-asks-congress-to-extend-martial-law-until-end-of-year.php">extend</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/philippines-president-declares-martial-law-as-militants-invade-marawi-city.php">order of martial law</a> [JURIST reports] for the lower third of the country. Also in July the Philippines <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/">Office of the Ombudsman</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/former-philippine-president-to-be-charged-with-usurpation-because-of-botched-raid.php">announced plans to charge</a> [JURIST report] former Philippines president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benigno-Aquino-III">Benigno Aquino III</a> [Britannica profile] for the botched "anti-terror" raid that led to what is known as the Mamasapano massacre in 2015. In June Philippine opposition lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/philippine-lawmakers-petition-supreme-court-to-end-president-dutertes-martial-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reject President Rodrigo Duterte's imposition of martial law. In April a lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/lawyer-files-icc-complaint-against-phillipines-president-over-alleged-death-squad.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Duterte accusing him of extrajudicial killings during his nationwide anti-drugs crackdown. In March the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">accusing the police of falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">called for a murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] after Duterte admitted to killing people while he served as mayor of Davao.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/you-and-the-judiciary/going-to-court/high-court/">UK High Court</a> [official website]<a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-al-rabbat-v-westminster-magistrates-court.pdf">rejected</a> [judgment, PDF] a "crime of aggression" allegation Monday against former UK Prime Minister <a href="http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/">Tony Blair</a> [official website] by a former Iraq General Abdul Wahed Shannan Al Rabbat. The two justices dismissed the claim as UK law does not recognize a crime of aggression:<blockquote>The existence of such difficulties cannot in any way justify the domestic courts of England and Wales departing from the clear principle that it is for Parliament to make such conduct criminal under domestic law. Parliament deliberately chose not to do so. The courts cannot usurp that function. It is for Parliament and Parliament alone to make the decision. Furthermore, there is no answer to the practical and constitutional difficulties identified by Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffman that would arise if a prosecution was brought without clear statutory provision.</blockquote>The matter was dismissed before it could be brought to the Supreme Court for judicial review, the High Court determining that the highest court in Britain would not break away from its ruling in <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-2.htm">R v. Jones</a> [judgment].</p>

<p>This ruling comes at the end of a long line of investigations into the <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">Iraq War</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The Chilcot inquiry in July 2016 determined that the UK's entry into the Iraq War was <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-entry-into-iraq-war-not-justified-report.php">not justified</a> [JURIST report]. The same month the ICC determined that it <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/icc-will-not-prosecute-tony-blair-for-war-crimes-over-iraq-war.php">would not prosecute</a> [JURIST report] Tony Blair for crimes related to the Iraq War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The French government and the Calais region are to furnish water and sanitation to migrants in the area, France's highest administrative court, the <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/">Conseil D'Etat</a> [official website, in French] <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/Conseil-d-Etat-31-juillet-2017-Commune-de-Calais-Ministre-d-Etat-ministre-de-l-Interieur">ruled</a> [judgment, in French] Monday. The county has said that it will also open two new reception centers about an hour from Calais in Bailleul and Troisva. These immigrants are primarily on their way to the UK but face rough conditions that were heavily criticized in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/france-court-allows-closure-of-migrant-camp.php">"Jungle" migrant camp</a> [JURIST report] in October. France's Interior Minister <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/ministre/gerard-collomb">Gerard Collomb</a> [official profile, in French] also called for an inquiry by the Human Rights Watch into the accusations that police have routinely used pepper spray on migrants in Calais. "We don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past but we also want to handle the problems in Calais," Collomb said, as he wishes to avoid the ramifications the country faced after "the Jungle" in October caused international criticism over lack of human rights.</p>

<p>France and the EU has faced heavy criticism and changes over the past year. As the new president Macron took office, <a href="forum/2017/06/Mohamed-Arafa-vive-la-republique.php">he promised</a> [JURIST op-ed] to raise border security but sees the benefits of immigration and France helping those in need. In January Amnesty <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-eu-security-laws-targeting-muslims.php">criticized Europe</a> [JURIST report] for targeting Muslims and anti-immigration policies. In November the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-france-and-uk-failing-to-protect-rights-of-minors-in-calais-camp.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the governments of France and the UK were failing in their obligation to protect refugee children in the Calais Jungle refugee camp. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry on Friday <a href="http://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/spokesman/official_statement/-/asset_publisher/t2GCdmD8RNIr/content/id/2824435">ordered the US</a> [statement, in Russian] to reduce its number of diplomats in the country to 455 and evacuate two buildings used by the embassy.</p>

<p>The Ministry said the change is in response to pending <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364">US sanctions</a> [HR 3364 materials] against Russia, which US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/28/statement-press-secretary-russia-sanctions-legislation">said Friday</a> [press release] he intended to sign into law. It also said the US sanctions would violate the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/">UN Charter</a> [text], and that previous US expulsions of Russian diplomats violated the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> [text, PDF], saying both were politically motivated:<br />
<blockquote>The adoption of the new sanctions bill is an obvious indication that relations with Russia are in thrall to the political infighting in the United States. Moreover, the new bill sets to a goal to create a dishonest competitive advantage for the US in the global economy through the use of political means. This blackmail aimed at restricting Russia&#8217;s cooperation with its foreign partners threatens many countries and international businesses. <a href="http://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/spokesman/official_statement/-/asset_publisher/t2GCdmD8RNIr/content/id/2824435?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_t2GCdmD8RNIr&amp;_101_INSTANCE_t2GCdmD8RNIr_languageId=en_GB">[Ministry statement, in English]</a></blockquote>US lawmakers cited evidence of interference with US elections and human rights violations as justification for the sanctions and earlier expulsions.</p>

<p>The Ministry said the change makes the number of US diplomats in Russia match the number of Russian diplomats in the US and gave until September 1 for the reduction.</p>

<p>Both the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/house-of-representatives-overwhelmingly-pass-bill-for-sanctions-against-russia-iran-and-north-korea.php">House of Representatives</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/senate-passes-legislation-imposing-new-sanctions-on-russia.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] voted overwhelmingly in favor of the sanctions against Russia earlier this week. They follow, and in some cases give express congressional backing to, sanctions former US president Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/white-house-announces-sanctions-against-russia-for-election-hacking.php">made by executive order</a> [JURIST report] last year following a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">government report</a> [statement] finding Russia responsible for hacking the Democratic party servers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/">US Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] imposed <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0137.aspx">sanctions</a> [press release] against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Monday. The sanctions will freeze all of Maduro's assets that are subject to US jurisdiction and will prohibit any US citizens from doing business with him. As a de facto result of being sanctioned, Maduro will also be barred from accessing US financial and commercial systems. The sanctions came one day after Venezuela's <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-controversial-election-results-in-deadly-protests.php">controversial election</a>  [JURIST report] for a new assembly that would have the power to rewrite the country's constitution.  </p>

<p>Venezuela has faced significant political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. Last week Venezuela's opposition party <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike in response to the scheduled election. A non-binding <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier this month in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to open criminal impeachment proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] found former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio <a href="https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://archive.azcentral.com/persistent/icimages/news/arpaio%2520contempt%2520decision.pdf">guilty</a> [order, PDF] of criminal contempt on Monday. The court found Arpaio did not comply with a court order to stop detaining Latinos based solely on their immigration status. The matter was presented before Judge Susan Bolton, a senior federal judge with the District Court for the District of Arizona. Bolton found that Arpaio, "willfully violated the order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates' compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed." Counsel for Arpaio said that they believe a jury would have found in Arpaio's favor and said they intend to appeal the matter. </p>

<p>This is the second time Arpaio was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/arizona-sheriff-found-in-contempt-for-violating-court-order-on-racial-profiling.php">found in contempt</a> [JURIST report] for his and his officers' treatment of Latinos. In July 2015 the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and county officials in Phoenix <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/doj-settles-discrimination-case-against-arizona-sheriff.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] parts of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in 2012. The DOJ filed charges against the Sheriff's Office for discriminatory practices in traffic stops, work and home raids, and in county jails, as well as claims of retaliation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ninth-circuit-rules-arizona-county-police-engaged-in-racial-profiling.php">ruled</a> in April 2015 that Arpaio engaged in practices of racial profiling when conducting traffic stops, and in June 2015 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-judge-finds-against-arpaio-in-civil-rights-pre-trial-motion.php">issued</a> [JURIST reports] a pre-trial order accepting the other court's finding of racial profiling. In October 2014 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-orders-arizona-sheriff-to-undergo-racial-profiling-training.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Arpaio to undergo the same training as his deputies to assist in the prevention of racial profiling and unlawful detention in the Sheriff's Office as part of the ongoing case against Arpaio for racial profiling. In 2013 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-court-rules-arizona-sheriff-violated-latinos-constitutional-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Arpaio and his department engaged in unconstitutional racial profiling during the execution of immigration patrols.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/president-donald-j-trump-signs-hr-3364-law">signed</a> [press release] legislation imposing new sanctions against Russia and limiting the president's ability to ease existing sanctions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364">legislation</a> [HR 3364 materials] also imposes sanctions against North Korea and Iran.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-hr-3364">statement</a> [press release], Trump said that while he supports "tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior ... this legislation is significantly flawed."</p>

<p>A separate White House statement criticized the legislation for limiting the president's authority:<blockquote>Still, the bill remains seriously flawed&#8212;particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch&#8217;s authority to negotiate. Congress could not even negotiate a healthcare bill after seven years of talking. By limiting the Executive&#8217;s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together. The Framers of our Constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-countering-americas">White House press release</a></blockquote>Both the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/house-of-representatives-overwhelmingly-pass-bill-for-sanctions-against-russia-iran-and-north-korea.php">House of Representatives</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/senate-passes-legislation-imposing-new-sanctions-on-russia.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] voted overwhelmingly in favor of the sanctions last week. Moscow <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/russia-foreign-ministry-orders-diplomat-reduction-ahead-of-us-sanctions.php">responded</a> [JURIST report] over the weekend by ordering the US to reduce its number of diplomats in the country to 455 and evacuate two buildings used by the embassy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.jo/en">Jordanian parliament</a> [official website] on Tuesday narrowly voted to repeal <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/ar/jo/jo064ar.pdf">Article 308</a> [text, in Arabic] of the penal code, which permitted rapists to escape punishment if they married their victims. Rights groups applauded the decision, calling it a step forward in <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20170801114411-30zr8/?cid=social_20170801_73500947&adbid=892354364349661185&adbpl=tw&adbpr=295713773">ending violence against women</a> [Reuters report], especially in Middle Eastern countries where girls and women were offered as gifts to their rapists to avoid family shame. Though the Jordanian Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/jordan-repeals-law-opponents-said-pardoned-rape.php">voted to revoke</a> [JURIST report] the law in April, Parliament's upper body and King Abdullah II <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/jordan-parliament-urged-repeal-marry-rapist-clause-48962213">must also approve</a> [AP report] this action before the repeal can take effect. </p>

<p>Jordan is not the only Middle Eastern country to enforce "marry your rapist" laws. Criminal Codes of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Kuwait, Bahrain, Algeria, Tunisia and the Palestinian Territories <a href="/dateline/2017/05/Mais-Haddad-arab-world-laws-protect-the-rapist-not-the-victim.php">provide</a> [JURIST op-ed] that if the offender of rape lawfully marries the victim, any action becomes void and any investigation or other procedure is discontinued and, if a sentence has already been passed in respect of such action, then the sentence will be repealed. Activists and rights groups, such as <a href="https://www.equalitynow.org">Equality Now</a> [advocacy website], hope Tuesday's decision encourages Lebanon to revoke its similar law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/08/02/president-trump-introduces-raise-immigration-reform-act">announced his support</a> [press release] for a Senate bill to cut immigration levels over a decade. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Georgia Senator David Perdue <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=765">introduced</a> [press release] the <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/files/documents/170802_New_RAISE_Act_Bill_Text.pdf">Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act</a> [text, PDF] to "spur economic growth and raise working Americans' wages by giving priority to the best-skilled immigrants from around the world and reducing overall immigration by half." Cotton said that the bill's objective is to "create a skills-based system that is more responsive to the needs of our economy and preserves the quality of jobs available to American workers." </p>

<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump has made persistent efforts for immigration reform. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">agreed to review</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration's travel ban, partially lifting the temporary injunction that had blocked the ban's enforcement. The administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-appeals-travel-ban-to-supreme-court.php">sought review</a> [JURIST report] of decisions issued by the US Courts of Appeal for the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth</a> and <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuits</a> [official websites] in May. The Supreme Court's order permits execution of the travel ban, but it "may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States." The Supreme Court later clarified that <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/supreme-court-exempts-grandparents-from-enforcement-of-travel-ban.php">grandparents</a> [JURIST report] are exempted from the travel ban.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bangkok court acquitted two former prime ministers and two police officers of abuse of power on Wednesday. Former prime ministers Somchai Wongsawat and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh were <a href="http://time.com/4883586/thailand-abuse-power-acquitted/">accused</a> [AP report] of authorizing the police to use brutal force against an anti-government protest in 2008 when Somchai was prime minister and Chavalit was his deputy. More than 400 protesters were <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1298542/somchai-3-others-acquitted-in-yellow-shirt-dispersal-trial">injured</a> [Bangkok Post report], and two were killed. The court found that there was no conclusive evidence that police weapons caused the injuries and deaths. They also said that officials did not intend for the injuries and deaths to occur. Somchai and Chavalit could have served up to 10 years in prison if they had been found guilty. </p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand. In June Thailand's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/thailand-parliament-approve-legislation-giving-military-political-influence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation giving the military political influence. In April the king signed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/thailand-king-signed-new-constitution.php">military-backed constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law. In January Thailand's National Reform Steering Committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/thailand-considering-implementing-death-penalty-for-corruption-convictions.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a new law that Thai officials convicted of corruption involving more than 1 billion baht would be eligible for the death penalty. The Thailand Parliament unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/thailand-parliament-passes-controversial-cyber-crime-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a controversial amendment to its Computer Crime Act of 2007 (CCA) in December, which rights groups fear will give the government unrestricted power to police the web and suppress criticism. In September Amnesty International released a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-thailand-military-government-has-created-culture-of-torture.php">report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the prevalence of torture employed by Thai authorities and claiming the military government has led to a "culture of torture." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The parents of eight-year-old transgender student Nicole Brar brought a discrimination suit against Nicole's private school, <a href="http://www.heritageoak.org/">Heritage Oak Private School</a> [school website], located in Yorba Linda, California, and the school's parent company, <a href="https://www.nobellearning.com/">Nobel Learning Communities</a> [corporate website] Wednesday. The complaint, filed by the pro-bono organization <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/">Public Counsel</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/0910.pdf">alleges</a> [complaint, PDF] that the school made Nicole wear a boy's uniform, called her by the wrong name, prohibited her from using the girls' restroom, and did nothing to prevent her from being bullied by the other students, causing Nicole emotional distress. The complaint also says that California's <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=51">Unruh Civil Rights Act</a> [text] prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and that this act applies to private schools if they are for-profit. A spokesperson for Nobel Learning <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/03/lawsuit-parents-say-yorba-linda-private-school-insisted-transgender-daughter-wear-boys-uniform-use-staff-restroom/">said</a> [Orange County Register report] that Nicole's family rejected the accommodations that the school had proposed.  </p>

<p>Transgender rights have been an important topic in the US. In July the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/texas-senate-advances-bathroom-bill.php">advanced</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would require people to use the restroom corresponding to the gender listed on their birth certificates or drivers' licenses. Earlier in July New Jersey <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/nj-governor-christie-signs-bill-directing-school-boards-to-recognize-transgender-rights.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a law directing schools to recognize transgender rights. In March 11 states <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/states-withdraw-lawsuit-over-transgender-bathroom-executive-order-after-trump-repeals.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the US government after Obama's bathroom guidance was overturned. The bathroom guidance was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by the Trump administration in February. A Pennsylvania judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-federal-judge-rules-transgender-students-can-use-bathroom-of-choice.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in February that transgender students could use the bathroom of their choice. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.congreso.cl">Chilean Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.senado.cl/despachan-a-ley-despenalizacion-de-la-interrupcion-del-embarazo-en-tres/prontus_senado/2017-08-02/154028.html">passed a bill late Wednesday night</a> [press release, in Spanish] that would would allow abortions in instances of rape, threat to the mother's health, and fetal abnormality "incompatible with <correction num=1>life."</correction> The 70 to 45 vote was the result of a year-long struggle by pro-life Chilean senators. Currently, Chile is one of a few nations where abortion is illegal in all instances. The bill must now obtain approval from <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.cl">Chile's Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website, in Spanish] before going into effect. The Tribunal is expected to issue its ruling in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Female access to equitable health care services has been a contentious and evolving battle throughout the world, especially with regards to reproductive and sexual health. In June the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland must remedy harm done to a woman in 2010 after denying her an abortion. Under threat of President Trump's vow to overturn Roe v. Wade, the <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware legislature </a>[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. Last June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called on </a>[JURIST report] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health. The report refers to the "instrumentalization" of women in the healthcare system, in particular, the "subjection of women's natural biological functions to a politicized patriarchal agenda." Earlier that month independent experts for the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">found [</a>JURIST report] a woman faced "inhumane treatment" while seeking an abortion procedure in Northern Ireland. In the press release, the experts called upon countries to more effectively balance the rights of the fetus with the rights of the woman, viewing her as more than just a mechanism for child-bearing. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-elimination-of-female-genital-mutilation-by-2030.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all countries to eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://localtvwtkr.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/grimm1.pdf">remanded</a> [order, PDF] transgender student <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15&authored=&author=&filtered=&search=Gavin+Grimm">Gavin Grimm's case</a> [JURIST news archive] against the <a href="http://gloucester.schooldesk.net/SchoolBoard/SchoolBoardMembers/tabid/56473/Default.aspx">Gloucester County School Board</a> [official website] in order to determine whether the matter is now moot. Because Grimm graduated from <a href="ghs.gloucester.schooldesk.net/">Gloucester High School</a> [official website] on June 10, the Board is now arguing that there is no longer an "actual controversy," a requisite for all stages of judicial review, as the school's bathroom policy no longer applies to Grimm. The Fourth Circuit stated that they did not have enough factual information to hand down a ruling on the issue of mootness. The matter will now return to the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] where the court will examine the record and hear the arguments from both sides to determine whether Grimm may continue his suit. </p>

<p>Grimm, a high school student at a Gloucester County school who identifies as male, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">granted an order</a> [JURIST report] by the district court in June of 2016 allowing him to use the boys' restroom while the court considered the legal issues of the case. This order came after a decision by the federal court in April 2016, which reversed a lower court decision in holding Grimm's rights under <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX </a>[official website], which prohibits discrimination in schools, were violated by the school board refusing his use of the men's restroom. It was at that time the Gloucester County School Board first stated its intention to ask the US Supreme Court to review the Fourth Circuit decision. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-sends-transgender-bathroom-case-back-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> [JURIST article] the order and remanded Grimm's matter back to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of a move by the Trump administration to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">rescind guidelines</a> [JURIST report] that school districts should allow students to use the bathroom of their choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/6A43E282E3DC9FFE852581720053CBB5/$file/15-3078.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the murder conviction of a former Blackwater Worldwide security guard and ordered resentencing of three others for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/world/middleeast/03firefight.html">killing of unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007</a> [NYT report]. Nicholas Slatten, a former Army sniper, was found guilty of first-degree murder and <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/former-blackwater-guards-sentenced-for-killing-iraqi-civilians.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for firing the first fatal shots. The other three men, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty and Paul Slough, were found guilty of manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and use of a machine gun in a violent crime and sentenced to 30 years. The appeals court found that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing Slatten to be tried separately from his co-defendants and also found that the 30-year sentences violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment:<blockquote>We conclude the mandatory 30-year sentence imposed by <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Section 924(c)</a> [text] based solely on the type of weapons Slough, Heard and Liberty used during the Nisur Square shooting is grossly disproportionate to their culpability for using government-issued weapons in a war zone. We therefore also conclude these sentences violate the Eighth Amendment and remand for resentencing.</blockquote>It is unclear whether Slatten will be retried.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] and its employees have faced legal controversy in recent years for activities during the Iraq war. In 2014 the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-regulation-of-private-security-companies.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] stronger global and regulation of private security companies. The call came on the heels of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-jury-returns-guilty-verdict-for-blackwater-security-guards.php">guilty verdict</a> [JURIST report] against the four ex-Blackwater security guards. In 2012 Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/blackwater-agrees-to-settle-federal-criminal-charges.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] federal criminal charges dealing with export and firearm violations. Also in 2012 Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/blackwater-settles-last-lawsuit-in-2007-baghdad-shooting-incident.php">reached a confidential settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with survivors and families of victims in the 2007 shooting incident. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts expired and were not renewed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/attorney-general-sessions-director-national-intelligence-coats-hold-briefing-leaks">briefing</a> [press release, video] on Friday Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile] condemned the "staggering number of leaks" of "sensitive government information" and threatened to investigate and prosecute anyone who carries out such leaks in the future. Specifically, Sessions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-briefing-leaks-classified-materials">stated</a> [press release] that the DOJ "will not hesitate to bring lawful and appropriate criminal charges against those who abuse the nation's trust." In making this statement, Sessions made a reference to "reports in the media about conversations the President had with foreign leaders" on Thursday without disclosing the subject matter or the nature of said conversations. Stating that the "culture of leaking must stop," Sessions announced a series of measures being taken in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/ncsc-how-we-work/ncsc-nittf">National Insider Threat Task Force</a> [official website] to prevent further leaks. Among these measures were 1) new directions to Deputy Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/dag/staff-profile/meet-deputy-attorney-general">Rod Rosenstein</a> and the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/christopher-wray-sworn-in-as-fbi-director">new FBI Director Christopher Wray</a> [press release] to "oversee all classified leak investigations and actively monitor the progress of each and every case;" 2) prioritization of cases involving unauthorized disclosures; 3) increasing the resources devoted to "leak cases;" 4) creation of a counterintelligence unit to manage said cases; and 5) directing the DOJ to review policies that impact leak investigations. Sessions concluded: "We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited. They cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law abiding Americans."</p>

<p>Government information leaks have become an impending problem in the past several years and nations have struggled to curtail such leaks. In June, a panel consisting of three judges from the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-court-of-appeals-upholds-almost-all-convictions-of-former-cia-officer.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] all but one conviction of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/former-cia-officer-sentenced-to-42-months-in-prison-for-iran-leaks.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2015 for disclosing classified information to a journalist. The information was about national defense strategy in Iran. That decision is the latest in a long line of prosecutions for the prevention of national security leaks in the US. In August 2015 a former military contractor was <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/former-military-contractor-sentenced-for-stealing-classified-files.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for stealing classified files. Earlier the same year, General David Petraeus was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/david-petraeus-sentencing/">sentenced</a> [CNN report] to serve two years on probation and pay a $100,000 fine for leaking classified information to his biographer and lover Paula Broadwell. In August 2013 Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 35 years in prison for her disclosure of classified information to the anti-secrecy organization Wikileaks, and she has since been released. In June 2013 Edward Snowden, a former government employee and contractor, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with disclosing to newspaper reporters information about US intelligence activities that he obtained during the course of his work, raising significant <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the Espionage Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) joined forces with the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a>, the <a href="https://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> [advocacy websites], and <a href="https://jenner.com/">Jenner and Block, LLP</a> [official website] on Thursday in filing a <a href="/paperchase/Sorkhab%20v%20Tillerson.pdf">petition for mandamus and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief</a> [complaint, PDF] against the <a href="http://www.state.gov">US State Department</a> [official website] for refusing to process immigrant visa applications of the 2017 <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/diversity-visa">US Diversity Visa Program</a> [USCIS backgrounder] lottery winners coming from the six countries covered by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a>'s [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-new-immigration-executive-order.php">March travel ban</a> [JURIST report]. Stating that the complaint does not challenge the president's authority to impose the travel ban, the plaintiffs claim that  Trump's ban does not expressly prohibit visa issuance and further pointed out that visa issuance and entry are distinct matters under governing statutes. The complaint goes on to state that the:<blockquote>policy violates statutes and regulations requiring the issuance of immigrant visas to diversity visa lottery winners who are statutorily eligible, and it incorrectly conflates the Executive Order's ban on entry with a ban on visa issuance. ... The Executive Order does not (and could not) require that senseless result. The Order does not instruct the State Department to deny diversity immigrant visas, nor does it explain why denying diversity immigrant visas is necessary, or even helpful, to effectuate a temporary entry ban .... The State Department&#8217;s policy imposes irreparable harm on Plaintiffs in violation of consular officials&#8217; non-discretionary duty to issue visas to eligible applicants, without any justification.</blockquote>The case was filed with the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], and asks that the government process the applications of lottery winners by September 30, as required by statutes and regulations. Radad Furooz, one of the plaintiff's in the case <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/groups-file-federal-lawsuit-over-diversity-visa-denials">said</a> [ACLU report] that he "sold everything I had to get the chance to travel to the USA. I have nothing and nowhere to go now. The executive order travel ban has destroyed my dreams."</p>

<p>The travel ban has been a contentious topic since the Trump administration first implemented the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">executive order</a> [materials], and continues to face a series of federal legal action. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.hid.uscourts.gov/index.cfm?pid=0&mid=1">US District Court for the District of Hawaii</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-expands-travel-ban-exemptions.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the exemptions permitted under the Trump administration's temporary travel ban on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers-and-sisters-in-law. The federal government appealed that ruling to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/supreme-court-exempts-grandparents-from-enforcement-of-travel-ban.php">affirmed the district court's ruling</a>, thereby exempting grandparents and other relatives from the ban. In June, the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May, a federal district court in Washington <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a temporary restraining order to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Increasing violence in the Kasai provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has become more ethnic-based, according to a report <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21937&LangID=E">released</a> [press release] Friday by a team of UN human rights investigators. The UN team based their findings on the interviews of 96 people who have fled the violent region, confirming that over the course of three months around 251 people were victims with an alarming number of child killings. Violence in the region broke out in August 2016 with multiple ethnic groups forming militias against the government. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-independent-investigation-in-drcs-kasai-province.php"> called for</a> [JURIST report] the investigation in June, stated in the release of the report:<br />
<blockquote>Survivors have spoken of hearing the screams of people being burned alive, of seeing loved ones chased and cut down, of themselves fleeing in terror. Such bloodletting is all the more horrifying because we found indications that people are increasingly being targeted because of their ethnic group.Their accounts should serve as a grave warning to the Government of the DRC to act now to prevent such violence from tipping into wider ethnic cleansing...I call on the Government to take all necessary measures to fulfil its primary obligation to protect people from all ethnic backgrounds in the greater Kasai area.</blockquote>The High Commissioner also stressed the identification and prosecution of the militias responsible for the alleged ethnic violence.</p>

<p>Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, the leader of a militia in the DRC, <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/drc-militia-leader-turns-himself-in-to-un-authorities.php">turned himself in</a> [JURIST report] to UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo in July. In May the President of the DRC's electoral commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/congo-election-group-violence-may-delay-vote.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the presidential election may be postponed due to sectarian violence. In April a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-more-drc-refugees-migrating-to-angola-to-escape-violence.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that more than 11,000 refugees from the Kasai province had escaped to Angola due to violence in their province. The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/icc-violence-in-drc-could-be-war-crimes.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] in April alleging that recent acts of violence in the DRC could amount to war crimes. In March UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-human-rights-investigators-killed-in-the-drc.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the remains of two human rights investigators were found in the DRC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court rejected <a href="http://www.realalternatives.org/">Real Alternative Inc.'s</a> [advocacy website] argument that its religious beliefs should create a religious exemption and also that there was a substantial burden on the organization to follow the mandate.<blockquote>The fact that the Government may require insurers to offer coverage for expenditures for certain services that some might find objectionable on religious grounds cannot form the basis of requiring the Government to adjust its programs on behalf of all employees. The categories of services that could offend religious beliefs is wide-ranging and, as discussed infra, denying reimbursement for such services to all on the basis of the religious objections of some would be neither desirable nor administrable.</blockquote>The concurring and dissenting opinion agreed with the majority in its substantial burden analysis but did not come to the same conclusion in its religious beliefs analysis.</p>

<p>Female access to equitable health care services has been a contentious and evolving battle throughout the world, especially with regards to reproductive and sexual health. Earlier this month the Chilean Congress <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chiles-congress-relaxes-ban-on-abortion.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize pre-viability abortions, abortions in instances when the pregnancy resulted from a rape, and when the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother's health. In June the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland must remedy harm done to a woman in 2010 after denying her an abortion. Under threat of President Trump's vow to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. Last June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health. Earlier that month independent experts for the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">found</a> [JURIST report] a woman faced "inhumane treatment" while seeking an abortion procedure in Northern Ireland. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An inquiry conducted by the Myanmar government has found <a href="http://www.president-office.gov.mm/?q=briefing-room/news/2017/08/07/id-12376">no crimes against humanity</a> [press release, in Burmese] were committed during violent clashes in Rakhine state last year, Vice President Myint Swe said Sunday. Speaking to reporters at the release of the Rakhine Investigative Commission's final report, Swe <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/myanmar-crimes-humanity-rakhine-violence-49061959">denied allegations</a> [AP report] of ethnic cleansing and gang rapes. He did concede that some crimes may have occurred, but attributed them to individual members of security forces. The Myanmar government's commission has faced criticism from rights groups and international actors for a lack of transparency, and its credibility has been called into question.</p>

<p>The UN set up an independent commission to investigate the violence, but so far the Myanmar government has not allowed access to the area. A preliminary report in February found that Myanmar security forces' treatment of the Rohingya Muslims likely constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-myanmar-campaign-against-rohingya-likely-constitutes-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Interviews with Rohingya refugees reveal that security forces murdered children, pushed people into burning buildings and raped women, among <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/MM/FlashReport3Feb2017.pdf">other crimes</a> [report, PDF]. Last month Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar Yanghee Lee voiced her concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/un-rights-expert-voices-concern-over-worsening-situation-in-myanmar.php">worsening human rights situation</a> [JURIST report] in Myanmar. During her 12-day visit at the invitation of the Myanmar government, Lee stated she witnessed government security forces use humans as shields in violent encounters and numerous deaths of detainees while in custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor.html">Mayor Rahm Emanuel</a> [official website] and the City of Chicago <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2017/august/LawsuitTrumpJusticeDept.html">sued</a> [press release] the Trump administration Monday to stop the implementation of policies that would withhold federal funds from so-called "sanctuary cities." The <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2017/August/080717_Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] claims that the the new policies would require Chicago to choose between individuals' constitutional rights and funding for law enforcement. According to the complaint, the policies would enact two new requirements for Chicago and other sanctuary cities in order to receive funding,   <br />
<blockquote>(1) to detain its own residents and others at federal immigration officials' request, in order to give the federal government a 48-hour notice window prior to an arrestee's release; and (2) to give federal immigration officials unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities in order to interrogate any suspected noncitizen held there, effectively federalizing all of the City&#8217;s detention facilities.</blockquote> </p>

<p>The existence and functioning of sanctuary cities have come under fire since the first week of President Donald Trump's administration. From the beginning of the year, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities continue to <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In June, the California State Assembly passed two bills which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college by preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">entering a school site without a valid judicial warrant</a> [JURIST report] and approval from the superintendent. In May Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">banning sanctuary cities</a> [JURIST report] in the state. In March the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. In February the <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">Alabama House approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. In the same month, Texas Senate approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/texas-senate-approves-bill-targeting-sanctuary-cities.php">targeting sanctuary cities</a> [JURIST report] by requiring them to comply with federal immigration law. Earlier in February San Francisco similarly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding</a> [JURIST report] from sanctuary cities, including San Francisco.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13881985">Mauritania</a> [BBC country profile] conducted a referendum on Saturday to abolish the senate and to change the national flag. President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritania-politics-idUSKBN1AM0X5">applauded the vote</a> [Reuters report] and and said the move to abolish the governing body would improve governance by introducing more local forms of lawmaking. Opposition to the president's administration boycotted the vote and said that the referendum would give the president too much power, allowing him to extend the number of terms he is allowed to remain in office under the Mauritania constitution.    </p>

<p>Referendums are often used internationally to dramatically change state law or practices and this is the second Mauritania has seen in a little over 10 years. Aziz first <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/mauritania-military-stages-coup-and.php">came into office in 2008</a> [JURIST report] when a coup he backed removed then-President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. This was the second coup in which Aziz was involved, as in 2005 he backed a <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/military-junta-overthrows-mauritanian.php">additional coup</a> [JURIST report] that removed then-President Maaoya Sid'Ahmed Taya. Following the coup in 2005, Mauritania held a referendum to amend the state constitution to <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/mauritania-votes-in-constitutional.php">limit the number of terms</a> [JURIST report] that a president can serve.  <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.waed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Washington</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/salim-v-mitchell-memorandum-opinion-re-motions-summary-judgment">denied a motion for summary judgment</a> [opinion] filed by two psychologists who devised the torture techniques used on three former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prisoners, allowing the case to proceed to trial. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/aclu-sues-psychologists-over-cia-torture-program.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in 2015 against psychologists James Mitchell and John "Bruce" Jessen, who allegedly designed and persuaded the CIA to adopt their torture techniques as official practice of the CIA. In rejecting the both the plaintiffs' and defendants' motions for summary judgment, Judge Justin Quackenbush wrote, "[n]either side has demonstrated judgment as a matter of law is appropriate." The case is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/court-rejects-cia-torture-psychologists-final-bid-avoid-standing-trial-0">scheduled to go to trial</a> [ACLU press release] September 5.</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, the psychologists personally took part in many of the torture sessions and oversaw the entire program's implementation. The two surviving plaintiffs are Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a fisherman from Tanzania, and Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a refugee at his time of capture. The third plaintiff, Gul Rahman, died, allegedly as a result of the torture. The lawsuit was filed under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text] after the release of the so-called "<a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/sscistudy1.pdf">Senate Torture Report</a>" [text, PDF] in 2014, which found the so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed during the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">ineffective</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Tuesday reversed its position in a key voting rights <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-980-op-bel-6th-cir.pdf">case</a> [opinion, PDF] that will be before the Supreme Court later this year. The DOJ confirmed its support for an Ohio maintenance tactic used to remove people from the voting rolls by filing an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/briefs/2017/08/07/16-980_husted_v_randolph_institute_ac_merits.pdf">amicus curiae brief</a> [brief, PDF] with the Supreme Court. The Ohio practice involves sending people who have not voted in two years a confirmation notice and removing them from the voter rolls if they fail to respond and do not vote for an additional four years. Previously the DOJ supported the challenge to Ohio's voter purging tactic, but now believes that it is in compliance with the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr2/text">1993 National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA) and the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hr3295/text">2002 Help America Vote Act</a> [materials]. The DOJ ultimately came to the conclusion that abstaining from voting is sufficient grounds for the state to send out a confirmation notice.</p>

<p>Voting rights, on both the national and state level, have been an issue in the US for decades and voting issues have gone to court in many states in just the past year. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-ohio-voter-purge-case.php">agreed to hear</a> [JURIST report] this Ohio voting rights case. Earlier in May the Maine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/maine-supreme-court-finds-state-ranked-candidate-voting-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's newly enacted legislation providing for a ranked-choice voting system conflicted with the state's constitution. In March seven convicted felons filed <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-ex-felons-file-class-action-suit-over-voting-rights-laws.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging Florida's process of restoring voting rights to felons is unconstitutionally arbitrary. Earlier that month a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-texas-guilty-of-illegally-drawing-voting-districts.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the boundaries of three voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Also in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://cpj.org/awards/2017/pravit-rojanaphruk-thailand.php">Pravit Rojanaphruk</a>  [CPJ profile], a prominent Thai journalist, was charged Tuesday with sedition and violation of Thailand's computer laws for making political posts online. Pravit, known for being a strong advocate of press freedom, allegedly made political posts on Facebook in February 2016, prompting the current <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/08/world/asia/ap-as-thailand-political-dissent.html">charges</a>  [NYT report]. Poomsuk Poomsukcharoen, a member of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiQw6_rrsjVAhVCMGMKHUpkDg0QFgg_MAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftlhr2014.wordpress.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNFtaD9yyjkFF81rS-G9SY2GY60PwA">Thai Lawyers for Human Rights</a>  [advoacy website, in Thai], stated that Pravit presented himself to the police department after the charges were filed. Poomsuk also stated that Pravit was asked to return to police station on August 18, where he will be provided with more information concerning his charges. If convicted, Pravit could face up to seven years in prison. </p>

<p>Thailand's enforcement of laws stifling free speech has become increasingly prevalent the past year. In July Thailand's Supreme Court sentenced opposition leader Jatuporn Prompan to one year in prison for defaming Thailand's current prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. In May Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thailand-orders-facebook-to-remove-posts-about-king.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Facebook to remove posts about the king. That same month a Thai human rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thailand-human-rights-lawyer-charged-for-insulting-royal-family.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] for insulting the royal family. In February the Supreme Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/thailand-court-upholds-magazine-editors-royal-insult-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the sentence of a former magazine editor who published stories criticizing the royal family. Earlier in February human rights groups urged the Thai Army to drop <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-groups-urge-thailand-officials-to-drop-charges-against-3-activists.php">defamation charges</a> [JURIST report] against three activists. Prior to that, UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-not-to-stifle-free-speech.php">called on</a>[JURIST report] Thai authorities to cease using royal defamation laws to counter free speech that is critical of the royal family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a>  [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3EDC3D4817D618CF8525817600508EF4/$file/15-1328-1687707.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] an Obama-era rule that banned certain gases from being used in air conditioning and refrigeration appliances. The court ruled that the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] cannot ban these chemicals under a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act">Clean Air Act</a>  [materials] provision, Section 612(c), because it was only meant to prevent the depletion of ozone as these chemicals have not been proven to be hazardous to the earth's ozone layer.</p>

<p>Many environmental other groups have expressed serious concerns over Scott Pruitt's appointment as the new head of the EPA. In April <a href="http://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/environmental-groups-ask-appeals-court-to-order-epa-pesticide-ban.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] that asked the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to order the EPA to ban a widely used pesticide after Pruitt denied a petition to prohibit its use. In February Pruitt <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/epa-chief-promises-aggressive-rollback-of-obama-regulations.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] to cut back EPA regulations, saying the agency's Clean Power Plan, Waters of the US rule, and the US Methane rule will all be targets under the Trump administration. Pruitt's nomination for head of the EPA was met with consternation from Democrats, who cited Pruitt's numerous lawsuits against the EPA while he was the Oklahoma Attorney General. Days before his confirmation by the Senate, Pruitt was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/oklahoma-judge-orders-epa-head-to-release-e-mails.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge to release thousands of emails between the Oklahoma AG office and various fossil fuel companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Venezuela Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the arrest and removal of the mayor of Chacao, Ramon Muchacho. Muchacho was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he refused to take down barricades set up during anti-government demonstrations. President Nicolás Maduro continued his efforts to shut down opposition to the government when the new constitutional assembly composed solely of pro-government delegates convened on Tuesday as well. Opposition delegates were not allowed to enter the building while the pro-government assembly convened to pass decrees in support of Maduro. Coinciding with these developments, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Office</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21948&LangID=E">short report</a> [press release] condemning the Venezuelan government's use of force to stifle opposition to the government. The UN investigation revealed instances of security forces using tear gas on protestors, deaths among protestors, and over five-thousand detentions. The full report of the UN's findings is set to be released later in August.</p>

<p>Venezuela has been going through significant political unrest between the government and anti-government opposition recently. In July violent protests <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-controversial-election-results-in-deadly-protests.php">erupted</a> [JURIST report] after a controversial election for a new assembly that would have the power to rewrite the nation's constitution. Earlier in July Venezuela's opposition party <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike to be held in response to the scheduled election. A non-binding <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier in July in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">open criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five unnamed transgender military servicemembers filed a <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AS-FILED-COMPLAINT_Doe.v.Trump_-1.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] and various officials in his administration on Wednesday, claiming the president's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890193981585444864">declaration on Twitter</a> [text, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890196164313833472">part 2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890197095151546369">part 3</a>] that transgender individuals would no longer be accepted or allowed to serve in the military violated the Due Process and Equal Protection components of the Fifth Amendment of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/constitution">US Constitution</a> [text]. The five servicemembers, identified as Jane Does 1 through 5, are represented by lawyers from the <a href="https://www.glad.org/">GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders</a> (GLAD) and the <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a> (NCLR) [advocacy websites]. One complainant served in the <a href="https://www.gocoastguard.com/">US Coast Guard</a>, another served in the <a href="https://www.nationalguard.com/">National Guard</a>, and two others served in the <a href="https://www.army.mil/">Army</a> [government websites], according to the complaint. The fifth was merely identified as a person whose "livelihood depends on her military service." The complaint notes that Trump's "proposed policy" to ban transgender individuals from serving was met by widespread criticism, including "fifty-six former generals and admirals [who] issued a public statement denouncing the new policy." The complaint also contends that the White House "outlined a plan to end the active service of transgender servicemembers to be transmitted to the Department of Defense for implementation."<blockquote>These servicemembers, like many others, have built their lives around their military service. On July 26, 2017, President Trump announced in a series of tweets that he would reverse the Department of Defense's policy on transgender servicemembers, stating that "the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military." The President's announcement, which upon information and belief was made without consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff, upset the reasonable expectations of Plaintiffs and thousands of other transgender servicemembers and the men and women with whom they serve and fight. Upon information and belief, the White House turned that decision into official guidance, approved by the White House counsel&#8217;s office, to be communicated to the Department of Defense.</blockquote>The plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against the implementation of the proposed ban, among other forms of relief. The previous ban against transgender individuals serving in the US military <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ban-on-transgender-service-members-lifted.php">was lifted</a> [JURIST report] last July. </p>

<p>The transgender community has faced significant legal challenges in recent years. In January Democrats in the California State Senate <a href="/2017/01/proposed-california-bill-would-add-third-gender-option-to-state-documents.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make California the first state to include three gender options on state identification documents: male, female and non-binary. In June of last year a judge from Multnomah County Circuit Court in Oregon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/oregon-court-recognizes-non-binary-as-a-legal-gender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an individual's gender could be legally changed from female to non-binary. In the same month a US magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-transgender-inmate-must-be-given-access-to-female-items.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order requiring California prions to provide transgender inmates who identify as female access to female-oriented items to which inmates have access in women's correctional facilities. Last January a Georgia appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/court-of-appeals-of-georgia-overturns-denial-of-transgender-name-changes.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the denial of transgender name changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly (ANC) <a href="http://minci.gob.ve/2017/08/aprobada-ley-comision-verdad-justicia-paz/">created</a> [press release, in Spanish] a Commission for Truth, Justice and Public Legitimacy on Tuesday. The ANC is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/venezuela-assembly-s-truth-commission-ready-to-hound-opponents">tasked</a> [Bloomberg report] with rewriting Venezuela's constitution. The ANC has previously passed a decree which declared that the national assembly and the supreme court could over rule the assembly. The commission will remove the legal immunity of the national assembly members. The national assembly has previously opposed Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro. Critics of the commission have claimed that the commission will be used to silence opposition to Maduro. The commission will be able to strip the public duties from those that are found to have acted against Venezuela. The creation of the commission comes after multiple mayors who have opposed Maduro have been sentenced to prison for failing to clear roadway blockades.</p>

<p>Venezuela has experienced a significant amount of political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. In July Venezuelans voted to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">reject</a> [JURIST report] a plan to rewrite the country's constitution in a non-binding referendum. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge in Louisiana <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-laed-2_16-cv-15639/pdf/USCOURTS-laed-2_16-cv-15639-1.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] against the state on Tuesday in a constitutional challenge to a <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=960516">law</a> [text] that requires naturalized citizens who were born outside the US to present a valid birth certificate from their home country before they can obtain a marriage license. In his ruling, Judge Ivan Lemelle from the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [officialwebsite] granted a permanent injunction against the implementation of Act 436, a Louisiana law that <a href="https://legiscan.com/LA/votes/HB836/2015">easily passed both houses of state government</a> [vote count] and became law in 2015. The plaintiff in the lawsuit, who immigrated to the US with his parents when he was three months old, did not have a birth certificate because he was born in an Indonesian refugee camp, according to the ruling. He was denied a marriage license under Act 436, which "requires that all applicants for a marriage license provide a certified birth certificate, a valid and unexpired passport, or an unexpired visa accompanied by a Form I-94," documents he could not obtain on account of the circumstances of his birth. The judge denied the state's argument that a permanent injunction would be a disservice to the public interest. <blockquote>In the instant matter the permanent injunction protects the fundamental right to marriage and the right to be free from unconstitutional discriminatory classifications based on national origin. Consequently, this factor also weighs in favor of Plaintiff and his motion for a permanent injunction is deemed appropriate.</blockquote>Because the challenge to the law was a facial challenge, the ruling permanently enjoins and restrains future implementation of Act 436. A preliminary injunction against implementation of the law <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-blocks-louisiana-marriage-law.php">had been granted</a> [JURIST report] by the same federal court in March. </p>

<p>The focus on immigration policies continues to be a growing legal issue. In April US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/doj-orders-increased-criminal-immigration-enforcement.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] his office has mandated immigration enforcement as a priority. JURIST Guest Columnist Ali Khan <a href="/forum/2017/04/deportation-as-a-crime-against-humanity.php">discussed</a> [JURIST backgrounder] the potential deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US as a crime against humanity. Also in April, A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesman <a href="/2017/04/dhs-ends-plan-to-separate-women-and-children-at-us-border.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that President Donald Trump's administration was no longer planning to separate women and children at the US' southern border as a means of deterring immigration. That same month, the state of Massachusetts  <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/massachusetts-challenges-states-role-in-immigration-detention.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court find that state authorities lack jurisdiction to detain illegal immigrants. A day earlier, the California State Senate overwhelmingly passed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/california-passes-bill-to-prohibit-state-police-from-enforcing-immigration-laws.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] on last Monday that would expand protections for undocumented immigrants by prohibiting state or local law enforcement from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Texas House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/851/billtext/pdf/HB00214E.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would prohibit health insurance plans from providing coverage for elective abortions. An elective abortion is defined as one in which the mother is not in danger of death or serious injury if the abortion is not performed. Insurance for an elective abortion would only be allowed if the coverage is provided separately from the other health plan coverage and the enrollee pays a premium for the coverage separately from the other health plan premium. The health insurer is not allowed to decrease the elective abortion premium by taking into account any cost savings from the other health plan that would result from having the elective abortion insurance. The insurer also cannot discount or reduce the premium of the other health plan for enrolling in the elective abortion premium.  The bill was <a href="http://www.journals.house.state.tx.us/hjrnl/851/pdf/85C1DAY16FINAL.PDF#page=30">passed</a> [vote record, PDF] by a vote of 92-46. Proponents of the bill have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-abortion-idUSKBN1AP2FQ">stated</a> [Reuters report] that it prevents opponents of abortion from subsidizing abortion. Similar bills have been passed in 10 other states. Opponents of the bill have called the bill a requirement to purchase "rape insurance" due to the bill having no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.</p>

<p>Abortion has been a hotly debated political topic in the United States for many years. In July abortion rights groups filed a lawsuit in Texas over a law that banned a common method of second-trimester abortions. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-san-francisco-law-on-deceptive-advertising-from-anti-abortion-clinics-.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an anti-abortion health clinic's argument that a San Francisco ordinance violated their First Amendment right to free speech. Also in June in the state of Ohio lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-senate-votes-to-ban-common-method-for-second-trimester-abortions.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 24-9 in favor of a bill that would criminalize a common second trimester abortion procedure. Earlier that month the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">barred doctors</a> [JURIST report] from suing state over abortion law, holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Sanctuary_Cities_Austin_ruling_(002).pdf?cachebuster:36">dismissed</a> [order, PDF] a case concerning <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004I.pdf#navpanes=0">Senate Bill 4</a> [text, PDF], a bill intended to penalize so-called "sanctuary cities." The action was filled by the state of Texas seeking to have SB 4 declared constitutional before the bill was scheduled to take effect. The law would require local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and prohibit local agencies from enforcing policies that bar officers from inquiring as to an individual's immigration status. The court found that there was no "justiciable injury" to Texas as there was not yet a challenge to the bill's constitutionality. Without a requisite injury, the court held that it must dismiss the matter as moot. </p>

<p>The existence and functioning of sanctuary cities have come under fire since the first week of President Donald Trump's administration. From the beginning of the year, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities continue to <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In June the California State Assembly passed two bills which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college by preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from entering a school site without a valid <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">judicial warrant</a> [JURIST report] and approval from the superintendent. In May Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law the bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">banning sanctuary cities</a> [JURIST report] in the state. In March the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. In February the <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">Alabama House approved </a>[JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. In the same month, Texas Senate approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/texas-senate-approves-bill-targeting-sanctuary-cities.php">targeting sanctuary cities</a> [JURIST report] by requiring them to comply with federal immigration law. Earlier in February San Francisco similarly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding </a>[JURIST report] from sanctuary cities, including San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/5C57343011F6D06585258177005292C9/$file/17-1156.pdf">ruled</a> Wednesday [opinion, PDF] that <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/silliman/">Judge Scott Silliman</a> [official profile] should have recused himself in a case concerning multiple defendants who were charged with aiding in the 9/11 attacks. The petitioner, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/03/world/meast/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-fast-facts/index.html">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [CNN profile], argued that Silliman was biased in the matter and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-guantanamo-trial/index.html">cited</a> [CNN report] a 2010 comment in which Silliman called Mohammad and his co-defendants the major conspirators in the 9/11 attacks. The court found that because Silliman "expressed an opinion that Petitioner is guilty of the very crimes of which he is accused," he manifested an "apparent bias" and thus should have recused himself. The court granted the petition asking the court to recuse Silliman and vacated a <a href="http://www.mc.mil/Portals/0/pdfs/KSM17-002/USCMCR%20KSM%2017-002%20Merits%20Decision%20(June%2029%202017).pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/Cases.aspx?caseType=cmcr">United States Court of Military Commission</a> [official website] to reinstate charges for attacking civilians and destroying property in violation of the law of war against Mohammad and his co-defendants.</p>

<p>Mohammed allegedly met Osama bin Laden sometime in 1996. Following the 9/11 attacks, he was placed on the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists">FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list</a> [website] in October of 2001. One year later, Mohammed was linked to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19881138">Bali nightclub bombing</a> [BBC report] in <correction num=1>2002</correction>. He was captured in Pakistan along with other al Qaeda operatives in 2003. In 2006 the US government acknowledged that Mohammad was being held in <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15&authored=&author=&filtered=&search=Guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] with other suspected terrorists. In February 2008 the US announced that it would be seeking the death penalty against Mohammed and his co-defendants. In January 2009 then-president Barack Obama ordered a halt to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/21/barack-obama-guantanamo-bay-tribunals">Guantanamo Bay</a> [Guardian report] tribunals, delaying Mohammed's trail by 120 days. In April 2011, following more delays, the Department of Justice announced they would refer the case against Mohammed <correction num=2><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/statement-attorney-general-prosecution-911-conspirators">back to the Department of Defense</a></correction> [press release]. The matter of Mohammed and his co-defendants is still pending today. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Washington Supreme Court upholds Seattle gun tax</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/SupremeCourt/?fa=supremecourt.welcome">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] upheld Seattle's <a href="http://clerk.seattle.gov/~archives/Ordinances/Ord_124833.pdf">tax</a> [ordinance, PDF] on guns and ammunition sales on Thursday. The two individual gun owners and organizations bringing the suit <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/937231.pdf">argued</a> [opinion, PDF] that the tax was actually a state regulation on guns, which is prohibited by a <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290">Washington state law</a> [official website].  The <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/index.cfm?fa=opinions.showOpinion&filename=937231MAJ">six-justice majority</a> [materials] affirmed the lower court's decision in favor of the city. The majority opinion said, "While courts should be dubious of regulations masquerading as taxes (and vice versa), in this case Watson [the plaintiff] offers no convincing evidence that the Ordinance has a regulatory purpose or intent." The court also cited the fact that the revenue from the sale of guns was used for public services as evidence that the ordinance was a tax. The dissenting justice argued that since Seattle passed an ordinance that relates to firearms, it is invalid, because the state law prohibits the city from doing exactly that.  </p>

<p>Gun control remains a controversial domestic issue. In July a federal judge <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-issues-preliminary-injunction-against-controversial-california-gun-ban.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against California's controversial gun ban. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/iowa-governor-signs-law-expanding-gun-rights.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] in April expanding gun rights in the state. South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard in March vetoed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/south-dakota-governor-vetoes-bills-seeking-to-loosen-gun-control-laws.php">a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that would have loosened the state's regulations on concealed carry laws. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-house-approves-bill-making-it-easier-for-mentally-incompetent-veterans-to-purchase-guns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in March making it easier for certain veterans to obtain firearms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/27/927ffc64-40c7-5965-a82f-34deba243ea6/598c7e5689cf3.pdf.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] against a state <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/876573">cigarette tax</a> [text] on Thursday. The plaintiffs&#8212;cigarette companies, distributors, and smokers&#8212;argued that the $1.50 tax violated the state constitution. The majority agreed, saying that since the tax was a revenue bill, it must originate in the House, be passed at least five days before the legislative session ended, and be approved by either the public or 75 percent of each house. In this case, the Senate created the tax and approved it on the last day of the session. The bill also did not gain 75 percent of the vote, rendering it unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>Cigarettes continue to be a serious health and legal issue around the world.  Last month Philip Morris was ordered to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/phillip-morris-ordered-to-pay-legal-fees-to-australia-government.php">to pay</a> [JURIST report] legal fees to the Australian government. In May 2016 the EU Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/eu-top-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-rules.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] EU rules that will require health warnings to cover 65 percent of a cigarette pack. In June 2015 a judge for the Quebec Superior Court awarded <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/canada-court-orders-tobacco-companies-to-pay-billions-in-damages.php">over $15 billion</a> [JURIST report] in damages to Quebec smokers in a case against tobacco companies JTI-Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, making this the largest award for damages and the biggest class action lawsuit in Canada's history. In May 2014 the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-suits-against-tobacco-companies.php">dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a consolidated lawsuit brought against various tobacco companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website], a protest in opposition of the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta for a second five-year term has resulted in at least 24 people dead on Saturday. Kenya police used live ammunition and tear gas against citizens and opposition officials in order to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/kenyan-protests-against-kenyatta-election-victory-turn-deadly">quell the protest</a> [Guardian report], which they say was a guise to rob and destroy property. Those opposing the reelection have justified their protest, declaring that the election was rigged and opposition leader Raila Odinga was the actual winner. The ballots, however, were recounted and the Elections Observation Group, Kenya's main poll monitoring organization, stated it found no evidence of manipulation. Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] officials are <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/08/kenya-investigate-police-killings-of-pro-opposition-protesters/"> still requesting</a> [press release] Kenyan authorities to investigate the use of force by police during these protests, attesting that &#8220;everyone has a right to peaceful protest and they must not be hurt, injured or killed for exercising that right.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is not the first time Kenya has been plagued with the accusations of election rigging as well as accusations of police abusing citizens' rights. In 2007, Raila Odinga claimed an election was rigged resulting in rioting and police brutality thereby causing the killing of 1,200 people.  In January current President Kenyatta <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/kenya-president-uhuru-kenyatta-approves-voting-law-despite-fears-of-election-rigging.php">signed a controversial law</a> [JURIST report], prior to this election, that enables paper recount of votes if the electronic systems fail. Also, in March a rights group <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-kenya-police-investigative-practices.php">urged investigation</a> [JURIST report]  into the practices and surveillance techniques of police officers after releasing a report documenting the serious human rights abuses that have allegedly resulted. In February a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-kenya-to-cease-crackdowns-on-rights-groups.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Kenya to stop crackdowns on human rights group to protect the integrity of this upcoming election. In November a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-experts-condemn-kenya-violence-against-protesters-and-journalists.php">condemned reported violence</a> [JURIST report] against anti-corruption protesters and journalists in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Last year the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">withdrew charges</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta, who was accused of crimes against humanity for post-election violence, but indicated it would renew the charges if presented with enough evidence</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illinois <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official website] signed <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/100/SB/PDF/10000SB0189lv.pdf">SB 189</a> [text, PDF] on Friday removing the statutes of limitations on certain sexual abuse crimes. The legislation amends chapter 38, sections 3-6, of the Illinois Criminal Code to eliminate a time guard for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/illinois/articles/2017-08-12/rauner-signs-law-removing-sex-crime-statutes-of-limitation">reporting</a> [AP report] felony sex crimes and sex crimes against children. Under the previous code a victim of these sex crimes had to report the crime within 20 years of reaching age 18. The statute now reads:</p>

<blockquote>When the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the offense, a prosecution for criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, or felony criminal sexual abuse may be commenced at any time <strike>when corroborating physical evidence is available or an individual who is required to report an alleged or suspected commission of any of these offenses under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act fails to do so.</strike></blockquote>

<p>The stricken language above expands the time period and circumstances under which a prosecution for sex crimes can commence. Some of the crimes covered by the bill include child pornography, solicitation for a juvenile prostitute, promoting juvenile prostitution, criminal sexual assault, and sexual conduct toward minors. The legislation takes immediate effect. </p>

<p>Rape and other sex crimes are frequent issues in the international legal community and have made headlines in the past several months. In June, Japan's lower legislative house <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/japan-lawmakers-approve-changes-to-century-old-rape-law.php">approved changes</a> [JURIST report] to Japan's century-old rape laws that would expand the definition of rape, lengthen prison sentences to five years and allow prosecutions to occur in instances where a victim did not press charges. In May Australia <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/australia-to-ban-pedophiles-from-traveling-overseas.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to decrease child sex trafficking by prohibiting registered sex offenders from traveling overseas. The same day, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-in-statutory-rape-deportation-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the federal age of consent was 16. Earlier the same month, the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">India Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/india-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-gang-rape-case.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty in the case of a gang rape which led to the victim's death. In July 2016, the German parliament unanimously passed a law expanding the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/germany-adopts-law-expanding-the-definition-of-sex-crimes.php">definition of sex crimes</a> [JURIST report], making any form of "nonsensical sexual contact" a crime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] signed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s114/BILLS-115s114enr.pdf">VA Choice and Quality Employment Act</a> [text, PDF] on Saturday that will allocate $2.1 billion in government funds to the Veterans Choice Fund, and an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-veterans-medical-20170812-story.html">additional $1.8 billion</a> [LA Times report] to core VA health programs and medical facility leases. Trump signed the bill in response to the budget shortfall in the <a href="https://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official website], which threatened healthcare for thousands of veterans. Additionally, the bill also addresses staff shortages in veterans health administration, lack of proper training and experience in the administration and delivery of healthcare, accountability of political appointees placed in charge of managing the VA, hiring of VA medical center directors, competitive salary packages of physician assistants, re-employment of former VA employees, promotional opportunities for VA technical experts, and employment of students and recent graduates, among other things. While veterans groups welcomed the bill, they also criticized the delay stating: "Unfortunately, this bill took far too long to get to the president&#8217;s desk and is $1.8 billion more expensive than it needed to be." The bill was approved unanimously by both houses of <a href="http://www.congress.gov">Congress</a> [official website] before it was presented to the president.</p>

<p>The VA has been heavily criticized for its inability to provide adequate medical care to veterans, despite efforts from the Obama administration to improve the claim review process. In March 2015, former president <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/obama-to-announce-committee-to-improve-va.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the creation of a new advisory committee to improve conditions in the VA. The committee was to consist of business leaders, members of veteran organizations and health science professionals with a diverse range of experience. In February 2015, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/obama-signs-suicide-prevention-for-veterans-act-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5059/text">Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act</a> [text, PDF] into law in order to combat increasing suicide rates among American veterans suffering form PTSD. The act was passed by a unanimous Congress and is intended to facilitate veterans' access to mental health resources, as studies have shown that suicide rates are higher among those who do not receive any type of mental health care. In August 2014, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/obama-signs-bill-overhauling-veterans-affairs-department.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Department of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4031/text">Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act</a> [text, PDF] to allow veterans to seek private care outside of VA facilities and provide money for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] on Saturday announced a federal civil rights investigation into the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. A "Unite the Right" rally turned deadly when counter-protesters clashed with members of white nationalist groups and 20-year old James Alex Fields drove a car into a crowd, killing 32-year old Heather Heyer and injuring others. Sessions condemned the violence and announced a federal probe:<blockquote>The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated. I have talked with FBI Director Chris Wray, FBI agents on the scene, and law enforcement officials for the state of Virginia. The FBI has been supporting state and local authorities throughout the day. U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has commenced a federal investigation and will have the full support of the Department of Justice. Justice will prevail.</blockquote>Mountcastle issued a separate <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/joint-statement-united-states-attorney-s-office-western-district-virginia-federal">statement</a> [press release] in conjunction with the FBI and DOJ&#8217;s Civil Rights Division: "The Richmond FBI Field Office, the Civil Rights Division, and the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of Virginia have opened a civil rights investigation into the circumstances of the deadly vehicular incident that occurred earlier Saturday morning. The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner."</p>

<p>The "Unite the Right" rally took place Saturday to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the recently renamed Emancipation Park. The rally drew members of white nationalist groups who marched through the streets of Charlottesville Friday night carrying torches and chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. Counter-protesters clashed with these groups Saturday, and 34 were injured. In addition, two state troopers were killed Saturday when the helicopter they were using to monitor the protests crashed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21972&LangID=E">called on Kenyan leaders</a> [press release] Tuesday to "take the responsible path and exercise their leadership to avoid violence" in the wake of last week's contentious election. <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-protest-of-president-reelection-results-in-death-of-citizens.php">Deadly protests erupted</a> [JURIST report] over the weekend after incumbent candidate Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner Friday. Opposition candidate Raila Odinga has claimed widespread voter fraud. Zeid expressed concern over reports of police brutality and the use of live ammunition against protesters:<blockquote>People have the right to assemble and protest peacefully, and the authorities have a responsibility to ensure they can do so. The Government also has a responsibility to ensure that security forces prioritize dialogue, non-violent means and exercise restraint, using proportionate force only when unavoidable. ... Protesters should never resort to violence and political leaders should send clear messages to their supporters urging peaceful conduct. All acts of violence, including the serious allegations of excessive use of force by security forces, must be promptly and independently investigated.</blockquote>Zeid urged Kenya's leaders to "do their utmost to calm a volatile political climate."</p>

<p>Protests following Kenya's 2007 election resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, triggering an International Criminal Court investigation and charges that were <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">ultimately dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta. In March a rights group <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-kenya-police-investigative-practices.php">urged investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the practices and surveillance techniques of Kenyan police officers after releasing a report documenting serious human rights abuses. In February a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-kenya-to-cease-crackdowns-on-rights-groups.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Kenya to stop crackdowns on human rights group to protect the integrity of the upcoming election. In November a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-experts-condemn-kenya-violence-against-protesters-and-journalists.php">condemned reported violence</a> [JURIST report] against anti-corruption protesters and journalists in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/EN/Homepage/home_node.html">German constitutional court</a> (ECB) [official website] <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2017/07/rs20170718_2bvr085915.html">sent</a> [order, in German] a case concerning the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-court-idUSKCN1AV0PN">attempt to buy $2.7 trillion dollar's worth of bonds</a> [Reuters report] to the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] on Tuesday. The Publice Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) of the ECB <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-refers-qe-challenge-to-eu-court-2017-08-15">started in March 2015</a> [MarketWatch report] in order to bolster the Euro. Unlike similar programs put in place by the ECB, the PSPP enables the bank to buys bonds across the eurozone, a move which the constitutional court noted may violated German monetary financing laws. In a <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2017/bvg17-070.html;jsessionid=3779C3D1560FBB5F3DFA289F782C5E6F.1_cid394">press release</a> [text] the court stated: <blockquote>The primary law of the Union provides but little guidance on the decision-making of the ECB Governing Council concerning the manner and scope of risk sharing between the members of the European System of Central Banks. Consequently, the ECB Governing Council may be able to modify the rules on risk sharing within the Eurosystem in a way that would result in risks for the profit and loss accounts of the national central banks and also threaten the overall budgetary responsibility of national parliaments.</blockquote>The court has asked the ECJ for expedited proceedings in order to more quickly issue its ruling at the request of the German government.</p>

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing struggle to establish financial stability in the EU. In June 2016 the German constitutional court ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/germany-court-upholds-ecb-bond-buying-program.php">ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction program</a> [JURIST report] complied with German law. In January 2015 EU Advocate General Cruz Villalon gave <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/eu-legal-advisor-supports-ecbs-bond-purchase-plan.php">legal support</a> [JURIST report] to the ECB program as an attempt to remedy the financial crisis in the Eurozone. In September 2014 the EU Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-parliament-approves-new-bank-supervisory-mechanism.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new bank supervisory mechanism. Last November the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports]. That June the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-proposes-regulations-to-address-future-financial-crises.php">European Commission announced</a> [JURIST report] a proposal that would address the problems of bailing out large banks with public funds during financial crises in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Thai provincial court in the north eastern province of Khon Kaen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/15/world/asia/ap-as-thailand-political-dissent.html?_r=0">sentenced</a> [NYT report] activist <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/ongoing-detention-jatupat-boonpattararaksa">Jatupat "Pai Dao Din" Boonpattararaksa</a> [FrontlineDefenders profile] to two-and-a-half years in prison for sharing a BBC article about Thailand's <a href="http://www.thaiembassy.org/amman/en/information">King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun</a> [official profile] on Facebook on Tuesday. The article concerned personal details concerning Maha's life as the crown prince, including information from three past marriages that ended in divorce. Poonsuk plead guilty to the charge after his counsel recommended he do so in light of the court's repeated denials of bail. Had Poonsuk not plead guilty, commentators stated he likely would have been sentenced to five years in prison. </p>

<p>Thailand's enforcement of lese majeste laws and stifling of free speech has become increasingly prevalent in the past few years. In February the Supreme Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/thailand-court-upholds-magazine-editors-royal-insult-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the sentence of a former magazine editor who published stories criticizing the royal family under the lese majeste laws. Earlier in February human rights groups urged the Thai Army to drop <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-groups-urge-thailand-officials-to-drop-charges-against-3-activists.php"> defamation charges </a> [JURIST report] against three activists. Prior to that, UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-not-to-stifle-free-speech.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Thai authorities Tuesday to cease using royal defamation laws to counter free speech that is critical of the royal family. In December the Thailand Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/thailand-parliament-passes-controversial-cyber-crime-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a controversial cyber-crimes bill that gave the government the right to obtain user data without court approval, which rights groups feared would give the government unrestricted power to police the web and suppress criticism. In September Thailand's Bangkok South Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailand-court-finds-uk-labor-activist-guilty-of-defamation.php">found</a> [JURIST report] British labor rights activist Andy Hall guilty of criminal defamation and violating cyber crime laws. About a week earlier the same month Thailand's military government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailand-junta-to-stop-prosecuting-dissidents-in-military-courts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will prosecute cases concerning national security and "royal insult" in civilian courts, as opposed to military courts where the cases have been tried since 2014.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.southerncoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/show_temp.pl-1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that two congressional districts were invalid. A panel composed of Circuit Judge Smith, Chief District Judge Garcia and District Judge Rodriguez found that District 27 and District 35 were invalid pursuant to the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/voting_rights_1965.asp">Voting Rights Act</a> [materials] and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. District 27 was found to be invalid because it was drawn to deny Hispanic voters the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, and District 35 was found to be invalid because race was the primary factor in drawing the district. Central to the controversy was the removal of Nueces County, a predominantly Hispanic area, into District 27 and the placement of Travis County into District 35. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-reacts-to-courts-redistricting-ruling">said</a> [press release] the state plans to appeal this ruling to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Voting rights and how voters are grouped and counted has become and increasingly important issue over the past year. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-wisconsin-partisan-gerrymandering-case.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to hear a Wisconsin gerrymandering case. Earlier in June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-affirms-order-finding-north-carolina-racial-gerrymandering.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting of Districts 1 and 12 was unconstitutional because the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In January the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. In April of last year the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oregon <a href="https://katebrownfororegon.com/">Governor Kate Brown</a> [official website] signed a <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB3391/Introduced">bill</a> [text, PDF] into law on Tuesday that expands access to abortions and birth control. The bill prohibits health benefit plans from imposing a deductible, coinsurance, copayment or any other cost sharing requirements on services such as abortions or birth control. Additionally, the bill allows state funds to be used to provide reproductive healthcare to non-citizens who are not eligible for Medicaid. There is an exception that allows employers to exclude coverage for abortions or contraceptives that are contrary to their religious beliefs. However, the employer must notify all of their employees in writing of all of the procedures that are not covered due to their religious objections. The provisions included in the bill were set to take effect immediately upon its passage.</p>

<p>Abortion and contraception access remain controversial issues. In June the Delaware Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that guarantees access to abortions. On the same day Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a series of abortion regulations into <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">law</a> [JURIST report]. In May President Donald Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood. In February the US House of Representatives approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and passed a <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. That same month the Florida Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the Mandatory Delay Law, which requires that a woman wait 24 hours after receiving counseling from a physician before she can have an abortion. Also in February the Pennsylvania Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions in a span of 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Thursday announced a settlement in a lawsuit against two psychologists who devised the torture techniques used on three former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prisoners. The ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/aclu-sues-psychologists-over-cia-torture-program.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in 2015 against psychologists James Mitchell and John "Bruce" Jessen, who allegedly designed and persuaded the CIA to adopt their torture techniques as official practice of the CIA. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to the following <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/cia-torture-psychologists-settle-lawsuit">joint statement</a> [ACLU press release]:<blockquote>Drs. Mitchell and Jessen acknowledge that they worked with the CIA to develop a program for the CIA that contemplated the use of specific coercive methods to interrogate certain detainees.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Gul Rahman was subjected to abuses in the CIA program that resulted in his death and in pain and suffering for his family, including his personal representative Obaidullah. Plaintiffs Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud were also subjected to coercive methods in the CIA program, which resulted in pain and suffering for them and their families.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs assert that they were subjected to some of the methods proposed by Drs. Mitchell and Jessen to the CIA, and stand by their allegations regarding the responsibility of Drs. Mitchell and Jessen.</p>

<p>Drs. Mitchell and Jessen assert that the abuses of Mr. Salim and Mr. Ben Soud occurred without their knowledge or consent and that they were not responsible for those actions. Drs. Mitchell and Jessen also assert that they were unaware of the specific abuses that ultimately caused Mr. Rahman's death and are also not responsible for those actions.</p>

<p>Drs. Mitchell and Jessen state that it is regrettable that Mr. Rahman, Mr. Salim, and Mr. Ben Soud suffered these abuses.</blockquote>Judge Justin Quackenbush of the <a href="http://www.waed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Washington</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/federal-judge-allows-lawsuit-over-cia-interrogation-techniques-to-proceed.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the psychologists' motion for summary judgment last week and the case was scheduled to go to trial September 5.</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, the psychologists personally took part in many of the torture sessions and oversaw the entire program's implementation. The two surviving plaintiffs are Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a fisherman from Tanzania, and Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a refugee at his time of capture. The third plaintiff, Gul Rahman, died, allegedly as a result of the torture. The lawsuit was filed under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text] after the release of the so-called "<a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/sscistudy1.pdf">Senate Torture Report</a>" [text, PDF] in 2014, which found the so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed during the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">ineffective</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/Main.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2017_05117.PDF">found</a> [order, PDF] that a Malian jihadist is liable for individual and collective reparations for overseeing the destruction of Muslim shrines in Timbuktu. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf">Ahmad Al Faqi</a> [case information, PDF] was found liable for for 2.7 million euros in expenses. In its order, the ICC stressed the importance of cultural heritage:<blockquote>Because of their purpose and symbolism, most cultural property and cultural heritage are unique and of sentimental value. As a result, they are not fungible or  readily replaceable. The destruction of international cultural heritage thus "carries a message of terror and helplessness; it destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness; and it renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations". It is an irreplaceable loss that negates humanity.</blockquote>The court noted that Al Mahdi is indigent and encouraged the Trust Funds for Victims (TFV) to complement the reparations award and submit a draft implementation plan by next February.</p>

<p>Al Mahdi <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/malian-jihadist-pleads-guilty-to-destroying-timbuktu-shrines-at-start-of-icc-trial.php">admitted his guilt</a> [JURIST report] when his trial began last August. He was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/icc-sentences-jihadist-for-destroying-timbuktu-muslim-shrines.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in September to nine years in prison. This was a historic case, marking the first time the ICC has tried and convicted someone for committing the war crime of demolishing religious buildings and historical monuments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A married same-sex couple filed a <a href="/paperchase/Dominguez%20v.%20Cherry%20Creek%20complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against a former employer on Thursday in the <a href="https://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] that alleges the company discriminated by refusing to provide spousal health insurance. Judith Dominguez was employed by <a href="https://www.cherrycreekmortgage.com/">Cherry Creek Mortgage</a> [official website] when she enrolled herself and her wife, Patricia Martinez, in the <a href="https://www.uhc.com/">UnitedHealthcare</a> [official website] plan offered by the company in 2016. When Dominguez attempted to re-enroll the following year, her application was denied because Cherry Creek only covers "spouses who are in a legal union between one man and one woman." The company also retroactively cancelled Martinez's coverage. Martinez, who suffered two heart attacks in 2015 and requires regular cardiology checkups, has received more than $40,000 in bills from care that was previously covered. Additionally, Dominguez says Cherry Creek retaliated against her when she filed a complaint with <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> [official website] by moving her to a branch office that was soon closing and then firing her. An attorney for Cherry Creek <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-same-sex-marriage-benefits-suit-20170817-story.html">said</a> [LAT report] that the company does not comment on pending litigation but a representative of UnitedHealthcare stated that Cherry Creek is a "Christian-based company" and that as their healthcare provider, they are obligated to operate at the company's direction.</p>

<p>LGBT protections are still disputed and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. In July the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/doj-title-vii-does-not-protect-against-discrimination-based-on-sexual-orientation.php">filed an amicus curiae brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a man who claims he was fired for his sexual orientation. The Supreme Court of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/texas-supreme-court-denies-benefits-to-same-sex-couples.php">held</a> [JURIST report] earlier in July that the Houston's benefits policy need not extend to same-sex couples. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-court-lifts-injunction-on-controversial-mississippi-religious-objection-bill.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a Mississippi law that critics say allows individuals, including government employees, to discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people for religious reasons. Also in June the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-north-carolina-same-sex-marriage-recusal-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's Senate Bill 2, which allows magistrates to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if doing so would conflict with their religious beliefs. In May the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. In February the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-citys-lgbt-protections.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Fayetteville city ordinance broadening nondiscrimination laws to include sexual orientation or gender identity was invalid under a state statute that prohibited cities from adopting or enforcing ordinances prohibiting discrimination beyond what is barred by state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's new chief prosecutor announced plans on Thursday to pursue and imprison those responsible for leading violent protests that have plagued the country since April. The statement came the day before a proposed measure targeting hate crimes was expected to be approved by President Nicolás Maduro's National Constituent Assembly (ANC). The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN1AY01T">vaguely-worded bill</a> [Reuters report] will punish those found guilty of hate or intolerance with up to 25 years imprisonment. Critics of the bill, which include advocacy groups such as <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], fear the new law is aimed at silencing dissent and opposition. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21948&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] earlier this month that government security forces are responsible for at least 46 of the 124 deaths that occurred during the political unrest, and that another 27 deaths can be tied to armed pro-government groups called "colectivos." The report attributes the violence and abuses carried out during the protests to "the breakdown of the rule of law in Venezuela" and that the "responsibility for the human rights violations we are recording lies at the highest levels of Government." </p>

<p>Venezuela has been going through significant political unrest between the government and anti-government opposition recently. Earlier this month Venezuela's ANC <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuela-constituent-assembly-creates-truth-commission.php">created</a> [JURIST report] a Commission for Truth, Justice and Public Legitimacy that will be able to strip the public duties from those that are found to have acted in the protests. Also in August the Venezuela Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuelan-government-cracks-down-on-opposition-amid-uns-calls-to-cease-violence-against-protestors-.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] and removal of the mayor of Chacao, Ramon Muchacho. Muchacho was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he refused to take down barricades set up during anti-government demonstrations. In July violent protests <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-controversial-election-results-in-deadly-protests.php">erupted</a> [JURIST report] after a controversial election for a new assembly that would have the power to rewrite the nation's constitution. Earlier in July Venezuela's opposition party <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike to be held in response to the scheduled election. A <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">non-binding referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier in July in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. In October the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">voted to open criminal impeachmen</a>t [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/">El Salvador Legislative Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/noticias/archivo-de-noticias/asamblea-legislativa-prohibe-el-matrimonio-infantil">unanimously voted</a> [press release, Spanish] on Thursday to eliminate a law that allowed men to marry minors that they had impregnated. The legal age to marry in El Salvador was 18 even before this change. But, a 23-old exceptional rule allowed those under 18 to wed with parental consent. That exception has been widely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-marriage-idUSKCN1AY01I">abused</a> [Reuters report], particularly in rural areas, where families have been marrying off daughters to their alleged rapists with an intention to protect the "family honor," and so that the girl would not have to care for the child on her own. The exception also protected rapists and other sex offenders from criminal prosecution. This change leaves the legal age of consent intact at 18, but strikes down the exception that allowed these "honor marriages." According to El Salvador government data, there are more than 22,000 minors who are married or co-habiting. <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [child advocacy website] welcomed the change stating that the "reform is an important element to begin to generate a change of conduct ... This is a cultural question that has roots in the discriminatory, patrimonial practices facing girls" in El Salvador. </p>

<p>The issue of child marriage has been a matter of international concern for several years. In February, the Bangladesh Parliament passed revisions to the <a href="/paperchase/Child%20Marriage%20Restraint%20Act%20of%202017.pdf">Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017</a> [text, PDF], allowing girls <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/bangladesh-passes-law-allowing-some-child-marriages.php">under the age of 18 to be married</a> [JURIST report] under "special circumstances." The revisions did not change the minimum marriage age requirements but instead, they designate a committee of local officials to review individual cases of underage marriage and determine whether they may be approved by the court. In July 2016, officials in Gambia and Tanzania <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/gambia-and-tanzania-outlaw-child-marriage-practices.php">banned the practice of child marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2015, the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/guatemala-raises-marriage-age-to-18.php">Guatemalan Congress approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] to raise the legal age for marriage to 18. In April 2015, Malawi <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-welcomes-malawi-marriage-act.php">raised the legal age for marriage age to 18</a> [JURIST report] for both boys and girls. The move came after <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-calls-on-malawi-to-end-childhood-marriage.php">called on Malawi to end the practice</a> [JURIST report], detailing how child marriage exposes girls to domestic and sexual violence. In 2014, Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/bangladesh-officials-approve-child-marriage-prevention-law.php">officials approved</a> [JURIST report] the Child Marriage Prevention Act of 2014, requiring a two-year jail term for any person who marries a girl under the age of 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former inmate of the White County Jail, Christel Ward, <a href="/paperchase/Ward%20v.%20Shoupe%20-%20Eugenics%20federal%20suit%20against%20Tennessee.pdf">filed suit</a> [Complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.tnmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee</a> [official website], Northeastern Division on Thursday claiming that her constitutional rights had been violated when she was offered free birth control in exchange for a promised sentence reduction. Ward claims that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2017-08-17/lawsuit-sterilization-for-sentencing-breaks-violated-rights">she still has the unwanted birth control device</a> [AP report] in her arm, and her sentence was ultimately never reduced. The complaint names in particular <a href="http://whitecosheriff.org/">Sheriff Oddie Shoupe</a> [official website], Deputy Donna Daniels, and Tennessee state Judge Sam Benningfield as defendants and alleges that the birth-control-for-sentence-reduction<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>policy is Eugenics with-a-twist: an official program ratified and implemented by Sheriff Shoupe that dangled a 30-day reduction in jail time, but only in exchange for Ms. Ward and other convicted misdemeanants giving up their constitutional right to procreate, by agreeing to some form of sterilization (vasectomy for males; three-to-five-year birth-control implant for women). This unconstitutional program strikes at the very heart of voluntary consent because consent is no consent at all&#8212;when consent is unduly coerced by government officials. </blockquote></p>

<p>Borrowing a famous quote from the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the complaint further alleged that the policy has deemed Ward and other prison inmates at the White County jail as "the problem of the unfit," "feeble minded," and "imbeciles." Benningfield had <a href="http://www.aclu-tn.org/white-county-judge-rescinds-order-coercing-sterilization-and-birth-control/">rescinded his order</a> [ACLU press release] implementing the policy in July amid pressure from the <a href="http://www.aclu-tn.org/">ACLU of Tennessee</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health">state health department</a> [official website]. Ward is just one among many White County jail inmates who underwent the allegedly coerced birth control procedures.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to be a controversial issue in the US with the issue escalating after the election of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile]. Earlier this week, Oregon <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/gov/Pages/index.aspx">Governor Kate Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/oregon-governor-signs-bill-expanding-coverage-of-abortions-and-birth-control.php">signed a bill into law</a> [JURIST report] that expands access to abortions and birth control and prohibits health benefit plans from imposing a deductible, coinsurance, copayment or any other cost sharing requirements on such services. In June, Texas <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website] signed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">series of abortion regulations</a> [JURIST report] into law requiring the burial or cremation of fetal tissue, banning the donation of fetal tissue, and banning abortions performed though partial-birth or dilation and evacuation procedures. On that same day, the <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware General Assembly</a> [official website] approved a bill ensuring that the <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">provisions of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> remain legal</a> [JURIST report] at the state level should the historical case be overturned. In February, the US <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> (the House) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] overturning the Obama administration law prohibiting states from denying federal funding to <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. The previous week, the <a href="http://www.pasen.gov/">Pennsylvania Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks. In January, the House <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-house-approves-bill-prohibiting-use-of-federal-money-for-abortions.php">passed</a> [JURIST Report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr7/BILLS-115hr7rfs.pdf">No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017</a> [text, PDF] that makes <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">permanent</a> [JURIST report] certain restrictions on federal funding for abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three democracy activists were jailed on Thursday for participating in the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, which lead to thousands of Hong Kong citizens protesting on Sunday in opposition of their imprisonment. Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-idUSKCN1B00CK">convicted</a> [Reuters report] to be imprisoned for six to eight months for the charge of unlawful assembly. According one of the protest organizers,  Sunday's protests held the highest number of participants since the 2014 protests with an estimate of 23,000 people. According to protestors, the conviction is politically motivated. The sentence disqualifies Wong, Law, and Chow from running for legislature for the next five years.</p>

<p>In 1997 Hong Kong returned to rule under China under a "one country, two systems" setup that was to protect Hong Kong's freedoms. and autonomy However, some in Hong Kong feel as that China has too much political control over their affairs. In July the <a href="http://www.hkcfa.hk/en/home/index.html">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/hong-kong-high-court-remove-lawmakers-from-office.php">voided</a> [JURIST report] the oaths of office of four opposition lawmakers and removed them from the legislature. Among the four disqualified lawmakers were 24-year-old Nathan Law, leader of the 2014 "Umbrella movement" protests. In November 2016 the Hong Kong Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/hong-kong-court-bans-elected-officials-from-taking-office.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against two elected, pro-independence politicians from taking local office. That caused more than 1,000 Hong Kong lawyers, dressed in black, <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/hong-kong-lawyers-march-to-oppose-china-blocking-pro-democratic-lawmakers-from-taking-legislative-se.php">to march</a> [JURIST report] through the city in opposition of the decision. In January an estimated 5,000 people <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/new-years-day-protests-take-place-in-hong-kong.php">marched in Hong Kong</a> [JURIST report] in support of pro-democracy politicians who were similarly barred from taking office the previous year for altering their oaths office. In August a Hong Kong court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/hong-kong-protest-leaders-avoid-jail-time-at-sentencing.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three leaders, who participated in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, of unlawful assembly and inciting others to join the assembly. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar's parliament amended the <a href="http://www.mcit.gov.mm/sites/default/files/Telecom%20Law%20English%20Version_0.pdf">2013 Telecommunications Law</a> [text, PDF] on Friday amidst growing concerns regarding the freedom of expression. The new law <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-media-idUSKCN1AY13J">permits</a> [Reuters report] judges to release people on bail, allows only those directly affected, or with permission from those directly affected, by the offense to press charges, and reduces the maximum prison sentence to two years. However, many in opposition of the law say that the amendments do little to reduce the restrictions on speech. Clause 66(d) of the law prohibits the "extorting, coercing, restraining wrongfully, defaming, disturbing, causing undue influence or threatening to any person by using any Telecommunications Network." Under this clause, journalists have been arrested, such as activist Maung Daung Kha who was imprisoned for six months for defamation. According to Kha, "freedom of expression is still being threatened as long as clause 66(d) exists." In June human rights groups released a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/29/burma-repeal-section-66d-2013-telecommunications-law">joint statement</a> [press release] declaring that the law was being used "to stifle criticism of the authorities" and urging authorities to repeal the law due to its vagueness.  However, members of the Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy say that the law reduces hate speech and false news. According to the advocacy group Research Term for the law, 17 journalists have been charged or arrested since last year.</p>

<p>Human rights violations have been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. In July the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/un-rights-expert-voices-concern-over-worsening-situation-in-myanmar.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] voicing concern over the worsening human rights situation in Myanmar. In February Myanmar officials promised to <a href=/paperchase/2017/02/myanmar-to-investigate-alleged-police-crimes-against-rohingya-muslims.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] whether police have committed crimes against Rohingya Muslims. In June a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-expert-fundamentalism-harming-rights-to-assembly-and-association.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] a report on religious, free market, political, and nationalist or cultural fundamentalism, stating that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. In April, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon<a href="paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php"> expressed</a> [JURIST report] shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries; the government of Myanmar alone <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military in March as part of a UN join action plan made in 2012. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that they say has the advocacy organization says has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly. Also in May US Secretary of State John Kerry offered support to Myanmar's newly democratic government and <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/kerry-urges-myanmar-to-promote-further-human-rights-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the country to push more democratic reform and address human rights issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Before Monday's ruling, Chile was one of a few nations where abortion was illegal in all instances. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Dhaka court on Sunday sentenced 10 individuals to death for plotting to bomb a rally held by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. According to prosecutors, members of the Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami group <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/bangladesh-sentences-10-death-plot-kill-pm-170821085019416.html">planted</a> [Al Jazeera report] two bombs at the rally's college campus location just one day before Hasina was scheduled to arrive. The group's former leader, Mufti Abdul Hannan, was allegedly involved in the plot, though Hannan was already hung in April for a separate criminal matter. Ten other suspects allegedly involved in the plot have been acquitted due to lack of evidence. The sentenced individuals' lawyers have expressed their intention to appeal the sentence. This matter marks one of many attacks which have been blamed on the suspects' Islamist group. </p>

<p>Bangladesh courts have delivered numerous death sentences within the last year. In January a Bangladesh court  <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/bangladesh-court-sentences-26-to-death-for-murder.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 26 people to death by hanging for murder. In August 2016 UN humans rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-quash-death-sentence-imposed-on-opposition-leader.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Bangladesh to repeal the death sentence imposed upon Mir Quasem Ali, an opposition member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. Also in August 2016  the <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-former-mp-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a former member of parliament to death and seven others to life in prison for crimes committed during the 1971 war for independence. In June 2016 the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-man-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Mohibur Rahman to death for his part in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] released a <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/unama-human-rights-report-mass-killings-mirza-olang">special report</a> [text] on Sunday detailing the human rights violations committed during attacks on the Mirza Olang village earlier this month. During the three-day event, Taliban and local Islamic State (IS) fighters <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/unama-human-rights-report-mass-killings-mirza-olang">reportedly killed</a> [press release] at least 36 people in the predominantly Shi'ite Muslim village. Those killed included both civilians and members of a pro-government militia who were unarmed prior to execution. While UNAMA verified the killings and the separation of women and children, it could not verify other claims of beheadings, abductions of women, or sexual assault. Further investigations are required to ascertain whether the attacks amounted to sectarian violence. According to the report, "These killings, corroborated by multiple credible sources, constitute violations of international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes." The Taliban has since <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/un-probe-concludes-taliban-islamic-state-jointly-killed-36-afghans/3993091.html">rejected</a> [VOA report] the report's claims and denied the involvement of IS fighters. </p>

<p>Civilian casualties continue to be a primary issue in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. Last month, UNAMA <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/un-report-condemns-increase-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] condemning an increase in civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017. In February at least 20 people were reported to have been killed and 41 injured following a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/afghanistan-supreme-court-attack-kills-20.php">terrorist attack</a> [JURIST report] at the Supreme Court in Kabul, Afghanistan. In February of last year UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high 11,000 in 2015. In June of last year, three Taliban gunmen <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/taliban-gunmen-attack-afghanistan-court-building-killing-prosecutor.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor. In November 2015 the US Department of Defense and Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/pentagon-determines-human-error-caused-afghanistan-hospital-bombing.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing of the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, and <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/631359/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-campbell-via-teleconference-fro/">announced</a> [official statement] that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2016/6716/6716_2016_Order_22-Aug-2017.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Tuesday that Islam's instant divorce law, which allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives by saying the word "talaq" three times, was unconstitutional. The case was heard by five judges of the court and resulted in a vote of 3-2. The court found that the practice was gender discriminatory and noted that several countries with sizable Muslim populations do not allow the talaq instant divorce. The court has given a six-month period for the talaq divorce to be redefined or simply done away with altogether. No husband is allowed to use the talaq divorce during this period. The <a href="http://www.aimplboard.in/">All India Muslim Personal Law Board</a> (AIMPLB) [official website] filed an affidavit stating that they will recommend that during marriages, the husband not utilize the talaq divorce. However, the AIMPLB has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-religion-idUSKCN1B20D1">stated</a> [Reuters report] that they will contest the ruling. The ruling was supported by India's prime minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>In recent years, several practices of Islam have come under scrutiny throughout the world as being discriminatory against women. The practice of wearing a burka has seen several cases on both sides of the debate. In April, a Hungary court ruled to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hungary-constitutional-court-repeals-village-ban-on-burkas.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] a village's ban on burkas. In February Bavaria <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/bavaria-approves-partial-ban-on-full-face-veil.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on full-face veils in certain public spaces. Later that month the <a href="http://www.msb.gov.tr/">Turkish Ministry of Defense</a> [official website, in Turkish] announced that female soldiers will be allowed to wear headscarves along with their uniforms. In December German Chancellor Angela Merkel <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/germany-chancellor-endorses-partial-ban-on-full-face-veils.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on burqas and niqabs, saying that "the full facial veil is inappropriate and should be banned wherever is legally possible." Also in December the Netherlands legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/Netherlands-legislature-votes-in-favor-of-partial-burka-ban.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a partial burka ban. However, in July 2016 the EU's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/eu-court-backs-french-woman-dismissed-for-wearing-head-scarf.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a French woman who was fired for wearing a head scarf.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong confessed at a trial on Tuesday to attempting to overthrow the Chinese government. Jiang has been in custody since November of last year. At the trial, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/world/asia/jian-tianyong-trial-china-activist-human-rights.html?mcubz=0">stated</a> [NYT report] that Western laws led him to attempt to overthrow the country's Communist government and that he helped fabricate tales of torture for another human rights lawyer, Xie Yang, who had a trial in May. Jiang has represented human rights issues in China for over 10 years. The Chinese government had removed his law license in 2009. Supporters of Jiang , including his wife, have stated that his confession was coerced after being tortured. Sentencing for Jiang will take place at a later undetermined date. </p>

<p>Many human rights lawyers and defenders in China have seen been the target of the Chinese government in recent years. In February, the <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/">Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing crackdowns of human rights defenders by China. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of Jiang Tianyong,</a> [JURIST report]  after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. In September China handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">12 year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July 2016 China announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. In April 2016 a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested and released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?lang=en">UN Assistance Mission to Iraq</a> (UNAMI) [official website] published a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IQ/UNAMIReport22Aug2017_EN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday urging the Iraqi government to ensure the rights of those individuals sexually victimized by Islamic State (IS) forces. According to the report, thousands of women and girls have been subjected to physical and mental abuses as result of sexual assault, abduction, slavery, displacement, forced religion changes, and other forms of inhumane treatment. While the Iraqi government has taken some positive steps to address these abuses, the report states that the government is legally obligated to ensure that all victims have proper access to justice, receive adequate care for recovery, and may be reintegrated into their families and communities. The report also calls on the government to prevent women and children from being discriminated against due to their connections with IS. As UN High Commissioner <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/profiles/zeid-ra%E2%80%99ad-al-hussein">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21986&LangID=E">stated</a> [press release], "Children who were born in ISIL-controlled areas have the same legal rights as any other Iraqi citizen, and the Government must ensure they are protected from marginalisation and abuse." The report concludes with various recommendations for the government including improvements to the judicial system, increased access to supportive services, and raising awareness for the rights of all victims. </p>

<p>The preservation of human rights and equal treatment of women continues to be an international concern. In June <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/human-rights-watch-pregnant-and-married-african-girls-denied-education.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that millions of pregnant and married girls across Africa are being denied education due to discriminatory policies. Also in June a UN expert presented a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-end-to-gender-based-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN Human Rights Council calling for governments to do more to reduce violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. That same day the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. Conversely, the day before Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed [JURIST report] a series of abortion regulations into law. In March HRW sent a letter and a memorandum to the speaker of the Iraqi parliament with <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-iraq-should-increase-protection-for-victims-in-proposed-domestic-violence-bill.php">recommendations</a> [JURIST report] for amendments to a proposed domestic violence bill. Also in March the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Australia to include all women in the fight to end gender-based violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.lacourt.org/"> Los Angeles Superior Court</a> [official website] issued a verdict on Monday in favor of a consumer who allegedly developed ovarian cancer after using a drug manufacturer's talc-based products. Defendant <a href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson and Johnson</a> [corporate website] currently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit-idUSKCN1B121D">faces</a> [Reuters report] about 4,800 claims regarding the company's failure to warn consumers of cancer risks linked to such products. In the current case, the plaintiff was awarded $417 million in damages, which is the largest verdict awarded in the matter thus far. According to the plaintiff, the drug manufacturer has failed to acknowledge studies linking ovarian cancer to genital talc use. Johnson and Johnson, however, has stated that studies and federal agencies have not found their talc-based products to be carcinogenic. The manufacturer has expressed its intention to appeal the verdict and support the safety of its products. </p>

<p>Johnson and Johnson is currently amongst several manufacturers involved in a national opioid crisis that has risen to an epidemic level in recent years. In June, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/missouri-ag-suing-opioid-manufacturers.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against three of the largest opioid manufacturers, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and units of Endo International Plc., accusing them of violating consumer protection laws by using deception to hide the addicting and life-threatening nature of their products. Also in June, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general from Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas announced<a href="/paperchase/2017/06/state-attorney-generals-investigate-opioid-drug-companies.php">joint investigations</a> [JURIST report] into the marketing and sales practices of the manufacturers of opioid painkillers. In March President Donald Trump signed an <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] establishing a task force to combat the opioid crisis. This would not be the first time that opioid drug manufacturers have found themselves in trouble with the law. In July 2007 the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pharma.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1185030508-pdFqUnDAEbi6OEAMOlKLXg">sentenced</a> [NYT report] three former executives of the Purdue Frederick Company, manufacturer of painkiller <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111085.htm">OxyContin</a> [FDA materials], to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service in drug treatment programs. The three executives, including former president Michael Friedman, former chief in-house counsel Howard Udell, and former medical director Paul Goldenheim, all <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oxycontin-maker-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 to a misdemeanor offense of misbranding a drug. Prosecutors had alleged that the company and executives were aware in 1995 that doctors were concerned about the drug's high addiction risk, but its sales representatives continued to misrepresent OxyContin's effects to physicians. Purdue Frederick agreed to pay $634.5 million in fines for its role in misleading the public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missouri <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Eric Greitens</a> [official website] <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/sites/governor/files/Executive%20Order%2017-20.pdf?utm_content=bufferbee5e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=buffer">issued</a> [order, PDF] a stay of execution for Marcellus Williams who was scheduled to be executed on Tuesday. Williams was <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/governor-greitens-issues-stay-execution-appoints-gubernatorial-board-inquiry-marcellus">sentenced</a> [press release] to death in 2001 after being convicted of the first-degree murder of Felicia Gayle. Greitens decided to grant the stay of execution due to newly discovered DNA evidence, which Williams claims proves his innocence. The executive order will establish a Board of Inquiry, which will be made of five people appointed by Greitens. The board will consider all evidence, including the new DNA evidence and all evidence presented to the jury during the original trial. After assessing the weight and credibility of all evidence, the board will then provide a recommendation to the governor on if Williams should be executed or his sentence commuted. </p>

<p>The death penalty has been the focal point of an ongoing debate in the US for many years. In March Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a new law that required a unanimous recommendation from the jury before a judge may sentence someone to death. Also in March the <a href="https://courts.arkansas.gov/courts/supreme-court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-supreme-court-allows-planned-executions-to-go-forward.php">order</a> [JURIST report] stating there was no stay in place preventing the execution of eight inmates scheduled for the following month. In February the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. Also in February a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-delaying-ohio-exeuctions.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction that delays executions in Ohio. In January Judge Michael Merz <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21990&LangID=E">requested</a> [Press release] that the US government, high-level politicians and public officials "unequivocally and unconditionally reject and condemn racist hate speech and crimes in Charlottesville and throughout the country." Although the committee did not call out President Donald Trump by name, it specified that the response to Charlottesville was a "failure at the highest political level." The committee also requested that the US ensure the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are not used to promote racist hate speech and racist crimes. CERD monitors the implementation of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [Text], which the United States ratified in 1994.</p>

<p>The violence in Charlottesville occurred on August 12 when a "Unite the Right" rally took place to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the recently renamed Emancipation Park. The rally drew members of white nationalist groups who marched through the streets of Charlottesville the night before carrying torches and chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. Counter-protesters clashed with these groups during the protest, and 34 were injured. In addition, two state troopers were killed on the same day when the helicopter they were using to monitor the protests crashed. Earlier this month, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/sessions-orders-federal-probe-into-charlottesville-violence.php">federal civil rights investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015e-111f-d354-abfe-b1bf98560000">blocked</a> [order, PDF] Texas from enforcing a revised <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB5">voter identification law</a> [SB 5 materials].</p>

<p>Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos had previously found that a <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/SB00014I.pdf#navpanes=0">2011 law</a> [SB 14 materials], which required voters to present a form of government-issued ID, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rules-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">discriminated</a> [JURIST report] against blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-bill-loosening-voter-id-laws.php">revised law</a> [JURIST report], which had been set to take effect in January, would permit voters to sign an affidavit and show other forms of identification. However, Ramos found that the revisions did not fix the problems of the original legislation:<blockquote>SB 5 was passed only after SB 14 was held to be unconstitutionally discriminatory and while the remedies phase of this case remained pending, and a large part of what makes SB  14 discriminatory&#8212;placing a disproportionate burden on Hispanics and African-Americans through the selection of qualified photo IDs&#8212;remains essentially unchanged in SB 5.</blockquote>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the state <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-texas-will-appeal-todays-voter-id-ruling">plans to appeal</a> [press release].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A nine-judge panel of the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/pdf/jud/ALL%20WP(C)%20No.494%20of%202012%20Right%20to%20Privacy.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Thursday that privacy is a "constitutionally protected value." The ruling could have drastic consequences for the government&#8212;particularly the country's biometric identification program, <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/your-aadhaar/about-aadhaar.html">Aadhaar</a> [official website]. The judgment outlined the history of privacy and fundamental rights, not only in India but other countries as well. The court overruled two previous court rulings on privacy and stated that privacy is a "constitutional core of human dignity."</p>

<p>Privacy has been a hot topic around the world in recent months. Last month a US federal district judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-trump-voting-commission-data-request-is-allowed.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] President Donald Trump's election commission to move forward by dismissing the need for a prior privacy impact assessment before collecting voter data. In June Japan's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/japan-parliament-approves-controversial-counterterrorism-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a controversial "anti-conspiracy" bill aimed at improving security and combating terrorism that critics claim will violate privacy rights. Also in June the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland infringed a woman's right to equality and privacy when it forced her to travel to the UK to receive an abortion when diagnosed with fatal fetal syndrome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Thai prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile] failed to appear in court to hear the verdict in her trial Friday, amid reports that she had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/asia/yingluck-shinawatra-flees-thailand/index.html">fled the country to Dubai</a> [CNN report].</p>

<p>Yingluck was facing corruption charges involving mismanagement of a rice-subsidy program, estimated to have cost the government billions of dollars. She <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-relating-to-rice-scheme.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to the charges in 2015 and <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/thailand-ex-pm-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST reports] last year. </p>

<p>A warrant was issued for her arrest after she failed to appear in court Friday. She had been barred from leaving the country since 2015 and faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Thailand's political system has been unstable since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5361512.stm">2006 military coup</a> [BBC report] by the Royal Thai Army against then-prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile], brother of Yingluck. Yingluck herself was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-pm-ordered-to-step-down-for-abuse-of-power.php">removed from office</a> in May 2014 shortly before the <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">military seized control</a> [JURIST reports] of the government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A South Korean court sentenced billionaire head of <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jay-y-lee/">Lee Jae-yong</a> [Forbes backgrounder] to five years in jail for bribery on Friday. The <a href="http://seoul.scourt.go.kr/main/new/Main.work">Seoul Central District Court</a> [official website, in Korean] found that Lee paid former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20787271">Park Geun-hye</a> [BBC profile] in hopes of favors from Park. Lee was also<a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2017/08/25/0302000000AEN20170825001354315.html"> convicted</a> [Yonhap report] for embezzlement, hiding assets overseas, concealment of criminal proceeds, and perjury leading prosecutors to originally ask for a 12-year sentence. There were four other former Samsung executives that were also convicted in connection to this case.</p>

<p>This is the most recent development in a governmental scandal that has grown to involve many top former officials and corporate executives. In May former South Korean president Park Geun-hye <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/south-korea-former-president-denies-all-charges-as-trial-opens.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] all charges as she pleaded not guilty at the beginning of her trial.  In February South Korea's special prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/south-korea-indicts-former-culture-minister-top-aide-for-abuse-of-power.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] former culture minister Yoon-sun Cho] and former presidential chief of staff Ki-choon Kim on charges of coercion, abuse of power and perjury connected to creation of a blacklist of opposition artists critical to Park. Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-south-korea-president-arrested.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking government secrets on March 31.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President <a href="http://whitehouse.gov">Donald Trump</a> [official website] on Friday pardoned former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Joe%20Arpaio&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Joe Arpaio</a> [JURIST archive]. In a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/08/25/545282459/president-trump-pardons-former-sheriff-joe-arpaio">brief announcement</a> [NPR report] issued Friday night, the White House said that Arpaio's military service and law enforcement tenure warranted the pardon.<blockquote>Arpaio's life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. After serving in the Army, Arpaio became a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, NV and later served as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), formerly the Bureau of Narcotics. After 25 years of admirable service, Arpaio went on to lead the DEA's branch in Arizona.</p>

<p>In 1992, the problems facing his community pulled Arpaio out of retirement to return to law enforcement. He ran and won a campaign to become Sheriff of Maricopa County. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] had found Arpaio <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/former-arizona-sheriff-found-guilty-of-criminal-contempt.php">guilty of criminal contempt</a> [JURIST report]  late last month after finding that he had violated an earlier court order "by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates' compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed." </p>

<p>The criminal conviction for contempt that was addressed by Friday's pardon stems from a 2012 lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/doj-files-discrimination-suit-against-arizona-sheriff.php">filed by the Department of Justice</a> [JURIST report] alleging that Arpaio and his department engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory and unlawful law enforcement actions against Latinos through frequent stops, detentions and arrests "on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and Latino prisoners with limited English language skills are denied important constitutional protections." Friday's pardon is the first in Trump's short tenure as president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President <a href="http://whitehouse.gov">Donald Trump</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="/documents/presidentialmemos/2017/08/presidential-memorandum-for-the-secretary-of-defense-and-the-secretary-of-homeland-security.php">directed</a> [Presidential Memorandum] the Secretaries of the Departments of <a href="https://www.defense.gov/">Defense</a> (DoD) and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official websites] to continue prior policies banning transgender individuals from military service. The ban had been <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ban-on-transgender-service-members-lifted.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration last July, reversing a long-standing policy that prevented transgender persons from serving in the military and made a transgender identity grounds for discharge. In rescinding this change of policy, Trump said that he was unconvinced that sufficient proof had been presented about the effect of the change on military performance.<br />
<blockquote>In my judgment, the previous Administration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments' longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study is needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year's policy change would not have those negative effects.</blockquote> Trump directed the DoD and DHS to continue preventing service by transgender individuals "until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above" and/or "until such time as the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that I find convincing." </p>

<p>Trump's directive also instructs the departments to "halt all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex." </p>

<p>Although the memorandum is not effective until January 2018, the departments had previously extended the Obama administration's July 2017 deadline until January 2018 pending further study.</p>

<p>Trump announced the reversal in policy in a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890193981585444864">series</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890196164313833472">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890197095151546369">tweets</a> on July 26. Five unnamed transgender servicemembers <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/transgender-servicemembers-sue-trump-administration-over-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in response to the tweets, alleging that re-imposition of the ban would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection components of the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. The case, seeking injunctive relief, is currently pending before the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guatemala's Constitutional Court issued an order Sunday blocking the expulsion of the lead UN anti-corruption official only hours after President Jimmy Morales ordered his expulsion. Morales argued that Ivan Velasquez, head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website] misused his authoritative position by pressuring the legislative process and publicly accusing Guatemalans of violations without respecting their due process rights. The same day of his announcement, Morales fired the foreign minister for failure to execute the order and replaced him with another who is currently under investigation for illegal adoptions. According to a spokesperson for the US <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/08/273664.htm">State Department</a> [press release], Velasquez has acted as the lead in efforts to combat corruption and impunity  in Guatemala for a decade.  The US, Germany, Canada, Spain, France, UK, Sweden, Switzerland and the EU <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-latest-backers-bemoan-expulsion-by-guatemala-president/2017/08/27/87c627e4-8b40-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?utm_term=.13f7e874cc66"">issued</a> [WP report] a joint statement expressing their opposition to Morales attempt to expel Velasquez, stating that "[the commission plays]." Prior to Morales' expulsion order, Velasquez and Guatemala chief prosecutor announced on Friday plans to remove Morales' immunity in order to investigate how he financed his 2015 campaign, alleging he has not accounted for more than $800,000 in funding and has hidden his party's accounts. Citizens, in protest of Morales, declared a state of siege in the capital, and some ministers resigned. A ruling on the request to void Morales' immunity is currently being decided.</p>

<p>Guatemala has a history of political scandal. Former president Otto Pérez Molina and ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti were <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/guatemala-ex-president-accused-of-corruption.php">accused</a> JURIST report] of taking nearly 130 million in bribes in the beginning of 2011 by Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana. In August 2015 the Guatemalan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach Molina after he announced his intent to not resign after the scandal broke. In October, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-office-welcomes-new-guatemalan-draft-bill-on-constitutional-justice-r.php">welcomed a draft bill</a> [JURIST report] on constitutional justice reforms in the Guatemala legislature, which "represents an historic opportunity to consolidate the remarkable progress the country has achieved in the fight against impunity and corruption in recent years." In June a Guatemalan judge who served as general secretary for Guatemala's soccer federation <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/guatemala-judge-pleads-guilty-in-fifa-fraud-case.php">pled guilty</a> [JURIST report] to fraud and conspiracy in the FIFA scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Civil rights groups on Monday filed two separate lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the US military. <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/news/us_20170726_lambda-legal-and-outserve-sldn-will-sue-if-tweet-becomes-policy">Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN</a> [press release] filed a <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/karnoski_us_20170828_complaint">complaint</a> [text] in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington on behalf of a current army Staff Sergeant, two transgender individuals who wish to serve in the military, Human Rights Campaign and the Gender Justice League. The Lambda Legal complaint asserts causes of action for violation of the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantees of Equal Protection and Due Process along with the First Amendment right to free speech. The other <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_complaint_0.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] was filed by the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/secure/protect-rights-freedoms-we-believe-8?s_src=UNW170001SEM&alt_src=UNV170001SEM&ms=gad_SEM_Google_Search-Trump_ACLU%20Name%20Terms_aclu_e_173475662563">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [press release] in the US District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of six transgender people from numerous branches of the military. The ACLU's complaint asserts causes of action for violation of the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantees of Equal Protection and Due Process. Both of these complaints seek injunctive relief. The White House declined to comment about these two pending lawsuits. </p>

<p>Last week Trump formally <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-formally-issues-ban-on-transgender-military-service.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] the ban on transgender individuals serving in the US military. In addition to the ban, Trump also prohibited the use of military resources funding sex reassignment surgical procedures for military members except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex. Earlier in August five transgender service members <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/transgender-servicemembers-sue-trump-administration-over-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] after Trump announced his intentions on Twitter. These service members alleged that re-imposition of the ban would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection components of the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. That case, seeking injunctive relief, is currently pending before the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Trump's decision to re-implement the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military was first announced in <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890193981585444864">a series of tweets</a> in late July. The previous ban on transgender military service was <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ban-on-transgender-service-members-lifted.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] last July under then-president Barack Obama, reversing a long-standing policy that prevented transgender persons from serving in the military and made a transgender identity grounds for discharge. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenya Supreme Court ordered the election commission on Monday to allow Raila Odinga's National Super Alliance (NASA) and Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party limited access to its computer servers and electronic devices to assess the vote-count for themselves to verify the election's integrity. According to the election commission, Kenyatta won a second five-year term, which was substantiated by independent monitors of a sampling of 2,000 polling stations. Odinga's supporters allege that the results from more than one-third of the polling stations are "fatally flawed." According to the opposition's lawyer, some of the tally sheets were missing security features and an official stamp, which were designed to ensure the election process was conducted fairly, especially if the electronic systems were to fail. The court must provide a ruling by September 1 and if the opposition succeeds a new election must be held within 60 days.</p>

<p>The election has sparked violent protests, <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-protest-of-president-reelection-results-in-death-of-citizens.php">resulting</a> [JURIST report] in at least 24 people dead, according to the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website]. UN HIgh Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-chief-urges-kenya-leaders-to-avoid-post-election-violence.php">called on Kenyan leaders</a> [JURIST report] to "take the responsible path and exercise their leadership to avoid violence" after these deadly protests. Protests the following Kenya's 2007 election, which Odinga also lost, resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, triggering an International Criminal Court investigation and charges that were <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">ultimately dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/28/presidential-executive-order-restoring-state-tribal-and-local-law">executive order</a> [White House executive orders website] on Monday that will lift an Obama-era <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/16/executive-order-federal-support-local-law-enforcement-equipment-acquisit">directive</a> [text] that restricted local police agencies' access to military equipment. Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke Monday morning to the <a href="www.fop.net/">Fraternal Order of Police</a> (FOP) [union website] outlining the president's new executive order. The FOP and other law enforcement groups have led the push to reverse the Obama administration policy in order to better respond to local unrest. The Trump administration's <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/28/trump-resumes-sales-military-hardware-local-police/607613001/">objective</a> [USA Today report] of lifting the controversial ban is to recycle military surplus, distribute potentially lifesaving gear to local police, and to reinstate grants that local police may use to purchase military equipment from other sources. Trump's executive order will take effect immediately. </p>

<p>Trump's executive order reverses an Obama-era directive that sought to alleviate tensions following the aftermath of the Ferguson rioting. Ferguson gained international attention after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. The response to the shooting set off massive protests and social unrest. In October of 2014 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-dismisses-ferguson-protestors-lawsuit-against-police.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Ferguson protesters' lawsuit against police. In August of 2015 a new Municipal Court judge in Ferguson ordered sweeping reforms of courtroom practices following a damning federal report of <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/ferguson-judge-orders-substantial-changes-to-court-system.php">racial bias</a> [JURIST report]. The Department of Justice report released last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-report-no-prosecution-of-ferguson-police-officer.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] the former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson from federal prosecution for Brown's death. Former attorney general Eric Holder additionally stated that the report showed that racial disparities in police practices could not be alternatively explained other than through racial bias, which he says is proven through statistics and an examination of records and emails.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kenyan <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/files/2017/03/Vol.CXIX-No_.31_-1.pdf">ban</a> [<em>Kenya Gazette</em>, PDF] on plastic bags <a href="http://www.nema.go.ke/images/featured/Ban_on_plastic_bags.pdf">officially went into effect</a> [press release, PDF] Monday, six months after it was announced in February. The ban applies to Kenyans producing, selling or using plastic bags and carries a punishment of up to USD $40,000 or imprisonment of up to four years. Although the ban has a wide target audience, it will initially be enforced to target manufacturers. The plastic bags covered under the ban include carrier bags with handles and flat bags without handles. Kenya joins <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-plastic-idUSKCN1B80NW">more than 40 other nations</a> [Reuters report} that have enacted similar laws, but Kenya's is far more stringent than all of the others to date. Kenya hopes the ban will greatly reduce plastic pollution, but this goal is estimated to come at the expense of around 60,000 jobs lost.</p>

<p>Reducing pollution has long been a goal of countries all over the world. In June a group of environmentalists <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/environmentalists-sue-uk-government-over-air-pollution-plan.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK government alleging that the country's proposed plan for reducing the UK's air pollution was inadequate. In March an Indian Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/india-court-gives-rivers-same-legal-rights-as-person.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the Ganges and Yumana rivers the same legal rights as people in an effort to protect them from being polluted. In February UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-calls-for-strong-anti-pollution-legislation-and-enforcement.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] global leaders to take action by enacting strong anti-pollution legislation and strictly enforcing it. Earlier in February the European Commission gave <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-countries-given-final-warning-over-air-pollution.php">final warnings</a> [JURIST report] to Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the UK Wednesday for failing to address air pollution. Also in February New York's governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/new-york-governor-signs-bill-blocking-plastic-bag-fees.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] blocking fees for using plastic bags. In November a California plastic bag <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB270">ban</a> [bill, PDF] went into effect after it had been <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/california-plastic-bag-ban-halted-by-referendum-petition.php">halted</a> [JURIST report] by a referendum petition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the Kenyan presidential election on August 8, more than 12 people have been killed and more than 100 have been badly injured due to serious <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse">human rights violations</a> [HRW report], Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported Monday. Following the announcement of <a href="https://twitter.com/UKenyatta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Uhuru Kenyatta's</a> [official twitter] reelection, protests broke out in Nairobi, Coast, and the western counties of Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, and Homabay, which HRW says led to unlawful killings and beatings and house-to-house operations by police. In western Kenya, protesters threw stones at the police, to which the police responded with teargas canisters and water cannons to disperse the protesters. According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/UseOfForceAndFirearms.aspx">UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms</a> [text], law enforcement is only to use force in proportion to the seriousness of the offense and intentional use of lethal force is permitted only when unavoidable to protect life. HRW urged the Kenyan government to publicly acknowledge and condemn the unlawful actions by the police, to investigate the crimes committed by police, to hold the police accountable for their excessive force, and to protect the right to peacefully protest.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Kenya has been plagued with accusations of human rights violations. In March <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy International</a> [advocacy website] urged <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-kenya-police-investigative-practices.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the practices and surveillance techniques of police officers after releasing a report documenting the serious human rights abuses that have allegedly resulted. In February a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-kenya-to-cease-crackdowns-on-rights-groups.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Kenya to stop crackdowns on human rights group to protect the integrity of this upcoming election. In November a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-experts-condemn-kenya-violence-against-protesters-and-journalists.php">condemned reported violence</a> [JURIST report] against anti-corruption protesters and journalists in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Last year the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] withdrew <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta, who was accused of crimes against humanity for post-election violence, but indicated it would renew the charges if presented with enough evidence</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illinois <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/gov/about/Pages/AbouttheGovernor.aspx">Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official bio] signed into law on Monday a bill to limit detention of immigrants and another to simplify voter registration. The first, Senate Bill 31, also known as the <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/100/SB/PDF/10000SB0031lv.pdf">TRUST Act</a> [text, PDF], limits local local law enforcement's authority in detaining immigrants based on citizenship status. Critics of the bills say this will make Illinois a so-called "sanctuary state" because it contradicts federal law. The TRUST Act will not, however, prevent detention of these individuals when a law enforcement official or agency first obtains a valid federal warrant. The relevant text of the bill states:<blockquote>A law enforcement agency or law enforcement official shall not stop, arrest, search, detain, or continue to detain a person solely based on an individual's citizenship or immigration status. ... This Section 15 does not apply if a law enforcement agency or law enforcement official is presented with a valid, enforceable federal warrant.</blockquote>The second bill, <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/100/SB/PDF/10000SB1933lv.pdf">Senate Bill 1933</a> [text, PDF] amends section 7.5 of the Freedom of Information Act by changing existing sections and adding new provisions. The most dramatic addition is Section 1A-16.1 (a), which was enacted to simplify voter registration. The section permits individuals to automatically renew voter registration, change voter registration address, or decline voter registration or change of address, when the individual obtains or renews a driver's license. An authorized application is then considered a dual-purpose application. Section 1A-16.1 (b) sets forth the dual purpose applications as:<blockquote>If an application, an application for renewal, a change of address form, or a recertification form for a driver's license, other than a temporary visitor's driver's license, or a State identification card issued by the Office of the Secretary of State meets the requirements of the federal REAL ID  Act of  2005, then that application shall serve as a dual-purpose application.</blockquote>Both immigration and voter registration have been focal points for legislatures across the country in recent months. In June the California State Assembly passed <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chicago-sues-trump-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding.php">two bills</a> which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college by preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from entering a school site without a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">valid judicial warrant</a> [JURIST reports] and approval from the superintendent. Also in June Texas Governor Greg Abbott singed into law <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-bill-loosening-voter-id-laws.php">a bill</a> [JURIST report] which allows voters who lack a photo ID to produce <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/abbott-signs-voter-end-straight-party-voting-into-law/5vb95W3p0406a5mRgysEyL/">other documents</a> [Statesmen report] showing their name and address, such as a voter registration certificate, utility bill, government check or bank statement, to verify their identity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/082817zr_5h25.pdf">stayed</a> [order, PDF] a lower federal court order invalidating two congressional districts. The <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/federal-court-invalidates-two-texas-congressional-districts.php">found</a> [JURIST report] Districts 27 and 35 invalid pursuant to the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=43&page=transcript">Fourteenth Amendment</a> of the Constitution [text], after finding that the two districts were drawn with an intention to undermine minority voters. Specifically, judges Smith, Garcia and Rodriguez declared District 27 invalid, concluding that it was drawn to deny Hispanic voters the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, and District 35 invalid after finding that race was a primary factor in the drawing of the district. The lower court had scheduled a hearing to begin the process of redrawing the districts. Texas appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, and this order stays that hearing. This stay order comes <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/08/alito-puts-texas-redistricting-case-hold/">solely from Justice Samuel Alito</a> [SCOTUSblog report], who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-court-order-to-redraw-some-texas-congressional-districts/2017/08/28/d4599674-8486-11e7-b359-15a3617c767b_story.html?utm_term=.83f2746e6109">generally handles emergency appeals</a> [WP report] from Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. The order is only one sentence long and stays the hearing pending a response from the plaintiffs challenging the redistricting, which is due by 3:00 PM on September 5. </p>

<p>Voting rights and how congressional districts are drawn have become increasingly contentious issues over the past few years. In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-wisconsin-partisan-gerrymandering-case.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to hear a Wisconsin gerrymandering case. Earlier the same month, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-affirms-order-finding-north-carolina-racial-gerrymandering.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. In May, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting of Districts 1 and 12 was unconstitutional because the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In January, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. In April 2016, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">unanimously upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human rights groups on Monday filed suits against Jagath Jayasuriya, a former Sri Lanka army general, for alleged war crimes and human rights violations he committed during the 2009 civil war in Sri Lanka. The suits are based on his role as a commander in the Sri Lanka military during the final phase of the government's conflict against the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tamil-Tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [Britannica backgrounder]. The <a href="https://apnews.com/2d561f4eb07b4736a88c420c4af33531/War-crimes-suits-against-Sri-Lankan-ambassador-in-Brazil">suits allege</a> [AP report] that Jayasuriya supervised units that are responsible for the torturing, killing or enforced disappearances of thousands of individuals, including civilians. Carlos Castresana Fernandez, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, stated: "This is one genocide that has been forgotten, but this will force democratic countries to do something ... This is just the beginning of the fight." According to Fernandez, suits have been filed in Brazil and Colombia, and will also be filed in Argentina, Chile and Peru. Fernandez also added that Jayasuriya has reportedly fled Brazil, although this fact could not be confirmed. </p>

<p>The global community has been calling on Sri Lanka to create more accountability, since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. In March the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-chief-urges-international-participation-in-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe.php">presented his report</a> [JURIST report] on Sri Lanka to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] stating that much work remains to make Sri Lanka's judiciary conform with international expectations. In January a panel of the Sri Lanka <a href="http://www.scrm.gov.lk/">Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/sri-lankan-panel-backs-hybrid-courts-for-war-crimes.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that the nation temporarily adopt a hybrid court with both local and international judges working in tandem to adjudicate war crime allegations stemming from the nation's civil war. In May 2016, a UN rights expert said that Sri Lanka was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-expert-sri-lanka-investigators-still-using-torture.php">still torturing suspects</a> [JURIST report] seven years after the conclusion of the civil war. In October the UN Independent Expert on minority issues,  <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/minorities/expert/">Rita Izsák-Ndiaye</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-urges-sri-lanka-to-protect-minorities.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to better protect minorities [JURIST report]. The UN released a report in 2015 finding that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-war-crimes-may-have-been-committed-during-sri-lanka-civil-war.php">war crimes may have been committed</a> [JURIST report] during the war. The UN report came amid mounting pressure from human rights groups and the international community to investigate and prosecute abuses during the conflict with the LTTE. In 2014 then-US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/about/simon-skjodt-center-fellows/ambassador-stephen-j-rapp">Stephen Rapp</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to investigate rights abuses by security forces during the civil war. In 2013 then UK Prime Minister <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Cameron">David Cameron</a> [Britannica profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/britain-pm-demands-independent-sri-lanka-rights-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that Sri Lanka conduct its own investigation into war crime allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-judge panel of the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view.php?pk_id=0000030886">questioned</a> [audio recording] the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration in a hearing over the executive order restricting immigration from certain countries. Popularly known as the "travel ban," the Trump administration policy restricts refugee and general travel from six predominantly-Muslim nations in the stated-interested of national security. Though the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-releases-guidelines-for-travel-ban-implementation.php">defined</a> [JURIST report] what was permissible under the program, there continues to be disagreement between the administration and opponents, including over who has a "close familial relationship" to a US person or "close, documented" ties to a US entity. When government attorney <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-hearing-idUSKCN1B82EJ?il=0">Hashim Mooppan</a> [Reuters report] argued that grandparents should not fall within the scope of close familial relationships, Judge Ronald Gould countered, "what universe does that come from?"</p>

<p>Though claiming to serve the interest of national security, the travel ban has been widely criticized by organizations <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/carrp">such as the ACLU</a> and the <a href="https://www.nwirp.org/">Northwest Immigrant Rights Project</a> [advocacy websites] and has faced legal difficulties in court. In June the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) [official website]. In July, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-expands-travel-ban-exemptions.php">expanded travel ban exemptions</a> [JURIST report], though the Supreme Court later allowed the ban to apply to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/supreme-court-travel-ban-grandparents/index.html">refugees</a> [cnn report]. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear further arguments on the matter in October. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  In a periodic <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/RUS/CERD_C_RUS_CO_23-24_28705_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] published on Friday, the UN's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CERD/Pages/CERDIndex.aspx">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [official website] expressed concern about the racist speech used by politicians and neo-Nazi groups in Russia. According to the report, such speech often targets Central Asians, the Roma, migrants and people of African descent. While the report found that racist violence has decreased, it still remains a problem in sports. The UN also stated that the Russian police continues to profile ethnic minorities, and the Russian media still promotes racist stereotypes. The committee wrote, "Racist hate speech is still used by officials and politicians, especially during election campaigns, and remains unpunished." The committee recommended prosecuting hate speech by both neo-Nazi groups and politicians who use such speech in their campaigns. They also recommended having law enforcement officials undergo anti-racism training.  </p>

<p>Russia's human rights and religious freedom record has been the subject of widespread international criticism. Last month the Russian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/russian-supreme-court-upholds-ruling-banning-jehovahs-witnesses.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a ban on the Jehovah's Witnesses, following the <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-top-court-bans-jehovahs-witnesses.php">initial ruling</a> [JURIST report] in April. In February the Russian Supreme Court annulled the 2.5 year prison sentence of Ildar Dadin, who was the first person to be convicted under a relatively <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-highest-court-releases-political-activist.php">new anti-protest law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in February the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Russia to pay more than 63,000 euros for arresting Alexander Navalny multiple times between March 2012 and February 2014. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-sanctions-five-russian-officials-for-human-rights-abuses.php">sanctioned</a> [JURIST report] five Russian officials for human rights abuses in association with the death of a lawyer in prison. The Russian Foreign Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/russia-announces-intentions-to-leave-icc.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that Russia would leave the International Criminal Court (ICC), expressing disdain over the ICC's investigation into potential human rights abuses by Russian forces in South Ossetia in 2008. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chile's president, <a href="http://michellebachelet.cl/pdf/biography.pdf">Michelle Bachelet</a> [official profile, PDF] introduced a bill on Tuesday that would legalize same-sex marriage. Bachelet <a href="http://www.gob.cl/president-bachelet-chile-is-taking-historic-step-by-signing-the-marriage-equality-bill/">said</a> [press release] "We believe that it is not ethical or just to place artificial limits on love or deny essential rights based solely on the sex of the partners." The marriage bill would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children. The bill must now be approved by Congress. According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, it is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/chiles-bachelet-presents-gay-marriage-bill/2017/08/28/860958ec-8c33-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?utm_term=.30937d0947fa">"unlikely"</a> [WP report] that Congress will approve the bill before Bachelet's term ends next March. However, the presidential support is significant for a country that has historically been viewed as conservative.  </p>

<p>LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. Last month Malta <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/malta-becomes-latest-country-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage. That same month the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/uk-supreme-court-awards-equal-pension-rights-to-same-sex-spouse.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] equal pension rights to same-sex spouses. Earlier in July the New Zealand Parliament formally <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/new-zealand-parliament-apologizes-for-homosexuality-convictions.php">apologized</a> [JURIST report] to the hundreds of men who were criminally convicted under antiquated anti-homosexuality laws. Also in July a Chinese court has ordered a mental hospital to issue a public apology and pay <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/china-court-finds-for-gay-man-in-conversion-therapy-case.php">compensation</a> [JURIST report] to a 38-year-old man after forcing him to undergo conversion therapy. In June the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 393-226 to legalize same-sex marriage. In April Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. A day earlier Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General António Guterres to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenya's <a href="https://www.iebc.or.ke/">Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission</a> [official website] allegedly failed to follow a Supreme Court order on Tuesday requiring the electoral commission to grant the opposition computer access to verify controversial election results. According to Raila Odinga, head of the <a href="https://nasacoalition.com/">National Super Alliance</a> (NASA) [party website], the recently re-elected President Uhuru Kenyatta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/29/world/africa/ap-af-kenya-election-challenge.html?mcubz=1">falsely won 54 percent of the vote</a> [NYT report] due to hacking of the commission's servers. Following a challenge from the opposition, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-top-court-orders-election-commission-to-give-opposition-access-to-vote-count.php">ordered on Monday</a> [JURIST report] that the commission must grant read-only sever access to both NASA and Kenyatta's Jubilee Party. Odinga's spokesman stated, however, that upon request only printed logs from the servers were offered. While the commission has excused the matter as a logistical error, due the request's late time of day, it has been noted that the court order was made during the daytime. Currently, the Supreme Court is set to rule on the matter later Tuesday.</p>

<p>The election has sparked violent protests, <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-protest-of-president-reelection-results-in-death-of-citizens.php">resulting</a> [JURIST report] in at least 24 people dead, according to NASA. UN HIgh Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-chief-urges-kenya-leaders-to-avoid-post-election-violence.php">called on Kenyan leaders</a> [JURIST report] to "take the responsible path and exercise their leadership to avoid violence" after these deadly protests. Protests the following Kenya's 2007 election, which Odinga also lost, resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, triggering an International Criminal Court investigation and charges that were <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">ultimately dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/media_100710.html">voiced</a> [press release] its concerns on Tuesday regarding the lack of drinking water accessible to children in war torn countries. According to UNICEF, more than 180 million people are <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57427#.WaWtspOGORs">cut off</a> [UN News Centre report] from water in countries of conflict including Yemen, Syria and Nigeria. Generally, inhabitants of these countries are four times more likely to lack safe water than people in other countries. In such countries, UNICEF reports that water sources are either contaminated, in disrepair, or even deliberately destroyed as an act of war. <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/media_61432.html">Sanjay Wijesekera</a> [official profile], UICEF's chief of water, sanitation and hygiene, stressed that children's access to safe water must be prioritized and considered a right rather than a privilege. Morevore, Wijesekera noted the consequential rise of malnutrition and fatal diseases such as cholera and acute watery diarrhoea. In countries struck by famine, 14.6 million children urgently require drinkable water, over 5 million are malnourished, and 1.4 million may be considered severe cases. The UN is expected to continue discussing water issues during the ongoing <a href="http://www.unwater.org/world-water-week-in-stockholm-2017/">World Water Week</a> [official website] being held in Stockholm, Sweden. </p>

<p>The international community continues its efforts to protect the rights of children worldwide. Earlier this month, the El Salvador Legislative Assembly unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/el-salvador-drops-portion-of-child-marriage-law.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to eliminate a law that allowed men to marry minors that they had impregnated. Also this month, a group of UN experts for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-philippines-must-address-human-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of the Philippines to address reports of human rights violations that include threats against indigenous people, murder and the summary execution of children. Last month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/rights-group-calls-on-us-to-end-surgeries-on-intersex-children.php">issued an expansive report</a> [JURIST report] calling for a "moratorium" on surgeries designed to "normalize" intersex children, those who are "are born with chromosomes, gonads, sex organs, or genitalia that differ from those seen as socially typical for boys and girls." HRW also stated in June that millions of pregnant and married girls across Africa are being <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/human-rights-watch-pregnant-and-married-african-girls-denied-education.php">denied education due to discriminatory policies</a> [JURIST report]. In March, UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/unicef-calls-for-protection-of-migrant-women-in-children-on-the-mediterranean-route.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] an increased risk of abuse of migrant women and children along the central Mediterranean trade route.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/29/urgent-need-independent-international-inquiry-yemen">open letter</a>[text] addressed to representatives of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/CurrentMembers.aspx">Member and Observer States</a> [materials] of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">United Nations Humans Rights Council</a> [official website], 56 national, regional and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) called for an "independent, international inquiry" into violations of human rights in <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/yemen">Yemen</a> [OHCHR profile]. The letter refers to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21996&LangID=E">reports</a> [materials] from September 2015 and September 2016, which address the increasing violence between Saudi Arabia-backed supporters of exiled President Hadi, and the Houthi governement led by President Saleh, which took control of the capital of Sana'a in late 2014. The letter address violence from both sides of the conflict, and calls for the creation of an independent inquiry into the matter, claiming "[t]he victims of abuses in Yemen cannot afford to wait longer for credible investigations into ongoing grave violations and abuses to be undertaken."<blockquote>Parties to the conflict are recruiting and deploying child soldiers. Both sides have used widely banned weapons that can endanger civilians long after a conflict ends. The Saudi-led coalition has used at least seven types of cluster munitions, and the Houthi-Saleh side has laid antipersonnel landmines in a number of Yemeni governorates.</blockquote>The state of human rights in Yemen is rapidly deteriorating since October, when UN rights expert Heiner Bielefeldt <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-yemen-must-stop-harassment-of-religious-community.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Yemen for detaining individuals belonging to the religious community. In June the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/hrw-accuses-uae-of-supporting-human-rights-abuses-in-yemen.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/united-arab-emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> [HRW profile] of backing "Yemeni forces that have arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and abused dozens of people during security operations." In May, UN expert on freedom of religion Ahmed Shaheed <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-freedom-of-religion-expert-urges-yemen-to-stop-persecution-of-bahai-community.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Houthi de facto authorities in Yemen must end harassment against the <a href="http://www.bahai.org/">Bahá'í</a> [official website] community in the Yemen capital, Sana'a. In April the Public Prosecutor summoned 30 Bahá'í community members to appear in court and the Houthi de facto authorities ordered the arrest of 25 members. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein reported that more than 13,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the last two years and more than 80 percent of the population are in need of humanitarian assistance, in his March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-right-chief-calls-for-a-cease-fire-in-yemen.php">statement calling for an immediate ceasefire </a>[JURIST report] in the Yemen war and continued international support in ending the conflict. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S234148A.PDF">5-2 ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that will make it easier for the state to get tax propositions on ballots. The court's ruling relied on its interpretation of <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/1996/120196_prop_218/understanding_prop218_1296.html">Proposition 218</a> [materials], a constitutional initiative approved by California voters in 1996 that was intended to assure that all taxes on Californian tax payers would have to gain a two-thirds voter approval before going into effect. The ruling will now limit this two-third requirement to tax proposals introduced by city and county-level governments, while initiatives introduced by citizens would only require a simple majority. Some anti-tax groups have <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california/articles/2017-08-29/the-latest-ruling-could-make-tax-measures-easier-to-pass">stated</a> [AP report] that the ruling will lead to an increase in local taxation within the state while legal experts said that Monday's ruling was too narrow to have such a significant effect on local taxation. </p>

<p>This lawsuit <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/CA-Supreme-Court-makes-it-a-bit-easier-for-tax-12112661.php">was originally filed</a> [SFGate report] by the <a href="www.californiacannabiscoalition.org/<br />
www.californiacannabiscoalition.org/<br />
www.californiacannabiscoalition.org/<br />
http://www.californiacannabiscoalition.org">California Cannabis Coalition</a> (CCC) [advocacy website] against the city of Upland in San Bernardino County. The CCC introduced a ballot initiative in 2014 that would have repealed an ordinance in Upland which banned medical marijuana dispensaries. The CCC initiative would have laid out the standard by which citizens could open a dispensary. After obtaining the required signatures of 15 percent of the city's population, California law compelled the local government to either adopt the initiative or put it on the ballot for the next general election. The city then imposed a $15,000 licensing fee for these dispensaries and argued that the additional fees proposed by the CCC were a general tax and therefore had to gain two-thirds voter approval. Monday's ruling will ensure that all future general taxes introduced by citizen organizations such as the CCC will only require a simple majority to pass and go into effect. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Multiple UN experts on Tuesday <a href="https://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/793566CDC152060EC125818B0038C673?OpenDocument">urged</a> [press release] all member states to ratify the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/disappearance-convention.pdf">International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance</a> [text, PDF] as the rates of enforced disappearances are increasing in multiple countries in every region around the world. The experts argued that in today's political climate, it is unacceptable that enforced disappearances, a wide-spread practice in which persons are secretly abducted or even imprisoned by state actors or third parties acting with the government's support, continue to transpire on every continent. They further argued that the convention would put in place many legal changes which will reduce and prevent enforced disappearances. Among these changes is a requirement to hold individuals "deprived of their liberty" in detention centers which are officially recognized. Additionally, the convention would require the government to acknowledge the identity of all such persons to the general public. The experts also argued that member states should begin to aid and enable human right workers who are currently combating the issue of enforced disappearances. </p>

<p>While enforced disappearance has been a worldwide problem, the most well-documented recent case of disappearance took place in Mexico in 2014. In 2016, a panel of experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mexico-government-hampered-probe-into-missing-students-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its second and last report on its inquiry into the 43 undergraduate students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa who went missing in Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico, in 2014, stating that the Mexican government has hampered the investigation. In January 2016 three men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mexico-authorities-arrest-3-suspects-in-missing-43-investigation.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] for their possible connection to the disappearance as part of the government's story. In November 2015 Mexico's own National Human Rights Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/mexico-commission-criticizes-ag-for-missing-43-investigation.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Mexican Attorney General's Office and other government offices involved in the investigation for failing to comply with its recommendations. In October 2015 Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hrw-evidence-of-unlawful-police-killings-in-mexico.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that there was evidence of unlawful police killing in the country. Also, in October 2015 Mexican Attorney General Arely Gómez González r<a href="/paperchase/2015/10/mexicos-attorney-general-releases-case-file-on-missing-students.php">eleased</a> [JURIST report] a 54,000 page file detailing the Mexican government's investigation. This will be the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-calls-on-all-governments-to-stop-enforced-disappearances.php">second time</a> [JURIST report] that UN affiliates have called on all governments to make a concerted effort to fight against enforced disappearances. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22004&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] people to refrain from violence against Myanmar security forces, for authorities to adhere to human rights law, and for authorities to prohibit use of provocative media usage in the northern regions of Rakhine state. According to Zeid, the acts of violence committed in northern Rakhine against Myanmar security forces could have been "predicted and could have been prevented" due to "decades of persistent and systematic human rights violations [which] have almost certainly contributed to the nurturing of violent extremism." Allegations by the State Counselor's Office insinuate that international aid workers help or support the violence, which, according to Zeid, "place [international aid organizations'] staff in danger and may make it impossible for them to deliver essential aid." In order to ensure that security forces adhere to human right laws, Zeid implore state authorities to instruct them to "refrain from using disproportionate force, minimize damage and injuries, and respect the right to life." According to Zeid, since the outbreak of violence in northern Rakhine in October 2016, thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, with as many as 5,200 fleeing just last week.</p>

<p>Human rights has been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. In November the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-experts-urge-myanmar-to-address-concerns-in-northern-rakhine-state.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar government to take immediate action in addressing human rights and humanitarian concerns in the northern part of the Rakhine state. In February UN Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-myanmar-violence-in-rakhine-could-be-crimes-against-humanity.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state could amount to crimes against humanity. In March the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-investigate-abuses-in-myanmar.php">passed a resolution to investigate</a> [JURIST report] potential human rights violations in Myanmar. However, in August the Myanmar government <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/myanmar-government-inquiry-finds-no-crimes-against-humanity-in-rakhine-violence.php">found</a> [JURIST report]  no crimes against humanity were committed during the violence in Rakhine last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former prison nurse Jesse Vroegh <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/357456899/Jesse-Vroegh-lawsuit">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint] in Polk County District Court on Monday under the <a href="https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=IowaCode&ga=83&input=216.#216.6A">Iowa Civil Rights Act</a> [text, Ch. 216] and equal protection clause of <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/ICNST/780453.pdf">Iowa Constitution</a> [text, Art. I, Section 6] claiming the Iowa's Department of Corrections (DOC) discriminated against him due to his transgender identity. Vroegh claims he was denied access to men's restrooms, men's lockers rooms, and health care coverage for a "medically necessary surgery" despite the fact that the DOC offers similar surgery for non-transgender employees. According to the American Civil Liberties of Iowa, which filed the lawsuit on Vroegh's behalf, this is the first transgender rights suit filed since the Iowa Civil Rights Act was amended in 2007 to include gender identity and sexual orientation. Vroegh had originally filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/vroegh_stamped_icrc_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission claiming discrimination in July 2016. In April, however, the Commission responded that it was "too controversial" to allow Vroegh into male restrooms inciting him to file the current lawsuit. Vroegh was required to use a unisex, private restroom, which isolated him from his coworkers and did not provide him with shower access, after he spent years transitioning from female to male. Vroegh argues that the DOC cannot require employees to use private restrooms based on their gender identity and is seeking damages for emotional distress and injunctive relief to prevent further discriminatory policies in the DOC.</p>

<p>Transgender rights have been an controversial topic in the US. In August US President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-formally-issues-ban-on-transgender-military-service.php">directed</a> [JURIST report] the Secretaries of the <a href="http://https://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DoD) [official website] and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] to continue policies banning transgender individuals from military service. In February the Trump administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] the Obama-era guidelines requiring federally funded schools to treat gender identity as a student's sex for purposes of Title IX. In March the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-sends-transgender-bathroom-case-back-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a>[JURIST report] a lower court ruling in <em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gloucester-county-school-board-v-g-g/">Gloucester County School Board v. G.G.</a></em> [SCOTUSblog materials], which concerns transgender restroom policies in school, after the rescission of the guidelines requiring school districts to permit students to the restroom of their choice in February. In May the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-transgender-student-on-bathroom-policy.php">affirmed an order</a>[JURIST report] allowing a transgender male student to use the boy's restroom. In May a Mississippi man was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/mississipi-man-sentenced-in-first-us-transgender-hate-crime-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 49 years in prison in the first-ever conviction for a transgender hate crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Nevada homeowner on Monday <a href="https://dlbjbjzgnk95t.cloudfront.net/0958000/958814/https-ecf-cand-uscourts-gov-doc1-035115823505.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo & Co</a> [corporate website] in a San Francisco federal court accusing the bank of falsely charging consumers certain mortgage fees. Borrowers applying for mortgages must usually pay a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-mortgages-lawsuit-idUSKCN1B91VD">rate-lock extension fee</a> [Reuters report] to set a promised interest rate beyond a certain time period when there has been a delay in the approval process. Customarily, Wells Fargo waives such extra fees when the fault can be attributed to their own staff. According to the suit, however, Wells Fargo has been blaming borrowers for delays and applying fees even though the delays were the result of understaffing. Such practice would potentially be in violation of the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title12/chapter27&edition=prelim">US Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act</a> and the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapter1&edition=prelim">US Truth in Lending Act</a> [texts]. The plaintiff currently intends to request the court for class action status in the matter. The newly filed suit follows public disclosure, made earlier this month, that the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) [official website] is currently investigating Wells Fargo to determine whether consumers have been harmed by falsely charged rate-lock extension fees. </p>

<p>The CFPB has been part of legal headlines over the last year. In July the CFPB  <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/us-consumer-agency-moves-to-ban-mandatory-arbitration.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a new rule banning mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer agreements. In February the New York Attorney General and the CFPB filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/legal-advance-company-accused-of-scamming-911-first-responders-nfl-players.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against RD Legal Funding, LLC and founder/owner Roni Dersovitz for allegedly scamming 9/11 first responders and NFL concussion victims out of money intended to cover medical costs, lost income and other critical personal needs. In January the CFPB initiated a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/largest-servicer-of-us-student-loans-facing-lawsuits.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against Navient, the largest servicer of US student loans. In September the CFPB <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/consumer-agency-fines-wells-fargo-us-100-million.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a $100 million fine against banking giant Wells Fargo for widespread illegal sales practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> [corporate website] confirmed on Tuesday that they are currently under investigation by the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] for bribing foreign officials. The DOJ is seeking to determine whether Uber operated in violation of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-fraud/legacy/2012/11/14/fcpa-english.pdf">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> [text, PDF] over the course of the company's rapid expansion into foreign countries. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the bribing of foreign officials as well as having an intent to bribe said officials. It is not clear which countries were the subject of the alleged bribes or what type of bribes were offered by Uber. </p>

<p>Uber has faced a number of legal battles over its technology and organization after its recent rise to prominence. Since their inception, ride-sharing services like Uber have been among the <a href="/feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">most controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. In May a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-uber-engineer-removed-from-project-in-waymo-suit.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the removal of an Uber engineer from the self-driving division of the company. The engineer in controversy may have stolen information from the self-driving company <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a> [corporate website] prior to his employment by Uber. Earlier in May the European Court of Justice (ECJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a non-binding opinion finding that Uber is a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. Also in May the (DOJ) announced it had <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/reuters-doj-conducting-criminal-investigation-of-uber-for-avoiding-law-enforcement.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation into Uber for the use of a software tool that helped drivers evade local transport regulators. The US Federal Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/uber-ordered-to-pay-20-million-for-misleading-recruitment-information.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in January that Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle a claim that the ride-hailing company had engaged in misleading tactics to recruit new drivers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Leaders/Secretary-of-Defense/">Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis</a> [official website] on Tuesday released a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1294351/">statement</a> [press release] declaring that a panel will be established to determine how to implement President Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/25/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-and-secretary-homeland">"Military and Service by Transgender Individuals" Presidential Memorandum</a> [text] and that all currently serving members of the military will remain serving under the current policy until the panel has provided a report of its recommendations. The panel will include experts from with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The implementation plan will "promote military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion, with due regard for budgetary constraints and consistent with applicable law." Once Mattis receives the report, he will consult with the secretary of Homeland Security, followed by providing recommendations to Trump. Mattis will also be providing interim guidance regarding the memorandum "to ensure the continued combat readiness of the force."</p>

<p>Last week Trump formally <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-formally-issues-ban-on-transgender-military-service.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a memorandum to ban transgender individuals serving in the US military. In addition to the ban, Trump also prohibited the use of military resources funding sex reassignment surgical procedures for military members except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex. On Monday lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/two-lawsuits-filed-challenging-trumps-transgender-military-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] against the transgender military ban by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN</a> [Official websites], declaring that the ban violated the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The previous ban on transgender military service was <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ban-on-transgender-service-members-lifted.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] last July under then-president Barack Obama, reversing a long-standing policy that prevented transgender persons from serving in the military and made a transgender identity grounds for discharge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US grand jury <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/08/29/turkish.embassy.case.-.indictment.-.aug..29,.2017.pdf">indicted 19 people</a> [text, PDF], including 15 Turkish security officials, on Tuesday for attacking protesters during a visit to the White House by the Turkish <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/">President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a> [official website] in May. The protesters gathered outside of the Turkish ambassador's home after he met with US President Donald Trump and were attacked by the 19 defendants. All are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/19-indicted-for-attacking-protesters-during-erdogan-us-visit/2017/08/29/2de650a4-8d17-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?utm_term=.19f9ac78916f">charged</a> [AP report] with conspiracy to commit a crime of violence, and several others face additional charges of assault with a deadly weapon. It is unclear whether members of Erdoğan's security detail who returned with him to Turkey will face legal repercussions in the US.</p>

<p>The May disturbance further strained US-Turkey relations. The two countries have clashed over the US decision to provide weapons to Syrian Kurdish rebels fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Turkey considers the fighters to be an extension the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey, known as the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100">Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)</a> [BBC backgrounder], which has been deemed an illegal terrorist organization by the Turkish government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx"> Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] said Wednesday that US President Donald Trump's constant criticism of journalists constitutes an attack on the freedom of the press. "It's really quite amazing when you think that freedom of the press, not only sort of a cornerstone of the U.S. Constitution but very much something that the United States defended over the years is now itself under attack from the President." Specifically referring to Trump's "fake news" criticism, Zeid claimed that such criticism does damage not only to the news organizations as a whole but also to the individual journalists. The High Commissioner was also concerned that the rampant criticism of journalists could ultimately incite violence against the journalists in the US. The White House did not respond to Zeid's comments about Trump's alleged attack on the freedom of the press. </p>

<p>Trump's presidency has been riddled with controversy since his inauguration in January. Earlier this week a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/ninth-circuit-questions-necessity-of-travel-ban.php">questioned</a> [JURIST report] a Justice Department lawyer in a hearing regarding Trump's controversial travel ban. Also this week two separate lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/two-lawsuits-filed-challenging-trumps-transgender-military-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] challenging Trump's recent decision to reinstate a ban prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the US military. In July two Democratic lawmakers <a href="g/paperchase/2017/07/democratic-lawmakers-file-article-of-impeachment-for-trump.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an article of impeachment against Trump accusing him of an obstruction of justice regarding the Russia probe. Days earlier in July a group of Twitter users <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/twitter-users-blocked-by-trump-sue-for-first-amendment-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Trump for a violation of their First Amendment rights after they were blocked by Trump on Twitter. In June former FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/former-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-against-trump-administration.php">testified against the Trump administration</a> [JURIST report] after he was fired from his position by Trump. In May Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-fbi-director-mueller-appointed-as-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation.php">appointed as special counsel</a> [JURIST report] to lead the investigation regarding Russia's involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Guatemalan Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmymoralesgt?lang=en">President Jimmy Morales'</a> [official twitter] order to deport the head of a UN anti-corruption commission from the country. The order came from the president two days after Ivan Velasquez, the Colombian prosecutor who leads <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">Guatemala's International Commission against Impunity</a> [official website], announced his pursuit to lift Morales' immunity from prosecution in order to investigate alleged illegal campaign financing. The Supreme Court quickly halted the deportation, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uns-guterres-reiterates-support-envoy-guatemala-49493265">stating</a> [AP report] that the order was issued improperly. The UN stated that it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-corruption-court-idUSKCN1B92VE">disturbed</a> [Reuters report] by Morales' actions against Velasquez. Citizens, in protest of Morales, declared a state of siege in the capital, and the <a href="https://gt.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/our-ambassador/">US ambassador to Guatemala Todd Robinson</a> [official website] stated that the president's moves could put at risk a US development plan in Central America to reduce poverty and crime.</p>

<p>Guatemala has a history of political scandal. Former president Otto Pérez Molina and ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti were <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/guatemala-ex-president-accused-of-corruption.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of taking nearly 130 million in bribes in the beginning of 2011 by Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana. In August 2015 the Guatemalan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach Molina after he announced his intent to not resign after the scandal broke. In October, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] welcomed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-office-welcomes-new-guatemalan-draft-bill-on-constitutional-justice-r.php">draft bill </a>[JURIST report] on constitutional justice reforms in the Guatemala legislature, which "represents an historic opportunity to consolidate the remarkable progress the country has achieved in the fight against impunity and corruption in recent years." In June a Guatemalan judge who served as general secretary for Guatemala's soccer federation <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/guatemala-judge-pleads-guilty-in-fifa-fraud-case.php">pled guilty</a> [JURIST report] to fraud and conspiracy in the FIFA scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly on Tuesday <a href="http://minci.gob.ve/2017/08/anc-decreto-bloqueo-economico-eeuu/">approved</a> [press release, in Spanish] a decree rejecting the US economic sanctions and called for treason investigations into political actors for supporting the sanctions. The decree was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41091745">passed unanimously</a> [BBC report by the ANC. During the debate of the decree, members of the ANC denounced those who were critical of the government, including opposition party members and former supporters of the socialist government. Julio Borges, head of the opposition-controlled parliament, was accused of asking Goldman Sachs to stop buying Venezuelan bonds. The decree came in response to new sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump's <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13808.php">executive order</a> [text] on Friday. </p>

<p>Venezuela has experienced a significant amount of political unrest since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly in December 2015. In July Venezuelans voted to <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">reject</a> [JURIST report] a plan to rewrite the country's constitution in a non-binding referendum. Earlier this month the ANC <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuela-constituent-assembly-creates-truth-commission.php">created</a> [JURIST report] a Commission for Truth, Justice and Public Legitimacy, which critics claimed would be used to silence opposition. Also in August the US Treasury Department <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/us-treasury-department-imposes-sanctions-on-venezuela-president.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In May the US Department of the Treasury <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-announces-sanctions-against-venezuela-supreme-court-justices.php">announced sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/VE/HCReportVenezuela_1April-31July2017_EN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on Wednesday highlighting the human rights violations abuses that have been committed in Venezuela amid this year's anti-government protests. Since the beginning of April, the Attorney General has reportedly <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22007&LangID=E">initiated</a> [press release] at least 1,958 investigations into reported injuries occurring during protests, with such injuries increasing in severity as months have passed. More than 5,000 protestors have been detained since April, with 1,000 people still detained as of the end of July. The UN has also reported 124 deaths, with 46 attributed to government forces and 27 to pro-government armed forces called colectivos. In light of overwhelming reports of violence against civilians, political opponents, and media workers, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/profiles/zeid-ra%E2%80%99ad-al-hussein">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] has called on the UN and Venezuela to take further measures to prevent human rights violations in the country. According to Hussein, evidence of systematic excessive force, detentions, torture and the silencing of political dissent indicate that Venezuelans' rights and freedoms are being violated. Zeid has stressed the importance of properly and impartially reporting human rights abuses, scaling back detentions, and reducing the country's state of violence and political tension. </p>

<p>Venezuela has been going through significant political unrest between the government and anti-government opposition recently. Earlier this month Venezuela's new chief prosecutor announced <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuela-chief-prosecutor-announces-plans-to-jail-protest-leaders.php">plans</a> [JURIST report] to pursue and imprison those responsible for leading violent protests. Also this month, Venezuela's Constituent Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuela-constituent-assembly-creates-truth-commission.php">created</a> [JURIST report] a Commission for Truth, Justice and Public Legitimacy that will be able to strip the public duties from those that are found to have acted in the protests. Also in August the Venezuela Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/venezuelan-government-cracks-down-on-opposition-amid-uns-calls-to-cease-violence-against-protestors-.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] and removal of the mayor of Chacao, Ramon Muchacho. Muchacho was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he refused to take down barricades set up during anti-government demonstrations. In July violent protests <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-controversial-election-results-in-deadly-protests.php">erupted</a> [JURIST report] after a controversial election for a new assembly that would have the power to rewrite the nation's constitution. Earlier in July Venezuela's opposition party <a href="paperchase/2017/07/venezuelas-opposition-party-calls-for-two-day-strike.php">made a call</a> [JURIST report] for a 48-hour general strike to be held in response to the scheduled election. A <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/millions-of-venezuelans-vote-to-reject-plan-for-contitutional-rewrite.php">non-binding referendum vote</a> [JURIST report] was held in Venezuela earlier in July in regards to the proposed new constitution which showed that 98 percent of the voters rejected the new constitution. The vote was boycotted by many government supporters. In May the National Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge in Brazil issued a <a href="http://portal.trf1.jus.br/lumis/portal/file/fileDownload.jsp?fileId=2C9082505BE5F3E4015E2F62DA6547E1">ruling</a> [text, PDF, in Portuguese] Wednesday that temporarily <a href="http://portal.trf1.jus.br/sjdf/comunicacao-social/imprensa/noticias/justica-federal-suspende-atos-administrativos-que-pretendem-extinguir-a-reserva-nacional-do-cobre-e-associados.htm">blocks an executive order</a> [press release, in Portuguese] from <a href="http://www2.planalto.gov.br/">President Michel Temer</a> [official website, in Portuguese] that would have opened large sections of the Amazon forest for mining. Temer's <a href="http://www2.planalto.gov.br/acompanhe-planalto/noticias/2017/08/decreto-nao-extingue-nenhuma-reserva-ambiental-da-amazonia">order</a> [materials, in Portuguese] would have allowed mining of gold, copper, iron and other minerals and metals in the Renca area of the Amazon, which covers more than 17,000 square miles and has been protected by an Act of Congress since 1984. The order was met with widespread criticism from conservationists and celebrities, including supermodel Gisele Bündchen, who has been an <a href="https://twitter.com/giseleofficial/status/900722737748090883">outspoken critic</a> [Twitter post] of Amazon deforestation. <a href="http://www.agu.gov.br/">Attorney General Grace Mendonça</a> [official website, in Portuguese] has appealed the ruling. </p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times as former president Dilma Rousseff was impeached for <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">corruption</a> [JURIST report] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In May the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/brazil-top-court-authorizes-corruption-probe-into-president-temer.php">authorized</a> [JURIST report] a corruption probe into President Temer and his alleged involvement with the bribery of a potential witness in a major corruption case. A month earlier Brazil's Supreme Court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations into eight cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. The investigation was ordered on the tails of an anti-corruption measure that was passed last December by the Brazilian Lower Chamber of Deputies. <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/brazil-lawmakers-pass-anti-corruption-law-with-controversial-changes.php">"Operation Carwash"</a> [JURIST report] allows individuals who are subject to prosecution to seek criminal consequences against their prosecutors and judges if the officials abuse their powers. "Operation Carwash" was passed as charges have been filed against some of Brazil's most powerful politicians, including former president <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two human rights experts with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22008&LangID=E">statement</a> [press release] Wednesday detailing their concern over websites, including many news sites, that have been shutdown or blocked by the Egyptian government. According to the report, as many as 130 sites have been blocked, "including well-known sources of information as <a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en">MadaMasr</a>, <a href="http://rassd.com/">RASSD</a>, <a href="http://www.elwatannews.com/">Al Watan</a> and <a href="http://www.huffpostarabi.com/">Huffpost Arabi</a>, as well as the websites of human rights organizations such as <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">Reporters without Borders</a>, the <a href="http://anhri.net/?lang=en">Arabic Network for Human Rights Information</a>, and the <a href="https://www.alkarama.org/en">Alkarama Foundation</a> [official websites]." Egyptian authorities have responded to the criticism, claiming the limitations are <a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2017/06/21/feature/politics/egyptian-government-bypasses-isps-to-block-access-to-websites-telecommunications-ministry-source/">necessary to combat terrorism</a> [<em>Madamasr</em> report]. David Kaye and Fionnuala Ní Aloáin, the authors of the OHCHR report, say the widespread shutdown of sites is an overreaction by Egyptian authorities.<blockquote>Limiting information as the Egyptian Government has done, without any transparency or identification of the asserted "lies" or "terrorism", looks more like repression than counter-terrorism. ... In the case of the widespread blockings in Egypt, the blockings appear based on overbroad counter-terrorism legislation, and they lack any form of transparency and have extremely limited, if any, judicial control.</blockquote>The <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] sparked a string of legal proceedings, many of which are still playing out. Last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/egypt-criminal-court-sentences-43-protesters-to-life.php">sentenced 43 individuals to life</a> [JURIST report] in prison for crimes of vandalism, rioting and attacking Egyptian authorities. In April a Cairo criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-court-sentences-muslim-brotherhood-leader-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder] leader Wagdy Ghoneim to death, in absentia. In March former President Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/egypt-former-president-hosni-mubarak-released-from-prison.php">released</a> from prison after six years in custody after he was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/top-egypt-court-acquits-ex-president-mubarak-of-2011-killings.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST reports] in a retrial of charges that he killed protesters during the civil uprising in 2011 that ended his 30-year reign. In January Egyptian activist and youth leader Ahmed Maher, known for his role in the 2011 revolution against the former president, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/egypt-activist-released-from-prison.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from prison following his arrest in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan anti-terrorism court declared former president and army general <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pervez-Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [Britannica profile] a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-bhutto-idUSKCN1BB1FQ">fugitive from the law</a> [Reuters report] on Thursday concerning the assassination of former prime minister, and first female leader in the Muslim world, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benazir-Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> [Britannica profile]. The court further ordered the seizure of Musharaf's property in Pakistan and acquitted five members of the Pakistan wing of Taliban for lack of evidence of their involvement in the assassination. However, Khawaja Mohammad Imtiaz, the special prosecutor for the Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency, expressed his surprise at the acquittal, adding that three of the five men confessed to their roles in the assassination. Additionally, the court found a police officer guilty of mishandling security and another officer guilty of tampering with the crime scene. Specifically, Imtiaz said that one officer oversaw "a deliberate security lapse," while the other washed away the crime scene within two hours of the assassination and also delayed the post mortem. Both officers have been sentenced to 17 years in prison <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/musharraf-declared-fugitive-pm-bhutto-murder-170831104648138.html">and a fine</a> [Al Jazeera report] of PKR 500,000 or US $4,700. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the current leader of the slain Bhutto&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> [official website] called the release of the five individuals "dangerous" and "unacceptable," while Bhutto's daughter Aseefa Zardari stated in a tweet: "There will be no justice till Pervez Musharraf answers for his crimes!" </p>

<p>Musharraf has been actively pursued by Pakistan authorities for a number of years now. Musharraf was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/08/20138204584024869.html">indicted in August 2013</a> [Al Jazeera report] for his involvement in Bhutto's assassination, but was allowed to leave the country for health reasons in 2016, and has been in self-imposed exile ever since in Dubai. In March 2013, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. In August 2011, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] seizure of Musharraf's property and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011, Pakistan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Musharraf but were unable to serve the warrant because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after investigations <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Forces fighting <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/18/isil-threat-explained.html">Islamic State</a> (IS) [Al Jazeera backgrounder] insurgents to regain lost territory in Syria must not sacrifice lives of civilians still trapped in the areas, UN High Commissioner <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/profiles/zeid-ra%E2%80%99ad-al-hussein">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22015&LangID=E">stated</a> [UN press release] Thursday. Zeid had also previously <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-syria-civilians-must-be-protected-from-airstrikes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] in May that civilians needed to be protected from airstrikes in Syria. According to Coalition report figures, from August 1 to August 29 the Coalition conducted 1,094 airstrikes on and near Raqqa city. This is a drastic rise from the 645 reported in July. There have been various reports of civilian deaths from many of these airstrikes in August. The High Commissioner professed his concern that the purpose of underlying the defeat of IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is ultimately the protection and well-being of civilians in the country.<blockquote>I am extremely concerned that in its conduct of hostilities, the attacking forces may be failing to abide by the international humanitarian law principles of precautions, distinction, and proportionality. Meanwhile ISIL fighters continue to prevent civilians from fleeing the area, although some manage to leave after paying large amounts of money to smugglers. We have reports of smugglers also being publicly executed by ISIL. So as airstrikes bombard Al-Raqqa, some 20,000 civilians are either trapped, or risk their lives to flee and end up confined in makeshift camps in areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces under horrendous conditions until prolonged security procedures are completed, with no oversight on how they are treated and screened.</blockquote>There continues to be reports on forcible conscription of civilians by ISIL, while the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has verified that at least 151 deaths have occurred since August 1. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact on the country. Earlier this week UNICEF<a href="/paperchase/2017/08/unicef-children-in-war-torn-countries-have-right-to-safe-water.php"> voiced</a> [JURIST report] its concern that children in war-torn countries, including Syria, have a lack of safe drinking water. Earlier in May the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/house-passes-bill-to-impose-sanctions-on-assad-supporters.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to impose sanctions on supporters of Syria's Assad regime. The same month Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported new evidence that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in at least <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-syria-used-chemical-weapons-in-multiple-attacks.php">four recent attacks</a> [JURIST report] targeting civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kyrgyzstan's <a href="http://jogorku.sot.kg/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Kyrgyz] on Thursday upheld the rejection of a petition to put opposition leader Omurbek Tekebaev on the ballot for the October presidential election. Tekebaev was <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyz-tekebaev-court-upholds-rejection-signatures/28706986.html">convicted</a> [RFE/RL report] earlier this month for accepting bribes, which his party believes is a false conviction by the ruling party. He is currently serving eight years in prison. Although the petition collected about 39,000 signatures (9,000 more than required), the Central Election Commission said the signatures were invalid because the petition was not financed by Tekebaev's election fund.  </p>

<p>In December Kyrgzystan <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/kyrgyzstan-votes-to-amend-constitution-to-increase-government-power.php">voted</a> to amend the constitution to increase government power after the Kyrgyzstan Supreme Court in September <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kyrgyzstan-seeks-to-boost-prime-minister-powers-through-upcoming-referendum.php">voted</a> [JURIST reports] in favor of holding a constitutional referendum that would give more power to the country's prime minister. In January 2016 a spokesperson for the Kyrgyzstan government <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kyrgyzstan-considering-leglsiation-allowing-government-to-shut-down-media-outlets.php">discussed</a> [JURIST report] with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty proposed legislation that would allow the Kyrgyz government to shut down media outlets without requiring a court decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/home.html">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9b3ef2e2-8c9a-466e-92c1-bcf9d62a1d58/2/doc/15-1890_complete_opn.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a former West Point cadet's lawsuit  alleging that superior officers violated her rights when she was allegedly raped by a fellow cadet. Plaintiff Jane Doe alleged that her Fifth Amendment right to equal protection was violated. In a 2-1 opinion, the court concluded that "adjudicating Doe's claim would require judicial interference into a wide range of military function, triggering the incident-to-service rule..." The dissent, written by Judge Denny Chin, disagreed with the majority's use of prior doctrine to bar Doe's claims. "While West Point is indeed a military facility, it is quintessentially an educational institution. ... [S]he was engaged in purely recreational activity. ... [S]he was a student attending college. ... There was 'nothing characteristically military' about what she was doing, and her injuries did not arise out of military employment." Plaintiff's counsel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/nyregion/west-point-cadet-lawsuit.html?mcubz=0">has said</a> [NYT report] her client is considering her future legal options in this case.</p>

<p>Constitutional rights of service members have been a hot topic in the US recently. Earlier this month civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/two-lawsuits-filed-challenging-trumps-transgender-military-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] two separate lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the US military. The same week Trump formally <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-formally-issues-ban-on-transgender-military-service.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] the ban on transgender individuals serving in the US military. In addition to the ban, Trump also prohibited the use of military resources funding sex reassignment surgical procedures for military members except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex. Also in August five unnamed transgender military service members <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/transgender-servicemembers-sue-trump-administration-over-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against President Donald Trump and various officials in his administration, claiming the president's declaration on Twitter that transgender individuals would no longer be accepted or allowed to serve in the military violated the Due Process and Equal Protection components of the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's <a href="http://www.coj.go.th/en/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday cleared former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13298394">Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [BBC bio] and his then-deputy Suthep Thaugsuban of murder and attempted murder during a crackdown in 2010 on anti-government protesters. More than 90 people were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-court-vejjajiva-idUSKCN1BB0X5">killed</a> [Reuters report] during the crackdown. The court <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1316327/abhisit-suthep-cleared-for-2010-crackdown-on-red-shirts">affirmed</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] the two lower courts' decision that the Department for Special Investigation, which brought the case, did not have sufficient jurisdiction. The Supreme Court said that any proceedings must be filed with the <a href="https://www.nacc.go.th/main.php?filename=index_en">National Anti-Corruption Commission</a> [official website].  </p>

<p>This decision follows the <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/former-thai-prime-ministers-acquitted-of-abuse-of-power.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] of two other prime ministers earlier this month for a similar crackdown on protesters in 2008. Last week another former prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/thailand-ex-pm-flees-country-ahead-of-verdict-reports.php">fled the country</a> [JURIST report] before facing a verdict on her corruption charges. Also in August a Thai activist was <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/thailand-activist-imprisoned-for-sharing-bbc-article-about-countrys-king.php">imprisoned</a> or sharing a BBC article about the country's king, and a prominent Thai journalist was <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/prominent-thailand-journalist-charged-with-sedition.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] with sedition.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Texas on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/Texas%20Sanctuary%20Cities%20Temporary%20Injunction%20order.pdf">temporarily blocked</a> [order, PDF] the implementation and enforcement of Texas <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004I.pdf">Senate Bill 4</a> (SB4) [text, PDF], which sought to ban so-called "sanctuary cities." Judge Orlando Garcia enjoined the state of Texas from enforcing, endorsing or otherwise implementing various sections of SB4 that would have prohibited local agencies from enforcing policies that bar officers from inquiring as to an individual's immigration status even during routine traffic stops. Some of these provisions also provide for fines or discipline such as "removal from office" against local officials who refuse to or otherwise fail to cooperate with federal immigration officials. Texas <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Ken Paxton</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-vows-to-defend-the-constitutionality-of-senate-bill-4">statement</a> [press release] vowing to appeal the ruling, joining <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a>'s [official website] own calls for appeal. American Civil Liberties Union Deputy Director of Immigrants' Rights Project, Lee Gelernt, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-strikes-down-virtually-all-texas-anti-immigrant-senate-bill-4">welcomed the order</a> [ACLU press release] granting the injunction stating that: "Senate Bill 4 would have led to rampant discrimination and made communities less safe. That's why police chiefs and mayors themselves were among its harshest critics &#8212; they recognized it would harm, not help, their communities."\\\</p>

<p>The city of El Cenizo initiated this suit in early May, and the cities of San Antonio, Austin, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and Travis subsequently joined via intervention or consolidation. Earlier this month, the Austin division of the same court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/federal-judge-dismisses-case-over-anti-sanctuary-city-legislation.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the state's action seeking a declaration that SB4 is constitutional. Specifically, federal judge Sam Sparks dismissed the action as moot stating that there was no "justiciable injury" to Texas, since there was not yet a challenge to the bill's constitutionality. The existence and functioning of sanctuary cities have come under fire since the very first week of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a>'s [official profile] administration. From the beginning of the year, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies, while some cities continue to <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In June the California State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] two bills which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college by preventing <a href="http://www.ice.gov">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> [official website] officers from entering a school site without a valid judicial warrant and approval from the superintendent. In March, the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. In February, the Alabama House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. Earlier the same month, San Francisco <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Trump administration over an executive order that would cut federal funding from sanctuary cities, including San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org">Supreme Court of Florida</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2017/sc17-653.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] a petition by <a href="http://www.sao9.net">State Attorney Aramis Ayala</a> [official website] challenging <a href="http://www.flgov.com">Governor Rick Scott's</a> [official website] power to reassign her death penalty eligible cases. Ayala announced in March of this year that she would <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/orlando-chief-prosecutor-rejects-death-penalty-for-all-future-cases.php">no longer be seeking the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in cases handled by her office. In response, Scott issued numerous executive orders assigning Ayala's ability to prosecute such cases to <a href="http://sao5.org/your-state-attorney.html">State Attorney for Florida's Fifth Judicial Circuit Brad King</a> [official website]. Scott argued that the <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Constitution">Florida Constitution</a> [text] empowered him to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The court concluded that the power to reassign death penalty eligible cases to another state attorney was well within Scott's constitutional and statutory powers. The court added, "Ayala's blanket refusal to seek the death penalty in any eligible case ... does not reflect an exercise of prosecutorial discretion; it embodies, at best, a misunderstanding of Florida law." Local news sources <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article170451127.html">have reported</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] that Ayala respects the decision of the court and will begin working with fellow state attorneys to resume evaluating first-degree murder cases in her jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The death penalty has become an increasingly controversial issue in recent years. In June a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ohios-execution-delay.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision and found Ohio's execution protocol to be constitutional. In that same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Earlier in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May the Delaware House of Representatives passed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. Florida's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury was signed into law in March. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/crb">Senior District Judge Charles Breyer</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">Northern District of California</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/3747-Order-Re-MTD-Wyoming-s-Complaint.pdf">blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit filed by the state of Wyoming against <a href="http://volkswagen.com/en.html">Volkswagen AG</a> (VW) [corporate website] over the diesel emission scandal. The court determined that because Volkswagen's illegal conduct occurred during the manufacturing process and impacted the US on a national level, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] would be better situated to both regulate VW and handle legal matters pertaining to the VW scandle. Wymoning was seeking up to an additional $1 billion dollars for damage caused to their environment as a result of VW's conduct. Commentators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/08/31/business/31reuters-volkswagen-emissions.html?_r=0">note</a> [NYT report] that this ruling will likely lead to the dismissal of similar suits filed by other states. </p>

<p>The Volkswagen scandal began in September 2015 when it was leaked that Volkswagen had intentionally circumvented emissions tests through installing technology to determine when emissions testing would take place and alter the cars emissions during inspections. The company has since undergone litigation in a number of countries throughout the world. In May a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-approves-volkswagen-emissions-settlement.php">federal court approved</a> [JURIST report] a $25 billion settlement related to vehicles sold in the us. In April a German court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/german-court-allows-use-of-seized-evidence-against-volkswagen.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the seizure of evidence against VW obtained during a raid of the law firm Jones Day. In December South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-to-file-criminal-action-against-volkswagen.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to fine the company for false advertising. In October a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/spain-court-orders-vw-to-pay-car-owner-over-emisions-scandal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Volkswagen to pay a car owner €5,006 for the 10% decrease in the car's value due to the emissions cheating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio Governor <a href="http://governor.ohio.gov/">John Kasich</a> [official website], Republican, and Colorado Governor <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/governor/">John Hickenlooper</a> [official website], Democrat, sent a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/354883159/7-26-17-Bipartisan-Governors-Letter-to-Senate-Leadership">letter</a> [text]  to Congress Thursday proposing a plan to preserve the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF] to <a href="https://www.apnews.com/ccd82bc73f7643f187b23fee55c129b5/Governors-urge-keeping-US-health-law's-individual-mandate">stabilize the healthcare market</a> [AP report]. The governors suggest preservation of the ACA's unpopular individual mandate provision, noting that it may be the "most important incentive for healthy people to enroll in coverage." Young, healthy people in the healthcare market lowers overall healthcare insurance prices. The letter explains that this plan is temporary but necessary to fix the current status of the market and allow Congress to construct a  plan to replace the ACA. The six other governors who endorsed this letter to Congress include, Republican Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada; Democratic Governors Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, Steve Bullock of Montana and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia; and Alaska Governor Bill Walker.</p>

<p>The plan comes in response to failed congressional efforts during this presidential term to replace the ACA and reform healthcare. In July the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/senate-introduces-new-healthcare-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a new bill that will allow insurance companies already providing policies under the ACA to offer cheaper plans with limited coverage options and contains provisions for providing states with funding for treating opiod addiction. The bill also included a provision requiring providers to give their customers maternity and newborn care, mental health services, prescription drug coverage, and hospitalization and emergency room coverage. In June Senate Republicans <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/senate-releases-health-care-bill-proposing-medicaid-cuts-end-to-aca-penalties.php">unveiled</a> their version of a health care bill proposing numerous changes to the ACA, including repeal of the the tax increases it enforced to pay for itself and <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/">Medicaid</a> [official website], essentially giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/MM/Pages/SRMyanmar.aspx">Yanghee Lee</a> [official profile] on Thursday expressed <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22018&LangID=E">grave concern</a> [press release] for Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar as the "cycle of violence" against them worsens. Thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41094485">nearly 18,000 more</a> [BBC report] are attempting the same in response to the violent outbreak that ensued in Myanmar last week. Military action against this Muslim population commenced last Friday after a group of Rohingya insurgents attacked 30 police stations. An <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/nearly-400-die-myanmar-army-steps-crackdown-rohingya-054034634.html">estimated 400 people</a> [Reuters report] have been killed as a result of the violence and nearly 38,000 have successfully entered Bangladesh. Coverage of the situation is limited, as few reporters have access to Rakhine state.</p>

<p>Human rights has been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. On Tuesday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein urged people to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22004&LangID=E">refrain from violence</a> [press release] against Myanmar security forces, for authorities to adhere to human rights law, and for authorities to prohibit use of provocative media usage in the northern regions of Rakhine state. In his statement, Zeid noted that the acts of violence committed in northern Rakhine against Myanmar security forces could have been "predicted and could have been prevented" due to "decades of persistent and systematic human rights violations [which] have almost certainly contributed to the nurturing of violent extremism." In March the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] passed a resolution to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-investigate-abuses-in-myanmar.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] potential human rights violations in Myanmar, but reported earlier this month that no such violations were <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/myanmar-government-inquiry-finds-no-crimes-against-humanity-in-rakhine-violence.php">found</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

President Uhuru Kenyatta was reelected after winning 54 percent of the votes in the recent election, which was held on August 8. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/assets/filemanager_uploads/A%20-%20Presidential%20Petitions%202017/The%20Petition.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF], filed on August 18 by Raila Odinga, who won 44 percent of the vote, alleged that the election failed to comply with several of the requirements established under Kenya's constitution. It also contends that the 2.6 percent of votes that were rejected was "deserving of an inquiry." The Supreme Court found that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission "failed to conduct the election in the manner set in the Constitution," but did not find any wrong doing from Kenyatta. The new vote must be held within 60 days. This is the first time that a court in Africa invalidated an election due to irregularities in voting.</p>

<p>The election has sparked violent protests, <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-protest-of-president-reelection-results-in-death-of-citizens.php">resulting</a> [JURIST report] in at least 24 people dead, according to the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-chief-urges-kenya-leaders-to-avoid-post-election-violence.php">called on Kenyan leaders</a> [JURIST report] to "take the responsible path and exercise their leadership to avoid violence" after these deadly protests. Protests the following Kenya's 2007 election, which Odinga also lost, resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, triggering an International Criminal Court investigation and charges that were <a href="paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">ultimately dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta. On Monday Kenya's Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-top-court-orders-election-commission-to-give-opposition-access-to-vote-count.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the election commission to allow Odinga and Kenyatta limited access to its computer servers and electronic devices so that they could assess the vote-count themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.txed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://ia601604.us.archive.org/25/items/gov.uscourts.txed.171486/gov.uscourts.txed.171486.99.0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">United States Department of Labor</a> [official website] overstepped its authority when it increased the minimum salary level for exempt employees from $23,660 annually to $47,476 annually. The court found that Congress had intended to exempt employees who work in a "bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity" from overtime pay requirements. The court determined that by focusing exclusively on the employee's salary as the basis for exemption, the Department had impermissibly ignored the employee's duties. <br />
<blockquote>Congress unambiguously directed the Department to exempt from overtime pay employees who perform &#8220;bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity&#8221; duties. However, the Department creates a Final Rule that makes overtime status depend predominately on a minimum salary level, thereby supplanting an analysis of an employee&#8217;s job duties. The Department estimates 4.2 million workers currently ineligible for overtime, and who fall below the minimum salary level, will automatically become eligible under the Final Rule without a change to their duties. ... Because the Final Rule would exclude so many employees who perform exempt duties, the Department fails to carry out Congress&#8217;s unambiguous intent.<br />
</blockquote>The $47,476 annual salary was determined by taking the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest wage region of the country. Suggesting that an inflation-based adjustment to the salary limit would alter its decision, the court acknowledged that the Department could continue to use "a permissible minimum salary level as a test for <em>identifying</em> categories of employees Congress intended to exempt." </p>

<p>The Department of Labor <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/23/2016-11754/defining-and-delimiting-the-exemptions-for-executive-administrative-professional-outside-sales-and">published</a>[text] the new salary level in May 2016, which would have made 4 million more Americans eligible for overtime pay, after then-President Obama <a href="/documents/presidentialmemos/2014/03/2014-06138.php">directed the department</a> [presidential memorandum] to update the overtime regulations. In December 2016, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/obama-administration-appeals-ruling-blocking-overtime-pay-rule.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-judge-halts-overtime-wage-reform.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST reports] halting application of the rule. In September 2016, twenty-one states including Texas and Nevada <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/21-states-file-suit-against-overtime-rule.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the Department challenging the overtime regulations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Individuals blocked from entering the US by President Donald Trump's original travel ban order can reapply for visas, under the terms of a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/signed_settlement_agreement_darweesh_v._trump_no_exhibit.pdf">settlement</a> [text, PDF] reached Thursday. Those who have a right to reapply are to be informed and notified of legal services that can aid them. The two main plaintiffs in this <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/darweesh-v-trump">case</a> [ACLU backgrounder], Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, had been <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/1-_complaint.pdf">detained</a> [complaint, PDF] at JFK airport last January after the first travel ban was ordered. Becca Heller, Director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, welcomed the settlement:<blockquote>On January 27, Hameed Darweesh and thousands of others attempted to legally enter the United States. They were detained, handcuffed and, in many cases, deported. This settlement forces the government to individually reach out to everyone illegally kept out of the country, and begin to remedy that wrong. But it is only a first step &#8212; we continue to fight against the illegal, discriminatory, and un-American provisions of the second Muslim ban.</blockquote>The lead plaintiff now currently lives in the US with his family.</p>

<p>Earlier this week a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/ninth-circuit-questions-necessity-of-travel-ban.php">questioned</a> [JURIST report] a Justice Department lawyer in a hearing regarding the revised travel ban. In July a judge for the US District Court for the District of Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-expands-travel-ban-exemptions.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the exemptions permitted under the Trump administration's temporary travel ban on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. The US Supreme Court is scheduled to hear further arguments on the matter in October. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] granted a <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TexasSB8-TRO.pdf">temporary restraining order</a> [text, PDF] Thursday, blocking Texas officials from enforcing a ban on the most common second trimester abortion procedure. The ban that was halted by <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/JudgesInfo/Lists/Judges%20Bios/DispForm.aspx?ID=3&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etxwd%2Euscourts%2Egov%2FJudgesInfo%2FSitePages%2FJudgeDirectoryBio%2Easpx&ContentTypeId=0x0100A21A2D68A91AD8479639817C3091CCAF">Judge Lee Yeakel</a> [official profile] originates in <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/2017">Senate Bill 8</a> [text] and would have taken effect Friday. The judge found that the state's arguments to prevent the restraining order unpersuasive and to possess a "thin record." "The State's interest notwithstanding, this court finds no authority for holding that government-mandated medically unnecessary, untested, or a more invasive procedure, or a more complicated and risky procedure with no proven medical benefits over the safe and commonly used banned procedure, is a permissible means of regulating previability abortions." </p>

<p>Abortion remains a contentious issue around the world. Earlier this month Chile's <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.cl/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chile-court-allows-abortion-in-some-cases-1.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize abortion in certain circumstances. In June the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland must remedy harm done to a woman in 2010 after denying her an abortion. The <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">Delaware legislature</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] in June that guarantees access to abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">appealed</a> [press release] to the international community Tuesday to conduct an investigation into allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen, after a new UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/MENARegion/Pages/YemenReport2017.aspx">report</a> [text] revealed that such violations continue with no apparent end in sight. The mandatory report is published by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] recording violations of human rights and humanitarian law over a three-year period ending August 2017. According to the report, 5,144 civilians, including 1,184 children, have been killed between March 2015, and August 30, 2017. During the same period, 8,749 have been injured, of which 1,592 were children. The report indicates coalition airstrikes to be the leading cause of civilian casualties. These airstrikes have reportedly targeted markets, hospitals, schools, residential areas, funeral gatherings, and other public and private infrastructure. The report also indicates that The Popular Committees affiliated with the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/yemen-houthis-hadi-protests-201482132719818986.html">Houthis</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder] and army units loyal to former President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/yemen/2011/02/201122812118938648.html">Abdullah Saleh</a> [Al Jazeera profile] are responsible for recruiting approximately 67 percent of the 1,702 cases of child soldiers. Zeid expressed his dismay at the international community's inaction, stating:<blockquote>I have repeatedly called on the international community to take action&#8212;to set up an independent, international investigation into the allegations of very serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Yemen. ... The reticence of the international community in demanding justice for the victims of the conflict in Yemen is shameful, and in many ways contributing to the continuing horror.</blockquote>Reiterating that an international investigation into the rights violations in Yemen is crucial, Zeid concluded by appealing "to all the parties to the conflict, those supporting them and those with influence over them to have mercy on the people of Yemen, and to take immediate measures to ensure humanitarian relief for civilians and justice for the victims of violations."</p>

<p>This report comes out less than a week after after 56 national, regional and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/ngos-call-for-independent-inquiry-into-yemen-rights-violations.php">sent an open letter</a> [JURIST report] to representatives of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/CurrentMembers.aspx">Member and Observer States</a> [materials] of the HRC calling for an "independent, international inquiry" into violations of human rights in Yemen. The state of human rights in Yemen has been rapidly deteriorating since October, when UN rights expert Heiner Bielefeldt <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-yemen-must-stop-harassment-of-religious-community.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Yemen for detaining individuals belonging to the religious community. In June, the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/hrw-accuses-uae-of-supporting-human-rights-abuses-in-yemen.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the UAE of backing "Yemeni forces that have arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and abused dozens of people during security operations." In May, UN expert on freedom of religion Ahmed Shaheed <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-freedom-of-religion-expert-urges-yemen-to-stop-persecution-of-bahai-community.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Houthi de facto authorities in Yemen must end harassment against the <a href="http://www.bahai.org/">Bahá'í</a> [official website] community in the Yemen capital, Sana'a. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein reported that more than 13,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the last two years and more than 80 percent of the population are in need of humanitarian assistance, in his March, statement <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-right-chief-calls-for-a-cease-fire-in-yemen.php">calling for an immediate ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] in the Yemen war and continued international support in ending the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-daca">announced</a> [prepared remarks] the Trump administration's plans to dismantle the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [official website] program, which gives undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, protection from deportation. According to a White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-responsibility-and-rule-law">press release</a> [text], "The Trump Administration is taking responsible action to wind down DACA in an orderly and minimally disruptive manner." No new undocumented immigrants may register under DACA, and the immigrants whose DACA documents are about to expire must renew by October 5, 2017.  The administration said, "Under the change announced today, current DACA recipients generally will not be impacted until after March 5, 2018, six months from now. That period of time gives Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions." Civil rights organizations have criticized Trump's plan. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] director of immigration policy, Lorella Praeli, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-statement-termination-daca">said</a> [press release], "Today is a cruel day for Dreamers, our families, and all Americans." </p>

<p>Crackdowns on immigration have been a controversial part of Trump's presidency. Last month Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-pardons-former-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] a former Arizona sheriff who had been found guilty of criminal contempt for his refusal to follow a court order in regards to racial profiling. Also in August Chicago <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chicago-sues-trump-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration over sanctuary city funding. That same month rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/aclu-and-other-rights-groups-sue-state-department-over-diversity-visa-denials.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the State Department over diversity visa denials. Two days before Trump had <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-announces-support-for-skill-based-immigration-system.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] his support for a skill based immigration system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en"> New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/settlement-paves-way-equal-treatment-lgbtq-students-buffalo-high-school">announced</a> [press release] a <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2017-08-31_elliott_v_buffalo_schools_settlement_proposed_dismissal.pdf">settlement</a> [dismissal, PDF] with <a href="http://www.buffaloschools.org/">Buffalo City School District</a> [official website] to halt discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students in the district. The settlement came in a <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/ecf_1_elliottv.bcsd_complaint_20170510.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] the NYCLU filed in May alleging the school openly and consistently allowed discrimination by preventing students from forming a <a href="https://gsanetwork.org/">Gay Straight Alliance</a> (GSA) [advocacy website] student organization as well as prohibiting same-sex prom dates. The settlement states:<blockquote>The Parties enter into this Agreement out of a mutual desire to protect the constitutional and statutory rights of all students in the Mckinley High School community, to ensure the safety and well-being of LGBTQ students, and to increase awareness of the District's existing anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, all in a cost-effective, timely, and collaborative manner.</blockquote>The settlement not only allows for a GSA on site, but also requires a two survey to track bias incidents as well as assemblies to educate students on their rights and protections.</p>

<p>Protections and regulations for LGBT individuals are still forming across the country. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/nj-governor-christie-signs-bill-directing-school-boards-to-recognize-transgender-rights.php">signed a bill into law</a> [JURIST report]  in July directing New Jersey school boards to "addres[s] common issues concerning the needs of transgender and LGBTQ students, and to assist schools in establishing policies and procedures that ensure a supportive and nondiscriminatory environment for transgender students." Utah Governor Gary Herbert in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-repealing-part-of-law-that-barred-advocacy-of-homosexuality.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] amendments to SB 196, repealing language that barred "advocacy of homosexuality" in Utah public schools. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/kentucky-governor-signs-law-protecting-students-rights-to-express-religious-views.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] into law in March aimed at protecting student organizations' rights to manage internal affairs in a manner that is consistent with the group's religious or political beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Colombia's government signed a peace agreement with the <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/eln">National Liberation Army</a> (ELN) [InSight Crime profile] in Ecuador on Monday, two days before Pope Francis's visit to the country. In a speech on Monday, Colombia's president, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2016/santos-facts.html">Juan Manuel Santos</a> [biography], <a href="http://es.presidencia.gov.co/discursos/170904-Palabras-del-Presidente-Juan-Manuel-Santos-durante-la-inauguracion-de-la-nueva-planta-de-Grupo-Bimbo-en-Colombia">said</a> [press release, in Spanish] that the during the ceasefire agreement, the ELN pledged not to kidnap or harass citizens, or attack the nation's pipelines.  "That is very important, because all this leads is to protect the Colombians," said Santos. He also called on the message of reconciliation that will be given by Pope Francis later in the week. The president said the deal would be renewed on January 12 if progress between the two groups is made. Colombia <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/colombia-govt-eln-sign-ceasefire-amid-growing-dissidence">promised</a> [InSight Crime press release] to suspend military operations against the group, improve conditions for imprisoned ELN members, and protect human rights defenders. The ELN is the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2017/09/04/colombia-signs-cease-fire-deal-with-last-guerrilla-group/EJjJ86m7bBCuIgLjADrIfJ/story.html">last major guerrilla group</a> [AP report] in Colombia. </p>

<p>In July Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/colombia-grants-amnesty-to-farc-members.php">granted amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to members of FARC, the larger of the two guerrilla organizations. The Colombian government and the FARC reached a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/colombia-government-and-farc-rebels-reach-new-peace-deal-after-referendum-rejection.php">peace agreement</a> [JURIST report] in November to end the guerrilla warfare that has been plaguing the country for more than five decades. In December Colombia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/colombia-court-approve-plan-for-expedited-peace-deal-with-rebels.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the government's plan to expedite a peace deal with the FARC. Also that month the Colombian Congress <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/colombia-congress-approves-amnesty-measure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a measure granting amnesty to low-level FARC guerrillas who have not committed atrocious crimes. Colombian voters in October narrowly <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/colombia-voters-reject-peace-deal-with-farc-rebels.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the previous peace deal negotiated between Santos and Timoleon Jimenez, the leader of the FARC. The Colombian government and the FARC signed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/colombia-and-farc-agree-to-bilateral-ceasefire.php">ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] in June 2016, marking an end to more than 50 years of armed conflict between the two groups.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kem Sokha, head of the <a href="http://www.cnrp7.org/en/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP) [party website] was charged Tuesday with treason after his arrest on Sunday. The arrest of Sokha was first <a href="https://twitter.com/MNVKem/status/904032181923835904">announced</a> [Tweet] by his daughter on social media. Sokha and others were <a href="https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/nrp-leader-kem-sokha-arrested-treason-134249/">arrested and charged</a> [Cambodia Daily report] with committing acts of treason by colluding with <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/breaking-kem-sokha-officially-charged-treason">foreign agencies</a> [Phnom Penh Post report]. At issue is the international support Sokha receives ahead of next year's election, which resulted in a televised broadcast in Australia. Sokha not only <a href="https://asiancorrespondent.com/2017/09/cambodia-opposition-leader-arrested-newspaper-shut-govt/#XMqqjaWER5Qcc3lo.97">heads</a> [Asian Correspondent report]  the opposition party but also is associated with a local newspaper that was <a href="https://twitter.com/julia_wallace/status/904596040594030592">temporarily shutdown</a> [tweet] as a result of the raid. The International community has <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22023&LangID=E">condemned</a> [UN press release] the <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/09/273808.htm#.WawGrk9WHNQ.twitter">arrest</a> [US press release] as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-asia-concerned-about-arrest-of-kem-sokha-in-cambodia">interference</a> [UK press release] in democratic elections. </p>

<p>The arrest comes on the heels of the Cambodian government cracking down on political opposition within the country. Cambodia's National Assembly in July <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/cambodia-passes-bill-to-stifle-government-opposition.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits political parties from being affiliated with convicted criminals. The US Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-joins-international-concern-over-cambodia-detainees.php">issued a press release</a> [text] in May expressing concern over the prolonged pretrial detention of five Cambodian activist. A law <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/cambodia-approves-law-allowing-judges-to-dissolve-political-parties.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in February by Cambodia's parliament gives the Supreme Court the power to dissolve any political parties it finds unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-177082">ruled 11-6</a> [judgment] that unrestricted monitoring of an employee's communication by his or her employer constitutes a violation of Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (Article 8) [text, PDF], concerning the "right to respect for private and family life." This ruling concerns a <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press?i=003-5825428-7419362">2007 incident</a> [press release, PDF] wherein a private company in Romania was monitoring the Yahoo! Messenger communications of its employee, Bogdan Mihai Bărbulescu, who was asked to create the messenger account to respond to client inquiries. Bărbulescu used the messenger for personal purposes in addition to using it for business purposes. This resulted in Bărbulescu's immediate termination from his employment. Bărbulescu unsuccessfully challenged the company's decision in the courts of Romania, and the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal in June 2008 stating that the company had acted reasonably under the circumstances. Bărbulescu then filed the case with the ECHR relying on Article 8, and once again lost the case in the lower chamber, which ruled that there was no Article 8 violation and that the Romania courts struck a fair balance between the Bărbulescu's right to respect for his private life and his employer's interests. The case came to the Grand Chamber in June 2016, which disagreed with the lower chamber's conclusions stating that "an employer's instructions cannot reduce private social life in the workplace to zero." The Court added that the Romania courts failed to examine whether Bărbulescu had been provided sufficient notice of potential monitoring of his communications, the degree of intrusion into Bărbulescu's private life through real time monitoring, whether there was a legitimate reason for the monitoring, and whether less intrusive methods could have been used to accomplish the intended purpose of detecting violations of the company's regulations. Thus, the Grand Chamber concluded that the Romania courts failed to strike a balance between the competing interests, and Article 8 was indeed violated.</p>

<p>Privacy has been a contentious topic around the world in the past two years. In June, Japan's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/japan-parliament-approves-controversial-counterterrorism-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a controversial "anti-conspiracy" bill aimed at improving security and combating terrorism that critics claim will violate privacy rights. In May, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/germany-court-allows-government-websites-to-save-user-data.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that government websites can store personal data as long as they provide adequate justification. The same month, the <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Senate/">Nevada Senate</a> [official website]  <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/nevada-senate-approves-internet-privacy-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring Internet providers to disclose what types of personal information they collect from users. In April, JURIST Guest Columnist Andreas Kuersten <a href="/hotline/2017/04/Andreas-Kuersten-internet-consumer-privacy.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the flawed reasoning of a legislation signed earlier this year that allows Internet Service Providers to sell customers' personal information without their consent. Also in April, a group of US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/senators-introduce-bill-to-protect-citizens-electronics-from-border-searches.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a bipartisan bill to require government agents to get a warrant when searching electronic devices of US citizens at the border. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Guatemalan <a href="http://www.oj.gob.gt/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled on Monday that legislators will review a request to lift President Jimmy Morales's immunity from prosecution amid mounting evidence of illegal political financing. According to prosecutors, Morales's 2015 presidential campaign secretly <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/guatemala-request-lift-morales-immunity-proceed-170904215031343.html">received</a> [Al Jazeera report] $825,000 in financing, and certain expenses were paid for by an unknown source of funding. While Morales has denied such accusations, Morales' political party, the National Convergence Front, and several others are currently under investigation. When Colombian prosecutor Ivan Velasquez <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-top-court-halts-deportation-of-un-anti-corruption-official.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] his intention to have Morales' immunity lifted last month, Morales ordered Velasquez deported. Last Tuesday, however, the Supreme Court responded by suspending the order. The Supreme Court has stated that there is sufficient evidence to transfer the case to Congress. A five-committee must now be formed to review the case and issue a conclusion on the matter. The request will need 105 out of 158 votes in order to successfully lift Morales' immunity. </p>

<p>Guatemala has a history of political scandal. Former president Otto Pérez Molina and ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti were <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/guatemala-ex-president-accused-of-corruption.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of taking nearly 130 million in bribes in the beginning of 2011 by Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana. In August 2015 the Guatemalan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach Molina after he announced his intent to not resign after the scandal broke. In October, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] welcomed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-office-welcomes-new-guatemalan-draft-bill-on-constitutional-justice-r.php">draft bill</a> [JURIST report] on constitutional justice reforms in the Guatemala legislature, which "represents an historic opportunity to consolidate the remarkable progress the country has achieved in the fight against impunity and corruption in recent years." In June a Guatemalan judge who served as general secretary for Guatemala's soccer federation <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/guatemala-judge-pleads-guilty-in-fifa-fraud-case.php">pled guilty</a> [JURIST report] to fraud and conspiracy in the FIFA scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIBurundi/Pages/CoIBurundi.aspx">UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIBurundi/Pages/CoIBurundiReportHRC36.aspx">reported</a> [materials] on Monday that various crimes against humanity have been committed in the troubled country since investigations began in April 2015. In June the commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-violations-in-burundi.php">released evidence</a> [JURIST report] of human rights violations such as illegal executions, torture, inhumane treatment, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and detention, and orchestrated kidnappings. According to the commission, the perpetrators include intelligence, police, and military officials as well as members of the <em>Imbonerakure</em>, a youth league of the ruling party. The commission has expressed concern over the continuation of human rights violations as well as Burundi's lack of willingness to document human rights abuses and hold perpetrators accountable. The commission has called on Burundi to abide by its obligations as a member of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] and put an end to such abuses. Furthermore, the commission has requested the involvement of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) and <a href="https://au.int/">African Union</a> [official websites] to help find a resolution. The commission will release a final report on the matter later this month at the thirty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. </p>

<p>The controversy from President Pierre Nkurunziza's third term has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/africa/burundi">plunged the country</a> [HRW backgrounder] into a period of political violence and human rights violations. Last year, a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/burundi">report</a> [HRW report] of government forces targeting perceived opponents with threats and violence heightened. As a result thousands of Burundians have <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-agency-burundi-violence-driving-thousands-to-flee.php">fled the country</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-suspension-of-ngos-in-burundi-deeply-regrettable.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the suspension of 10 non-governmental organizations in Burundi, calling it "an attempt by Burundian authorities to silence dissenting voices." In October the <a href="http://www.assemblee.bi/">National Assembly of Burundi</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/paperchase/2016/10/burundi-votes-to-withdraw-from-the-icc---dnp.php">voted to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the ICC after the ICC began investigating into how the government interacts with those who oppose Nkurunziza. Nkurunziza was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] for his third term July 2015 causing public protest and violence.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan presidential candidate <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-21587054">Raila Odinga</a> [BBC profile], whose campaign against the incumbent president <a href="http://www.president.go.ke/">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [government website] was declared unsuccessful after a countrywide election last month by the <a href="https://public.rts.iebc.or.ke/enr/index.html#/Kenya_Elections_Presidential/1">Independent Electoral and Boundaries Committee</a> (IEBC) [government website], has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41159873">issued a statement</a> [BBC report] that he would not be participating in the October re-election process. The <a href="https://www.iebc.or.ke/uploads/resources/IukcNTAE3I.pdf">August election</a> [materials] itself has been <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/assets/filemanager_uploads/A%20-%20Presidential%20Petitions%202017/Rulings/Determination.pdf">invalidated by Kenya's highest court</a> [materials, PDF]. Odinga has stated that he will not participate in another election "without legal and constitutional guarantees."<blockquote>We know exactly what transpired in these last elections, we know what the IEBC did and we know that if we were to go back there will be no different results and that's why will say there will be no elections on the [October 17th election date].</blockquote>ast week Kenya's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/kenyan-supreme-court-invalidates-recent-presidential-election-results.php">ruled 4-2 to invalidate the recent presidential election</a> [JURIST report]. Kenyatta was reelected after winning 54 percent of the votes in the recent election, which was held on August 8. The election has sparked violent protests, <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-protest-of-president-reelection-results-in-death-of-citizens.php">resulting</a> [JURIST report] in at least 24 people dead, according to the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-chief-urges-kenya-leaders-to-avoid-post-election-violence.php">called on Kenyan leaders</a> [JURIST report] to "take the responsible path and exercise their leadership to avoid violence" after these deadly protests. Protests the following Kenya's 2007 election, which Odinga also lost, resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, triggering an International Criminal Court investigation and charges that were <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">ultimately dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta. Last week Kenya's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/kenya-top-court-orders-election-commission-to-give-opposition-access-to-vote-count.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the election commission to allow Odinga and Kenyatta limited access to its computer servers and electronic devices so that they could assess the vote-count themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/<br />
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Donald Trump's</a> [campaign website] campaign attorney <a href="http://www.jonesday.com/macarvin/">Michael Carvin</a> [professional profile] filed a <a href="http://static.politico.com/63/f5/b8651f7844c0a1ca2815cb7bb06d/cockrummtd090517.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] asking the court to dismiss a lawsuit that accuses the Trump campaign of conspiring with Russian operatives. The case <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/05/trump-campaign-wikileaks-hack-lawsuit-242344">was originally filed</a> [POLITICO report] on behalf of three <a href="https://www.democrats.org">Democratic Party</a> [official website] affiliates who claim the Trump campaign conspired with Russian operatives to publish data illegally obtained from the Democratic National Committee on Wikileaks. The Trump campaign argued that the case is meritless as the affiliates lack the factual support to sustain their claims of collusion. The campaign's attorney also noted that the complaint "foreshadows" an impending "fishing expedition" into Trump's tax records, business relationships, real estate projects, and many other controversial aspects of the President's past. A decision on the brief is expected in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Allegations of Russian connections have been a problem for the Trump administration since the early stages of his presidency. In June US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ag-sessions-testifies-before-senate-committee-in-russia-investigation.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in relation to his alleged ties to Russia and its coordination with President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. When asked why he had initially stated those conversations did not take place, Sessions said that he was flustered by the questioning and misunderstood what was being asked of him. He also said that he did not <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recuse</a> himself from the investigations because of his <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">failure to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] those meetings. In May Former FBI director James Comey<a href="/paperchase/2017/06/former-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-against-trump-administration.php"> testified</a> [JURIST report] in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Earlier in May the committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-intelligence-committee-subpoenas-former-nsa-leader-flynn.php">issued a subpoena</a> [JURIST report] compelling former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to provide documents related to the committee's investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. Also in May former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-ag-yates-tells-senate-she-warned-of-flynn-vulnerability.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that she had warned about Flynn's vulnerabilities to blackmail by Russia less than a week after President Donald Trump assumed office. In March now-former FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the FBI was investigating allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/09/05/costs-international-advocacy/chinas-interference-united-nations-human-rights">condemned</a> [report] both China's oppression of critics of the nation's human rights record and the UN's failure to stop such conduct. The report alleges that, "China has worked consistently and often aggressively to silence criticism of its human rights record before UN bodies and has taken actions aimed at weakening some of the central mechanisms available in those institutions to advance rights." HRW argued that because of China's growing influence in the world, their violations of international human rights must be addressed. The report alleged that China attempted to prevent Chinese activists from leaving the country to go to UN-sponsored events, harassing those that have attended such events, and have prevented activists from communicating with UN human rights investigators. Such acts by the government, HRW argues, introduce a "longer-term challenge to the integrity of the [Chinese government] as a whole." As to their criticisms of the UN, HRW stated that, "UN officials have at times pushed back against improper Chinese pressure or steadfastly ignored it, in other instances, they have capitulated ... or have soft-pedaled their concerns, presumably to avoid confrontation with China." The report concludes with a plea to the UN to view violations of human rights by China more objectively and to take more direct action against such infractions. </p>

<p>China's human rights record has been of international concern for many years now. In February, the <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/">Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing crackdowns of human rights defenders by China. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of Jiang Tianyong</a>, [JURIST report] after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. In September China handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">12-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July 2016 China announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. In April 2016 a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested and released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015e-546a-df04-a5df-d46fe71d0000">stayed an injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] that had blocked the <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00005F.pdf#navpanes=0">Texas voter ID law</a> [SB 5, PDF], allowing its implementation.</p>

<p>The injunction was <a href=/paperchase/2017/08/federal-judge-blocks-revised-texas-voter-id-law.php">put in place</a> [JURIST report] by Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] in late August after she found the revised law discriminatory against minority voters. Ramos had previously found that a <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/SB00014I.pdf#navpanes=0">2011 law</a> [SB 14 materials], which required voters to present a form of government-issued ID, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rules-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">discriminated</a> [JURIST report] against blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<p>According to the appeals court: <blockquote>The State has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits. SB 5 allows voters without qualifying photo ID to cast regular ballots by executing a declaration that they face a reasonable impediment to obtaining qualifying photo ID. This declaration is made under the penalty of perjury. ... The State has made a strong showing that this reasonable-impediment procedure remedies plaintiffs' alleged harm and thus forecloses plaintiffs' injunctive relief. When this court remanded the case to the district court, the scope of the mandate only included the discretion to consider "any interim legislative action with respect to SB 14" in fashioning an "interim remedy for SB 14's discriminatory effect. By enjoining SB 5 from taking effect on January 1, 2018, the district court went beyond the scope of the mandate on remand.</blockquote>The court also opined that the stay of the injunction will allow time for the case to proceed to the court on the merits. "A temporary stay here, while the court can consider argument on the merits, will minimize confusion among both voters and trained election officials." <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=193374&mode=lst&pageIndex=1&dir=&occ=first&part=1&text=&doclang=EN&cid=504544">ruled</a> [judgment] that Slovakia and Hungary must host asylum seekers as a part of the <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-v-area-of-freedom-security-and-justice/chapter-2-policies-on-border-checks-asylum-and-immigration/346-article-78.html">EU migration policy</a> [EU materials]. Slovakia and Hungary filed a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=173998&mode=lst&pageIndex=1&dir=&occ=first&part=1&text=&doclang=EN&cid=504544">complaint</a> [text] arguing that it was illegal for Brussels to require them to take in hundreds of Syrian refugees and that it would destabilize their economies. <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-09/cp170091en.pdf">According to the court</a> [press release], the requirement of each EU state to take a quota of refugees helps stabilize the 2015 migration crisis and that under law it has authority to "adopt all provisional measures necessary to respond effectively and swiftly to an emergency situation characterized by a sudden inflow of displaced persons." The court also stated that the legality of its decision is not affected by the effectiveness of the policy. The court has further defended the policy stating that, "The small number of relocations so far carried out under the contested decision can be explained by a series of factors &#8230; including, in particular, the lack of cooperation on the part of certain member states."</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations have emerged as significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. In February <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-expresses-concern-over-hungarys-proposed-migration-amendments.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over a proposed Hungary migration amendment. In January HRW <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/hrw-asylum-seekers-in-croatia-being-forced-back-to-serbia-is-against-eu-policy.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that it was against EU policy for Croatia to force asylum seekers back to Serbia. Also in January the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/european-commission-asylum-conditions-on-greek-islands-dire-due-to-snow.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] the conditions on Greek Islands for asylum seekers as "untenable" due to heavy snowfall in the region. In March Hungarian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-detention-of-asylum-seekers.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation preventing those seeking asylum from moving about the country or leaving until their claims have been investigated. Ahead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in September, UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-protect-women-and-girls-in-migration.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] states to protect women and girls in the movement of refugees and migrants by adhering to international human rights conventions and standards.  In June the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/eu-launches-procedures-against-czech-republic-poland-and-hungary-for-refusing-asylum-seekers.php">started infringement procedures</a> [JURIST report] against the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungay for refusal to comply with the emergency relocation scheme. In October 2015 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-urges-czech-republic-to-stop-detaining-migrants-and-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to the Czech Republic to stop detaining migrants and refugees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of prominent Republicans on Monday and filed amicus briefs imploring the Supreme Court to end gerrymandering. The Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gill-v-whitford/">Gill v. Whitford</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on October 3. Prominent politicians who filed briefs urging the court to find gerrymandering unconstitutional include: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Whitford%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf">John McCain and Sheldon Whitehouse</a> [brief, PDF] and <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Gill_AmicusBrief_Republican_Statewide_Officials_InSupportofAppellees.pdf"> John Kasich, Bob Dole, Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Danforth and Richard Lugar, among others</a> [brief, PDF]. A number of Republican organization filed briefs for the other side urging the court to reject a challenge to voting districts in Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Voting rights and how congressional districts are drawn have become increasingly contentious issues over the past few years. The Supreme Court agreed to hear <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-wisconsin-partisan-gerrymandering-case.php">this case</a> [JURIST report] in June. Earlier the same month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-affirms-order-finding-north-carolina-racial-gerrymandering.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a>[SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting of Districts 1 and 12 was unconstitutional because the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In January the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. In April 2016 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">unanimously upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary-General António Guterres</a> [official website] called on the government of Myanmar Tuesday to <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2017-09-05/secretary-generals-press-encounter">grant</a> [press statements] nationality, or at least legal status, to the Rohingya Muslim minority group that resides in the Rakhine State of Myanmar. Myanmar's security forces have responded to recent violence from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army with indiscriminate attacks in the Rakhine State. Guterres stated that the granting of nationality was necessary to allow the members of the minority group to live a normal life, "including freedom of movement and access to labour markets, education and health services." More than 125,000 people have now sought refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Guterres stated that the plight of the Rohingya is becoming an "undeniable factor in the regional destabilization of the region."</p>

<p>The plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar has been on ongoing humanitarian crisis for many years. The UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-investigate-abuses-in-myanmar.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] in March that called for an investigation into the potential human rights violations in Myanmar. Earlier in March, the UN Special Rapporteur <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-independent-investigation-into-myanmar-violations.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an international investigation into the crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the Myanmar government against the Rohingya minority population. In February, the UN Special Rapporteur<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-expert-calls-for-myanmar-to-end-persecution-against-muslims.php"> called for</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar to end the persecution of the Rohingya minority. Also in February, Myanmar officials <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/myanmar-to-investigate-alleged-police-crimes-against-rohingya-muslims.php">stated </a>[JURIST report] that they would investigated alleged police crimes against Rohingya Muslims. Furthermore, earlier in February, the Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/human-rights-watch-calls-for-myanmar-to-endorse-investigation-into-abuse.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into the abuses against the Rohingya population, specifically the sexual abuses against women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/press/2017/new-york-et-al-v-trump-et-al-17cv5228.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday challenging the Trump administration's decision to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-responsibility-and-rule-law">end</a> [press release] the Obama-era <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</a> (DACA) [USCIS materials] program. DACA provides <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ny/new-york-to-file-lawsuit-protecting-daca-beneficiaries-idUSKCN1BH1HS">protection</a> [Reuters report] from deportation to undocumented immigrants, often called "Dreamers," who were brought to the US as children. New York Attorney General <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/">Eric Schneiderman</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-schneiderman-and-gov-cuomo-announce-new-york-state-will-sue-if">statement</a> [official statement] on Tuesday vowing to sue the president to protect the young immigrants. Schneiderman proclaimed that "[the Dreamers] played by the rules. They pay their taxes. And they've earned the right to stay in the only home they have ever known."</p>

<p>The Trump administration's decision to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/04/politics/daca-dreamers-immigration-program/index.html">disband</a> [CNN report] DACA will affect nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants. No new undocumented immigrants may <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/trump-administration-to-eliminate-daca-program.php">register</a> [JURIST report] under DACA, and the immigrants whose DACA documents are about to expire must renew by October 5, 2017. According to the administration's press release, current DACA recipients generally will not be impacted until after March 5, 2018, which will give "Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions." <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">The American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] director of immigration policy, Lorella Praeli, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-statement-termination-daca">said</a> [press release], "Today is a cruel day for Dreamers, our families, and all Americans."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/">Attorney General Rodrigo Janot</a> [official website, in Portuguese] <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/noticias-pgr/pgr-denuncia-integrantes-do-pt-por-formacao-de-organizacao-criminosa">announced</a> [press release, in Portuguese] Tuesday that former Brazilian presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, along with other senior members of the Worker's Party, were being <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/documentos/Inq4325_dennciaecotaalterado.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF, in Portuguese] with leading a criminal organization. The organization was allegedly involved in paying bribes to politicians through inflating state contracts. In total, roughly $480 million in bribes are believed to have been paid during the 2002 to 2016 presidencies of Lula and Rousseff. Lula is accused of being an "important leader" in the criminal organization and continuing the criminal organization through influence over Rouseff after Lula left the presidency. Members of the Democratic Movement Party and Progressive Party were also named in the indictment. </p>

<p>The latest charges are the latest in a string of corruption charges throughout many levels of government in Brazil. Lula da Silva was previously <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/former-brazil-president-convicted-of-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in July on corruption charges and sentenced to almost 10 years in prison. The current Brazilian president, Michel Temer, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-federal-police-find-evidence-of-president-receiving-bribes.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of accepting bribes in June. Former president Dilma Rousseff was impeached for <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil's <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers and dozen of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. In March, Brazil's top prosecutor asked Brazil's Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brazil-prosecutor-requests-83-new-investigations-into-petrobras-scandal.php">open 83 more investigations</a> [JURIST Report] into politicians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four UN human rights experts on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22028&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] China to release a prominent human rights lawyer who has been detained since November 2016. The lawyer, Jiang Tianyong, is being tried for inciting subversion of the state's power. The UN's call for his release comes after Jiang's August 22 <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/china-rights-lawyer-confesses-to-attempting-to-overthrow-government.php">confession</a> [JURIST report], which many believe was coerced and not authentic. Jiang has been detained without access to his family or a lawyer, which has fueled the widespread belief that his confession was not genuine. The experts are also concerned that the criminal activity Jiang is charged with constitutes a violation of the fundamental right to freely seek, receive and impart information about human rights. In the past, Jiang represented another lawyer who was being held in detention and is now accused of fabricating allegations of torture in that case.</p>

<p>China's human rights record has been of international concern for many years now. Earlier this week Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/hrw-china-systemically-oppressing-critics-of-human-rights-abuse.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] both China's oppression of critics of the nation's human rights record and the UN's failure to stop such conduct. In February the <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/">Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing crackdowns of human rights defenders by China. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of Jiang Tianyong</a>, [JURIST report] after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. In September China handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">12-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July 2016 China announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. In April 2016 a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested and released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Property owners in Harris County, Houston filed a class action <a href="/paperchase/Harvey%20complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [amended complaint, PDF] against the federal government on Tuesday for releasing water from the Barker and Addicks reservoirs after Hurricane Harvey, causing flooding in their homes and businesses. The property owners did not experience flooding until August 28, after the worst of the rain had passed. The <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official website] said it needed to release water at that time to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2017-08-28/us-army-corps-of-engineers-to-release-water-from-two-houston-area-dams-statement">prevent</a> [Reuters report] uncontrolled water flowing from the dams, which would have caused more damage to the surrounding community. The suit is based on a "takings" claim, arguing that the government took private property for a public use without any formal process or condemnation proceeding. A second federal lawsuit and a <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HoustonDams.pdf">state lawsuit</a> [petition, PDF] have also been filed.</p>

<p>Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented destruction to the Houston area last week, and many believe <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-climatechange/hurricane-harveys-aftermath-could-see-pioneering-climate-lawsuits-idUSKCN1BG2NI">blame</a> [Reuters report]. However, climate concerns and solutions are still hotly contested. In June President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-us-to-pull-out-of-the-paris-climate-deal.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US will no longer be part of the Paris climate accord. In May the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-votes-to-keep-methane-regulations.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a measure that would rollback methane gas regulations. The Trump administration in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-administration-requests-delay-of-appeals-court-ruling-on-clean-power-plan.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to postpone ruling on the Obama administration's climate change regulations. Despite the resistance in the US, the UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-calls-for-strong-anti-pollution-legislation-and-enforcement.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on global leaders in February to take urgent action on air pollution to ensure world citizens enjoy what the UN calls "the human rights to life and health in environments free from contamination."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d50e9e9a644ec746f8853881f40245e5d4.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4PaN4Se0?text=&docid=194082&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=551681">ruled</a> [text] on Wednesday that a 2009 antitrust case should be sent back to the lower court in order to reexamine the €1.06 billion fine placed on <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel</a> [corporate website] in the matter. The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/">EU General Court</a> (EGC) [official website] previously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-top-court-orders-reexamination-of-intel-antitrust-fine/2017/09/06/3d6d1f52-92db-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html?utm_term=.dcf4e67ac073">found</a> [WP report] in 2014 that Intel had violated EU competition law by using rebates to suppress computers using rival company <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/home">AMD's</a> [corporate website] chips in the European market. Intel has since referred to the fine as "manifestly disproportionate." In its Wednesday ruling, the ECJ determined that the EGC must now reexamine how much such rebates hindered competition from AMD. When the matter is eventually resolved, it is expected to have a larger impact on antitrust law in the EU. </p>

<p>High-profile antitrust litigation has been ongoing in 2017. In June, the EU fined Google and its parent company, Alphabet, € 2.42 billion for <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/eu-fines-google-242-billion-for-antitrust-violation.php">violating</a> [JURIST report] EU antitrust restrictions.In May EU antitrust regulators fined Facebook $122 million for <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/eu-fines-facebook-for-misleading-regulators-on-whatsapp-deal.php">misleading information</a> [JURIST report] regarding a deal for WhatsApp. In February the National Collegiate Athletic Association and 11 conferences agreed to a $208.7 million <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/ncaa-and-conferences-agree-to-2087-million-settlement-in-antitrust-suit.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action suit brought by former college athletes alleging their scholarships were illegally capped. In January a US federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-apple-antitrust-suit-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that plaintiffs may sue Apple for violating antitrust regulations by forcing users to purchase apps exclusively through their app store.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/09/05/we-do-unreasonable-things-here/torture-and-national-security-al-sisis-egypt">reported</a> [text] on Tuesday that security forces under the administration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi have systematically used torture methods against political detainees that likely amount to crimes against humanity. According to the report, officers have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/06/egypt-torture-epidemic-may-be-crime-against-humanity">routinely used</a> [HRW report] stressful positions, physical abuse, and even rape to punish detainees and force confessions. Such practices have reportedly been carried out in police stations and security offices across the country. Allegedly, the Interior Ministry and prosecutors have also contributed to this system of abuse by turning a blind eye to torture and pressuring detainees into supporting their forced confession. Between July 2013 and December 2016, amidst hundred of allegations, prosecutors reportedly only pursued 40 torture cases and only won 6 of them. According to the HRW, "President al-Sisi has effectively given police and National Security officers a green light to use torture whenever they please." The HRW has called for the establishment of an independent special prosecutor to properly investigate detention sites and security forces. Should the Sisi administration fail to address the ongoing matter, HRW further requests that UN members investigate and prosecute the Egyptian officials responsible for systematic torture. </p>

<p>Sisi's administration has recently been accused of numerous human rights violations. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-experts-express-concern-over-blocked-websites-in-egypt.php">issued a statement</a> [JURIST report] detailing their concern over websites, including many news sites, that have been shutdown or blocked by the Egyptian government. In June,  the UN stated that Egypt's new <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-high-commissioner-new-egypt-law-restricts-human-rights.php">NGO law</a> [JURIST report] will further restrict human rights advocacy. In May, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-egypt-security-measures-encouraging-radicalization.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the increased security measures the president has instituted since the bombings of Christian churches earlier this year. While condemning the attacks, al-Hussien said that al-Sisi's declaration of a three-month state of emergency was only going to increase radicalization. In April, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-trump-meeting-with-egypt-president-ignores-rights-abuses.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] US President Donald Trump's plan to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, saying the move effectively endorses the country's poor recent human rights record. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Widespread human rights violations continue in war-torn Syria despite a decrease in fighting between warring parties, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A_HRC_36_55_EN.docx">report</a> [text, PDF] released Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</a>, an investigatory branch of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official websites]. The alleged violations, characterized by the report as "unthinkable crimes against civilians," include "forced displacement, deliberate attacks against civilians, and the use of chemical weapons" such as sarin and weaponized chlorine. The report <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22030&LangID=E">includes events occurring between March and July of this year</a> [press release], a period of time that included a number of local truces between factions, including the so-called <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39426162">"Four Towns Agreement"</a> [BBC report]. While acknowledging the positive trend in reduced fighting, the report says that such truces often lead to evacuations, or "forced displacement," a war crime. "Warring parties must not only refrain from future agreements that forcibly displace civilians for political gains," wrote Commissioner <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/Biographies.aspx#karen">Karen AbuZayd</a> [official profile], "but they must also ensure adequate protection for all internally displaced persons countrywide, including their rights to life, to adequate food, shelter and medical care, and ultimately their right to return."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact on the country. Last week UN High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-chief-forces-fighting-islamic-state-must-protect-civilians.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] forces fighting Islamic State insurgents to regain lost territory in Syria to avoid sacrificing lives of civilians still trapped in the areas. Also last week UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/unicef-children-in-war-torn-countries-have-right-to-safe-water.php">voiced</a> [JURIST report] its concern that children in war-torn countries, including Syria, have a lack of safe drinking water. Earlier in May the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/house-passes-bill-to-impose-sanctions-on-assad-supporters.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to impose sanctions on supporters of Syria's Assad regime. The same month Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported new evidence that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in at least <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-syria-used-chemical-weapons-in-multiple-attacks.php">four recent attacks</a> [JURIST report] targeting civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Tuesday approved <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3388/">legislation</a> [HR 3388 materials] to allow self-driving cars into the marketplace. </p>

<p>The Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution (SELF DRIVE) Act will allow 100,000 autonomous vehicles into the market as long as they meet the federal regulation standards. </p>

<p>The purpose of the bill is to speed up the testing of automation and determine the requisite safety standards, which have had issues in <a href="/hotline/2017/01/John-Terwilleger-autonomous-vehicles.php">local courts</a> [JURIST op-ed]. This legislation would prevent states from blocking or adding requirements that are not in accordance with those set forth in the guidelines. The bill would also establish a council and mandate a review of the data collected from these 100,000 vehicles to determine the best regulations and safety features.</p>

<p>Additionally, the bill would require manufacturers to ensure the safety regulations also included cyber security measures:<blockquote>A manufacturer may not sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce, or import into the United States, any highly automated vehicle, vehicle that performs partial driving automation, or automated driving system unless such manufacturer has developed a cybersecurity plan.</blockquote>Manufactures would also be required to have a written privacy plan to ensure automated vehicles to not violate the rights of the owners or occupants. The plans and the information collected from the council will be made available to consumers before they purchase the vehicles.</p>

<p>The measure now goes to the senate for approval.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Dreiband, a <a href="http://www.jonesday.com/esdreiband/">partner at Jones Day</a> [professional profile] and former top attorney for the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> [official website], <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/08/08/2017/nominations">appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [materials] on Wednesday to answer questions as he seeks confirmation as the head of the Department of Justice's civil rights division. Dreiband was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/729">nominated</a> [materials] for the post by President Donald Trump on June 29. Critics of the nomination point to Dreiband's record defending large corporations in civil rights violation cases, including his representation of Abercrombie and Fitch in a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/01/411213623/supreme-court-rules-for-woman-denied-abercrombie-fitch-job-over-headscarf">suit brought by a Muslim woman</a> [NPR report] who claimed she was not hired because she wore a headscarf, and representing RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company in an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7322405965148730917">age discrimination case</a> [opinion]. During the hearing, Dreiband chose not to directly answer a hypothetical question from Democratic Senator <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/">Sheldon Whitehouse</a> [official website] of Rhode Island on whether a gay employee should enjoy the same protections as a deaf employee. Dreiband cited ongoing lawsuits related to the issue as the reason he could not answer the question. </p>

<p>If Dreiband is confirmed, he will join a Department of Justice (DOJ) that has faced increased scrutiny related to its position on various civil rights issues. On Tuesday US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/trump-administration-to-eliminate-daca-program.php">Trump administration's plans to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> [JURST report], or DACA, program, which gives undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, protection from deportation. Last month the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/doj-reverses-position-in-upcoming-supreme-court-voting-rights-case.php">reversed its position</a> [JURIST report] in a key voting rights case that will be before the Supreme Court later this year by filing an amicus brief in support of an Ohio maintenance tactic used to remove people from the voting rolls. In July the DOJ filed an amicus brief urging the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/07/doj-title-vii-does-not-protect-against-discrimination-based-on-sexual-orientation.php">dismiss a lawsuit brought by a man who claims he was fired for his sexual orientation</a> [JURIST report]. Conversely, some civil rights activist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/politics/domestic-terrorism-sessions.html">praised</a> [NYT report] Attorney General Sessions, the top lawyer within the DOJ, for his response to the violent clash between white supremecists and protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia last month. Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/sessions-orders-federal-probe-into-charlottesville-violence.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a federal investigation into the violence days after the incident, and condemned the actions as "racial bigotry and hatred." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">Australia High Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/HCATrans-176-2017-09-07.pdf">unanimously dismissed</a> [transcript, PDF] a legal challenge to a same-sex marriage postal survey, thereby allowing the general public to vote directly on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized. The focus of the legal challenge to the survey was more on a financial level than on a social level. The challenge to the postal survey was brought forth by proponents of marriage equality and concerned the $122 million appropriated for the purpose of the mail-in ballot. These plaintiffs argued that the government is attempting to fund the survey illegitimately by using a special reserve of the budget which is only to be used for "urgent" or "unforeseen" matters. In setting the stage, the court first refused to answer any questions in relation to the plaintiff's legal standing to challenge the survey. However, the court <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/samesex-marriage-power-to-the-people-as-judges-give-vote-green-light/news-story/2948d955032a8168a60ff8fe7e82bf2f">unanimously concluded</a> [The Australian report] that Section 10 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017A00060">Appropriation Act of 2017-18</a> [text] authorizes the Finance Minister to "make provision for expenditure that is outside the ordinary annual services of the Government" and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to any relief in this challenge. Furthermore, the court ordered that the plaintiffs must pay the costs of the entire case. Essentially this means that the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> [official website] can now conduct the survey and the $122 million can be used for funding the survey costs. The marriage equality proponents brought forth this challenge because they believed <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/postal-survey-cleared-by-high-court-to-settle-samesex-marriage-once-and-for-all-20170907-gycr1o.html">such a public vote would be very divisive</a> [SMH report], but are now confident that enough voters will vote "yes" on legalizing same-sex marriage. The postal survey will be mailed out starting Tuesday with a due date of November 7 for returning the completed surveys. The verdict is to be announced November 15. <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</a> [official website] promised to initiate a private member's legislation to legalize same-sex marriage if a majority of the public vote "yes" on the ballot.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage has become one of the most controversial issues in the recent past with the marriage equality movement making significant waves in the past two years. Last month, Chile <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidenta/">President Michelle Bachelet</a> [official profile, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chile-president-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex marriage. Bachelet said, "We believe that it is not ethical or just to place artificial limits on love or deny essential rights based solely on the sex of the partners." In July, Malta <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/malta-becomes-latest-country-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage. That same month, the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/uk-supreme-court-awards-equal-pension-rights-to-same-sex-spouse.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] equal pension rights to same-sex spouses. In June, the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 393-226 to legalize same-sex marriage. In April, Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against "unlawful assembly" and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An administrative court under the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/Tada.htm">Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act</a> (TADA court) [text] in Mumbai on Thursday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-blasts/indian-court-sentences-two-mumbai-1993-blasts-convicts-to-death-idUSKCN1BI0VN">sentenced</a> [Reuters report] Feroz Abdul Rashid Khan and Taher Merchant to death and Abu Salem and Karimullah Khan to life imprisonment for their involvement in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33713846">1993 Mumbai blasts</a> [BBC backgrounder] that killed 300 individuals and injured hundreds more. A fifth accused individual, Riyaz Siddiqui, was sentenced to 10 years in jail. This development follows the <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/special-administrative-court-finds-six-guilty-of-1993-mumbai-bombings.php">conviction of six individuals</a> [JURIST report] involved in the case in June, one of whom, Mustafa Dossa, died later the same month. Abu Salem had fled to Portugal sometime after the blasts, but was extradited in 2005 after a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/about/abu-salem-extradition/">protracted legal battle between the India and Portugal governments</a> [Indian Express archive]. The prime accused conspirator in the blast, Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, is believed to be hiding in Pakistan, but Pakistan has rejected such claims. Another key conspirator, Yakub Memon, was sentenced to death by the TADA court in 2007, and hanged in July 2015. Tiger Memon and 33 other individuals believed to be involved in the blasts are still missing. TADA court prosecutor Ujwal Nikam <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/QNpSQeA1P8EUp01iw8a4BP/1993-Mumbai-Blasts-verdict-Abu-Salem-gets-life-sentence.html">called</a> [LiveMint report] the verdict "historic" adding:<blockquote>the evidence we placed before the court in the 1993 blasts case can now be used in the cases against the main accused Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon who are absconding. In Abu Salem&#8217;s case, we could not ask for death penalty to respect the undertaking we had given to the Portugal government at the time of his extradition saying he would not be executed.</blockquote>Mumbai has been dealing with the aftermath of the 1993 bombings and the subsequent attacks in 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2011 for almost a quarter of a century. Earlier this year Pakistan authorities placed militant leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed under <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/pakistan-authorities-place-militant-leader-under-house-arrest.php">house arrest</a> [JURIST report] for his connection to the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Saeed has been accused of orchestrating the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/asia/mumbai-terror-attacks/">2008 Mumbai attacks</a> [CNN backgrounder]. In 2009 three individuals who were convicted of the 2003 bombings were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-court-sentences-mumbai-bombers-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report]. Later that year the trial of the only gunmen to have survived the 2008 mass shooting at a hotel continued <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">even though the man confessed his guilt</a> [JURIST report] in the midst of trial proceedings. The government responded to the slew of terrorist bombings by <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-government-urged-to-revive.php">reconsidering</a> [JURIST report] an anti-terror law that had been previously repealed and by creating special courts like the one involved with TADA to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/india-to-use-special-courts-for-mumbai.php">speed up the judicial process</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Sidney Fitzwater of the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/court-info">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3987748-Lee-Statue-Restraining-Order-Granted.html#document/p1">temporary restraining order</a> [text] on Wednesday prohibiting Dallas, Texas, officials from removing a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee. The restraining order came after the <a href="http://dallascityhall.com/government/Pages/city-council.aspx">Dallas City Council</a> [official website] <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/TXDALLAS-1b57037?wgt_ref=TXDALLAS_WIDGET_3">voted</a> [City Council press release] 13 to 1 on Wednesday to remove the statue immediately.  The <a href="http://www.scv.org/new/">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> [advocacy site] filed a complaint the same day, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-city-hall/2017/09/06/robert-e-lee-statue-dallas-removed-city-council-vote">alleging</a> [Dallas News report] that the voting was done improperly.  The restraining order is in effect until a hearing on Thursday afternoon. </p>

<p>Debate has intensified in the past years over the acceptability of confederate symbols in everyday life. Last March a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-rules-new-orleans-can-remove-confederate-statues.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that New Orleans can remove Confederate statues. Last year a federal lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/mississippi-flag-challenged-in-federal-lawsuit.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] against the governor of Mississippi challenging the state flag, the last one in the country that bears the Confederate battle emblem. In August 2015 a judge in Texas <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/judge-allows-removal-of-a-university-of-texas-confederate-statue.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a request for a temporary restraining order to halt the University of Texas at Austin from relocating a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. That July South Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/south-carolina-senate-votes-to-remove-confederate-flag-from-state-house.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] the Confederate flag from the state house. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York's highest state court, the <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/">Court of Appeals</a> [judicial website] <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2017/2017_06412.htm">ruled</a> [opinion PDF] on Thursday that the state constitution does not guarantee a right to physician assisted suicide. The claim was brought by three terminally ill patients against the New York Attorney General. "Physician assisted suicide" was defined as "the right of a mentally competent and terminally ill person to obtain a prescription for a lethal dosage of drugs from a physician, to be taken at some point to cause death."  On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that New Yorkers have a constitutional right to physician assisted suicide. The court found that there is no fundamental right to suicide, although there is a right to deny life-sustaining medical treatment. Applying the rational basis standard of review, the court decided that the state had a legitimate interest in criminalizing physician assisted suicide, namely protecting patients from abuse and preventing suicide.  </p>

<p>The right to die has been a contentious issue in the US. In 2016 the District of Columbia Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/dc-lawmakers-approve-death-with-dignity-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a "Death with Dignity" bill that would allow terminally ill patients to end their own lives with a physician's help. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-committee-votes-to-block-dc-death-with-dignity-act.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] by the House in February. Also in February Montana <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/montana-introduces-bill-to-allow-assisted-suicides.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would allow homicide charges to be brought against doctors engaged in physician-assisted suicide and would run against the current policy that allows life-ending options. In May the Nevada Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/nevada-senate-approves-physician-aid-in-dying-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a physician aid-in-dying bill.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal appeals court <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/17a0207p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that elected public board commissioners in a county in Michigan did not violate the US Constitution by opening their sessions with Christian prayer and asking attendees to join in. In a 9-6 decision, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] acknowledged that legislative prayer is part of traditions of the country and stated that plaintiff has not met his burden of proof to succeed in a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] claim. Judge Griffin, writing the majority opinion for the court, largely rejected plaintiff Bormuth's arguments and stated that "Bormuth has show he was offended by the Christian nature of the Board's prayers. But '[o]ffense...does not equate to coercion.'" Dissenting Judge Karen Moore wrote that the court overextends constitutional protection to excluding "non-Christians from the prayer opportunity and expresses disgust at people who voice a different opinion." The opinion comes in conflict with a recent decision made in July by an appeals court in Virginia which ruled a similar fact-pattern unconstitutional.</p>

<p>This case had <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-appeals-court-opening-public-meetings-with-only-christian-prayers-unconstitutional.php">originally been appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Sixth Circuit court for ruling on a summary judgment then remanded down for further proceedings. The Sixth Circuit court reclaimed the case to hear <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/en_banc">en banc</a> [LII backgrounder]. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2014  that the practice of opening town meetings with a prayer does <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-rules-prayer-allowed-at-town-meetings.php">not violate</a> [JURIST report] the First Amendment. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Mexico filed a <a href="http://www.nmag.gov/uploads/PressRelease/48737699ae174b30ac51a7eb286e661f/AG_Balderas_Files_Lawsuit_Against_Opioid_Manufacturers_and_Distributors.pdf">lawsuit</a> [press release and complaint, PDF] Thursday against big opioid producing pharmaceutical companies, alleging the corporations are responsible for the Opioid Epidemic flooding the state and specifically small rural communities. Filed in the <a href="https://firstdistrictcourt.nmcourts.gov/">First Judicial District Court for Santa Fe County</a> [official website], the lawsuit claims that major opioid manufacturers, including <a href="http://www.purduepharma.com/">Purdue Pharma</a>, <a href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson and Johnson</a>, <a href="http://www.endo.com/">Endo Health Solutions</a>, <a href="http://www.tevapharm.com/">Teva Pharmaceutical Industries</a> and <a href="http://www.actavis.ca/generics/en/default.htm">Actavis</a> [corporate websites], falsely represented and downplayed the highly addictive nature of the pain killers to Doctors. New Mexico <a href="http://www.nmag.gov/">Attorney General Hector Balderas</a> [official website] described the nature of the lawsuit:<blockquote>The manufacturing companies pushed highly addictive, dangerous opioids, falsely representing to doctors that patients would only rarely succumb to drug addiction, while the distributors breached their legal duties to monitor, detect, investigate, refuse and report suspicious orders of prescription opioids.</blockquote>Balderas initiated the lawsuit in an attempt to further New Mexico's effort to combat the opioid crisis through Project OPEN (Opioid Prevention & Education Network). The 132-page complaint calls out the relationship between prescription pain-killers and heroin overdoses, stating: "The CDC has identified addiction to prescription pain medication as the strongest risk factor for heroin addiction. People who are addicted to prescription opioid painkillers are forty times more likely to be addicted to heroin." This lawsuit makes New Mexico the eighth state to sue these major pharmaceutical manufacturers for the opioid crisis facing America. New Mexico's Mora County and Bernalillo County are currently in <a href="https://www.apnews.com/28c8c4e602b24d3fa96e1f82fe5293f8">litigation</a> [AP report] against opioid manufacturers, "seeking changes in marketing and prescription practices as well as cash to help cover costs." </p>

<p>This lawsuit is one of many efforts among state and federal government entities to fight the opioid crisis throughout the country. In July President Donald Trump's White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis <a href="/forum/2017/08/Hodge-Noe-opiate-epidemic.php">issued</a> [JURIST op-ed] its interim report calling for the President to immediately declare a national state of emergency in response to an epidemic that is devastating individuals and communities across the country. In June Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley filed a <a href="http://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2017/pdf/complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against opioid manufacturers <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/missouri-ag-suing-opioid-manufacturers.php">accusing</a> [JURIST report] them of violating consumer protection laws by deliberately and carefully crafting a "campaign of deception." Also in June Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-ag-sues-drug-manufacturers-for-fueling-painkiller-addiction.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Consumer-Protection/2017-05-31-Final-Complaint-with-Sig-Page.aspx">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against five major drug manufacturers for misleading marketing practices that led to a painkiller epidemic in the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/Paginas/default.aspx">Spanish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/NotasDePrensaDocumentos/NP_2017_062/P%204332-2017.pdf">suspended</a> [judgment, PDF, in Spanish] the Catalan independence referendum. The <a href="http://www.catalangovernment.eu/pres_gov/government/en/index.html">Catalan Parliament</a> [official website], the region's ruling coalition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/spanish-government-condemns-catalonia-over-independence-referendum">passed the referendum law</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] on Wednesday despite recent tensions between the coalition and the Spanish government. The rapid action taken by the court forbids the Catalan Parliament from ignoring or avoiding the court's suspension, appointing election officials, creating any record-keeping system for the referendum vote or taking any action geared towards promoting the referendum. The court also warned the Catalan Parliament of the potential criminal ramifications for failing to follow the court's order. Earlier Thursday, <a href="http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/presidente/biografia/Paginas/index.aspx">Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-court/spains-constitutional-court-suspends-catalan-referendum-law-court-source-idUSKCN1BI2TE">said</a> [Reuters report] that he asked the court to suspend the referendum, arguing that the Spanish Constitution states that the nation is "indivisible." The Catalan government has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/07/catalonias-independence-referendum-intolerable-act-disobedience/">stated</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] that they will press on despite the court's suspension. The court will now move to hear arguments concerning whether or not the referendum itself is unconstitutional. </p>

<p>The Catalonia independence movement has gathered momentum in recent years following the economic crisis in the country that began in 2008. In 2015 the Constitutional Court of Spain <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/spain-court-declares-catalonia-independence-plan-unconstitutional.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] a resolution by the Parliament of Catalonia that proposed a plan for the region's independence from Spain by the end of this year. In September of 2015 the High Court of Justice of Catalonia <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/catalonia-president-summoned-to-court-over-2014-independence-referundum.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia President Artur Mas over his involvement in the 2014 independence referendum. In 2014 Mas <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/catalonia-president-signs-decree-calling-for-referendum-on-independence-from-spain.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] calling for a referendum on secession and independence from Spain, inciting confrontation from Spain's central government in Madrid. In February 2014 Spain's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/spanish-parliament-rejects-catalonia-independence-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia's proposed referendum, which asked voters if they wanted Catalonia to become a state, and, in the case of an affirmative response, if they wanted this state to be independent. When Catalonia proceeded with the referendum, the Constitutional Court held the independence vote to be <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-top-court-declares-catalonia-independence-vote-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website]  <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/16/16-8083.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/compress/title06.docx">Wyoming Statute § 6-3-414(c)</a> and <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/compress/title40.docx">Wyoming Statute 40-27-101(c)</a> [text, DOC] are subject to First Amendment protections of free speech. The statutes, referred to as data-trespassing laws, define the crime of "civil trespass to access adjacent or proximate land" to occur if a person<blockquote>i) Crosses private land to access adjacent or proximate land where he collects resource data; and<br />
ii) Does not have:<br />
     (A)  An ownership interest in the real property or, statutory, contractual or other legal authorization to cross the private land; or<br />
     (B)  Written or verbal permission of the owner, lessee or agent of the owner to cross the private land.</blockquote><br />
The trial court had previously dismissed the challenge to the law after determining that it did not implicate free speech. The court of appeals found that section (c) implicates free speech because it would make it a crime to collect resource data, including taking photographs or writing notes on habitat conditions, on public lands if the person first trespassed on private property to reach the public property. The restriction applies directly to the creation of speech on public lands. Therefore, it is subject to the protections of the First Amendment. The trial court had also dismissed challenges to sections (a) and (b) of the same statutes, which refer to entering private land for the purpose of collecting resource data, and entering private land and collecting resource data, respectively. The court of appeals found that these two sections did not implicate free speech because the sections refer to conduct solely committed on private lands. The court of appeals remanded the case to the district court for a final decision on the constitutionality of the law.</p>

<p>The First Amendment protection of free speech is one of the most highly adjudicated constitutional rights. In August two civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/two-lawsuits-filed-challenging-trumps-transgender-military-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] lawsuits against President Donald Trump's transgender military ban, claiming in part that the ban violated their right to free speech. In November a Pennsylvania court <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-judge-denies-effort-to-allow-poll-watchers-in-pennsylvania.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that a law not allowing out-of-county poll watchers did not violate free speech. In October Airbnb <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/airbnb-sues-new-york-over-controversial-housing-regulation-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Senate Bill S6340A, which would have required Airbnb to screen and scrutinize every property, claiming it violated the company's free speech and due process rights. In July 2016, the Washington Supreme Court found an antibegging ordinance to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/washington-supreme-court-finds-antibegging-law-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] due to violations to the protection of free speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-111.html">filed</a> [docket list] an <a href="http://files.eqcf.org/cases/16-111-usa-amicus-brief/">amicus curiae brief</a> [text] with the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Thursday in support of the Masterpiece Cakeshop, which was charged with discrimination for refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, citing their religious beliefs against gay marriage. The DOJ stated that a "custom wedding cake is a form of expression" and "forcing [the baker] to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights." The brief states that the law should be subject to heightened scrutiny because it compels both creation of expression and participation in an expressive event. The brief also notes that at the time of the refusal to make the cake (July 2012), gay marriage was not legal in Colorado, thus showing that Colorado's law did not advance "a sufficient state interest to override petitioners' weighty First Amendment interest in declining to create the expression." The brief calls for the Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals of Colorado's decision that stated the petitioners' acts were discriminatory and the Colorado law was not barred by the First Amendment.</p>

<p>LGBT protections are still highly disputed in the US and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-court-lifts-injunction-on-controversial-mississippi-religious-objection-bill.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] an injunction on a Mississippi law that critics stated allowed those with "a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction" to discriminate against LGBT individuals. In May the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. Also in April the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/appeals-court-rules-lgbt-employees-protected-under-civil-rights-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that LGBT employees were protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Turkish court released a <a href="http://www.hdp.org.tr/">Peoples' Democratic Party</a> (HDP) [party website] parliamentarian Thursday, according to a HDP <a href="http://www.hdp.org.tr/tr/guncel/haberler/baydemir-bilgenin-tahliyesine-karar-verildi-olmasi-gereken-budur/10848">statement</a> [press release]. Parliamentarian Ayhan Bilgen is the former speaker of the HDP and has been jailed over allegations of terrorism. This release follows a "Conscience and Justice Watch" at the Constitutional Court to protest and <a href="http://www.hdp.org.tr/en/english/news/news-from-hdp/we-demand-conscience-and-justice/10826">demand action</a> [press release] for those they believed were unjustly and unlawfully imprisoned. The current Turkish government has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-kurds/turkish-court-orders-release-of-pro-kurdish-partys-former-spokesman-party-official-idUSKCN1BJ15C">removed and arrested</a> [Reuters report] more than 150,000 people after a failed coup last year.</p>

<p>Turkey has faced significant political upheaval in recent months as many worry over human rights in the country. In July a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/turkish-court-detains-six-human-rights-activists.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that six human rights activists, including Amnesty International's Turkey Director, remain in custody pending trial for allegedly aiding an armed terrorist group.

In April Turkish authorities <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-removes-3900-from-civil-service-positions-on-alleged-terrorist-links.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] more than 3900 people from their positions in the civil service and military pursuant to a new national security law published.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Guatemalan congressional committee on Sunday recommended that President Jimmy Morales' immunity should be voided so the attorney general and the UN can investigate illegal campaign financing allegations. According to the attorney general and head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> [official website], Morales <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">misappropriated</a> [JURIST report] over $800,000 from his 2015 campaign The recommendation to void immunity will be forwarded to Congress, and a final vote is expected next week. At least a two-thirds majority is needed to lift immunity. Morales continues to deny all allegations of illegal funding of his 2015 campaign.</p>

<p>Guatemala has a history of political scandal. In August Guatemala's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">blocked the expulsion</a> [JURIST report] of the lead UN anti-corruption official after Morales ordered his expulsion, alleging the official misused his authoritative position. On that same day, Morales fired the foreign minister for failure to execute the order and replaced him another who is currently under investigation for illegal adoptions. Former president Otto Pérez Molina and ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti were <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/guatemala-ex-president-accused-of-corruption.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of taking nearly 130 million in bribes in the beginning of 2011 by Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana. In August 2015 the Guatemalan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach Molina after he announced his intent to not resign after the scandal broke. In October, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-office-welcomes-new-guatemalan-draft-bill-on-constitutional-justice-r.php">welcomed a draft bill</a> [JURIST report] on constitutional justice reforms in the Guatemala legislature, which "represents an historic opportunity to consolidate the remarkable progress the country has achieved in the fight against impunity and corruption in recent years." In June a Guatemalan judge who served as general secretary for Guatemala's soccer federation <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/guatemala-judge-pleads-guilty-in-fifa-fraud-case.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to fraud and conspiracy in the FIFA scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="https://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/60684A25572B41E2C12581980037F253?OpenDocument">called</a> [press release] the situation in Myanmar "a textbook example of ethnic cleansing" at the opening of the UN Human Rights Council's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22035&LangID=E">36th regular session</a> [press release] Monday.</p>

<p>During his oral presentation, Zeid addressed a lack of consistency in human rights policies, EU nonuniform voice in global human rights, and specifically addressed issues in several countries.</p>

<p>According to Zeid, in Myanmar, there is another brutal security operation being conducted in Rakhine State with blatant disregard for international law. Those same forces and local militias are burning Rohingya villages. In less than three weeks, more than 270,000 people fled to Bangladesh. However, authorities are placing landmines along the border. India is implementing measures to deport Rohingyas; about 40,000 Rohingyas have migrated to India with only 16,000 of them receiving refugee documentation. India has also opposed engagement with the human rights office and instead encouraged ill-treatment of minorities. </p>

<p>Zeid also noted that last month in Venezuela there was a report of security forces using excessive force against anti-government protestors. In Turkey, the human rights effort is deteriorating as freedom of speech and information access is being restricted.</p>

<p>Zeid also voiced concern about President Donald Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, stating that it has had a positive impact on young migrants.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives authorities suspended 56 lawyers on Monday for signing and trying to submit a petition to the Supreme Court calling to uphold the rule of law. The petition cited court violations primarily in cases against opposition politicians. The Department of Judicial Administration (DJA) deemed the petition to be an unlawful document because it interfered with the judicial system by overstepping the system's procedures and rulings. The suspension <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/maldives-suspends-56-lawyers-who-cited-violations-by-courts/2017/09/11/c7e67a3c-96d4-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html?utm_term=.16ccbdf1ce18">applies</a> [AP report] to one-third of the lawyers in practice in Maldives, and the DJA offered no opportunity for a hearing. Former Attorney General <a href="http://suoodanwar.com/people/husnu-al-suood/">Husnu al-Suood</a> [materials], who now heads the private Maldives Lawyers' Association, was among those suspended. He said that the lawyers plan to challenge their suspension.</p>

<p>The Maldives government has generated significant controversy in recent years. Since coming to power in November 2013, Maldives <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=171">President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom</a> [official profile] has led a crackdown on political dissent. Last October Yameen signed into law a controversial bill criminalizing defamation with fines and jail terms despite widespread criticism. The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye issued a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-warns-against-controversial-freedom-of-expression-bill-adopted-in-the-maldives.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] condemning the bill approved by the Maldives parliament. In October 2014 the UN Office of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-office-condemns-maldives-prosecution-of-human-rights-commission-members.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the Supreme Court's prosecution of five members of the <a href="http://www.hrcm.org.mv/Homepage.aspx">Maldives' Human Rights Commission</a> [official website]. In February 2014 the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers found that lawyers and judges in the Maldives are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-maldives-judges-lawyer-facing-outside-pressure.php">not adequately independent</a> [JURIST report] from outside influence and called for a separation of powers between the parliament and court system. In November 2013 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/maldives-high-court-delays-presidential-election-for-third-time.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the nation's presidential election for the third time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of legal experts for the Polish Parliament <a href="http://www.sejm.gov.pl/Sejm8.nsf/komunikat.xsp?documentId=CBB89BA533005828C1258198002C838E">concluded</a> [press release, in Polish]y Monda that Poland is entitled to seek reparations from Germany over any acts committed by the country during the Second World War. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sejm.gov.pl/media8.nsf/files/KKOI-AR4BMR/%24File/1455%20-%2017PL.pdf">report</a>[text, PDF, in Polish] relies on various conventions, including the 1907 Hague Convention and the practice of reparations following WWII, to justify its claim. </p>

<p>Polish <a href="https://www.premier.gov.pl/en/people/beata-szydlo.html">Prime Minster Beata Szydło</a> [official website] has publicly <a href="http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/324733,Poland-deserves-WWII-reparations-PM">stated</a> [Radio Poland] that Poland "has the right to seek" reparations but has not committed to country to pursuing the action to this point. This was met in stark contrast to German legal experts who have recently denounced any legal basis for Poland to seek reparations. The issue boils down to the legality of the then 1950 Communists Government in Poland which relinquished all claims to reparations. </p>

<p>The ruling party in Poland has been attempting large shifts to the basic functions of its government over the past months. As recently as July the Polish President Andrzej Duda <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/polands-president-vetoes-judicial-reforms.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he was going to veto two proposed laws that threatened to limit the judiciary's independence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Google appeals EU antitrust fines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google appealed its EU antitrust fine on Monday after Intel's <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/eu-top-court-orders-reexamination-of-antitrust-fine-against-intel.php">partial victory</a> [JURIST report] last week against a similar EU sanction. Google's appeal comes two months after the <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/eu-fines-google-242-billion-for-antitrust-violation.php">initial</a> [JURIST report] antitrust fine by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] for abusing its "dominance in general internet search" to unfairly promote its shopping service instead of promoting Google Shopping on its merits. Google gave its Google Shopping prominent placement in its own search results and subsequently demoted the placement of other similar services, and the Commission deemed the company's actions to be illegal. While Google's case differs from Intel's, Intel's judgment  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-google-antitrust/google-challenges-record-eu-antitrust-fine-in-court-idUSKCN1BM1LJ">raised the bar</a> [Reuters report] for the EU to prove wrongdoing.</p>

<p>High-profile antitrust litigation has been an ongoing concern in 2017. In May EU antitrust regulators fined Facebook $122 million for <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/eu-fines-facebook-for-misleading-regulators-on-whatsapp-deal.php">misleading information</a> [JURIST report] regarding a deal for WhatsApp. In February the National Collegiate Athletic Association and 11 conferences agreed to a $208.7 million <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/ncaa-and-conferences-agree-to-2087-million-settlement-in-antitrust-suit.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action suit brought by former college athletes alleging their scholarships were illegally capped. In January a US federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-apple-antitrust-suit-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that plaintiffs may sue Apple for violating antitrust regulations by forcing users to purchase apps exclusively through their app store.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Justice Anthony Kennedy issued an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/17A275-Trump-v.-Hawaii-Temp-Stay-Resp-Order-9-11-17.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] Monday staying a lower court ruling, allowing enforcement of the Trump administration travel ban against refugees.</p>

<p>The Justice Department had filed an emergency <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/17A275-Trump-v.-Hawaii-App.-Stay.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] to block a Ninth Circuit <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/09/07/17-16426%20Opinion%20Filed.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that would have exempted refugees from the ban.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit weighed in on what constitutes a bona fide relationship, in accordance with a previous Supreme Court order in relation to the travel ban. The appeals court ruled that those who have a relationship with a resettlement agency should be exempt from the court order, dealing a blow to the defined terms that the administration have been seeking. The Ninth Circuit decision was set to go into effect Tuesday if the Supreme Court had not acted. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has already ruled on certain aspects of the executive order, including affirming part of a decision from the Ninth Circuit in July, which <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/supreme-court-exempts-grandparents-from-enforcement-of-travel-ban.php">exempts</a> [JURIST report] grandparents from the travel ban. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments from both sides, having decided to take the 9th Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-hawaii/">case</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on appeal in the upcoming session.

		<title>California files lawsuit to challenge DACA rescission</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California filed a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/DACA%20Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday against the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">US Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website], alleging the rescission of the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [USCIS materials] program  is unconstitutional. The complaint alleges that DACA's rescission violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection clauses, along with other allegations including violations of federal laws. The 37-page complaint emphasizes the benefits and purposes of DACA, stating in part:<blockquote>According to the DACA Memorandum, DACA's purpose was to ensure that resources were appropriately allocated to individuals who were higher priorities for immigration enforcement, recognizing among other things that young people brought here as children lacked the intent to violate the law. DACA recognizes that there are "certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home" and that immigration laws are not "designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language."</blockquote>California was joined in the lawsuit by Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. </p>

<p>California is not the first state to file suit over DACA's rescission. Last week, a group of 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/states-file-lawsuit-over-trump-administration-decision-to-eliminate-daca.php">lawsuit</a> challenging the Trump administration's <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/trump-administration-to-eliminate-daca-program.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] to end the Obama-era DACA program. California <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/about">Attorney General Xavier Becerra</a> [official profile] filed a separate action than that of the other 15 states because one of every four DACA participants lives in California. The Trump administration's decision to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/04/politics/daca-dreamers-immigration-program/index.html">disband</a> [CNN report] DACA will affect nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants. No new undocumented immigrants may register under DACA, and the immigrants whose DACA documents are about to expire must renew by October 5, 2017. According to the administration's press release, current DACA recipients generally will not be impacted until after March 5, 2018, which will give "Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brizillian billionaire Joesley Batista, owner of <a href="http://jbssa.com/">JBS</a> [corporate website], and executive Ricardo Saud surrendered to police on Sunday in Sao Paulo for allegedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-jbs/brazilian-billionaire-joesley-batista-surrenders-to-police-idUSKCN1BL0MF">withholding evidence</a> [Reuters report] during their plea bargain negotiation in the corruption case against <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Temer">President Michel Temer</a> [Britannica profile]. Batista is accused of making "a secret recording of Temer in May which the president apparently admitted paying bribes to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41222400">influential Brazilian politicians</a>"  [BBC report]. Justice Fachin revoked immunity granted to Batista and Saud through the plea bargain, and ordered their arrest for a minimum of five days for failing to proffer all information related to crimes they confessed to in the plea bargain. </p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times during which former presidents have been caught in <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-federal-police-find-evidence-of-president-receiving-bribes.php">scandals</a> [JURIST report] of receiving various bribes from various businesses. Brazil Attorney General Rodrigo Janot filed <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/noticias-pgr/pgr-denuncia-michel-temer-e-rodrigo-loures-por-corrupcao-passiva-1">charges</a> [press release, in Portuguese] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-president-charged-with-corruption.php">against Temer</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-president-charged-withcorruption.php">passive corruption</a> [JURIST report].Former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April, a <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verPrincipal.php?idioma=en_us">Brazil Supreme Court</a> [official website] justice ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. Last August Brazil's Senate voted to convict Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff on <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">charges</a> [JURIST op-ed] that she used improper accounting to cover-up a growing budget deficit and illegal loans from state-owned banks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] reached a unanimous decision on Monday to <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12983.doc.htm">adopt a US-drafted resolution</a> [press release] imposing a series of fresh new sanctions on North Korea. Among other things, these sanctions include a ban on the supply, sale or transfer of all natural gas liquids and condensates and exports of textiles, a preliminary three-month ban on direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of all refined petroleum products beyond 500,000 barrels and a one-year ban beyond two million barrels, and a ban on all refined petroleum products. The sanctions also extend some of the existing sanctions, which call for the freezing of the assets of certain individuals and entities. Additionally, these sanctions call for the freezing of an additional individual's assets and those of three additional entities, a travel ban on these entities, and a prohibition on member states in regard to the provision of work authorization to North Korean nationals. In adopting the resolution, the Security Council strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear test earlier this month urging the country to "immediately suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner." US representative Nikki Haley warned to "stop it ourselves" if North Korea does not end its nuclear and ballistic missile programs stating that "Half measures against the regime have not worked." UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary General António Guterres</a> [official website] welcomed the resolution <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57495#.Wbf2QsiGPIV">stating</a> [UN News Centre report] that "This firm action by the Security Council sends a clear message that the DPRK must comply fully with its international obligations. Many countries including UK, France and Japan praised the resolution, while China hoped that the US would not use this as an opportunity to dispatch its military and change the Pyongyang regime</p>

<p>North Korea's actions toward nuclear capability have alarmed many countries around the world in recent months, and the US has viewed such actions as persistent provocation. The last time the UNSC slapped sanctions on North Korea was barely three months ago in June when it <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-security-council-passes-sanctions-against-individuals-and-groups-to-north-korea-sanctions-list---.php">decided to expand</a> [JURIST report] existing sanctions placed on North Korea and applied those sanctions to 14 individuals and four organizations. In May, JURIST Guest Columnist and former human rights officer of the US <a href="https://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] James P. Rudolph <a href="/hotline/2017/05/James-Rudolph-north-korea-nukes.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the consequences of waiting for North Korea to use its nuclear weapons. Only two days earlier, North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-missile-test-strains-unification-measures.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] a short range missile, creating strain in the reunification efforts with South Korea. Earlier the same month, <a href="http://www.president.go.kr/">Moon Jae-in</a> [official website], sworn in as the nineteenth president of South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/new-south-korea-president-seeks-international-assistance-against-north-korea-weapons-threat.php">sought international assistance</a> [JURIST report] with North Korean weapons threats. In February, Japan <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> [official website] and US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] appeared in a joint press conference in Palm Beach, Florida, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/international-community-condemns-north-korea-missile-test.php">strongly condemning</a> [JURIST report] a North Korean ballistic missile test.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/index.php">Congress of Guatemala</a> [official website, in Spanish] voted Monday against lifting immunity for President Jimmy Morales over allegations of illegal campaign financing.This development comes just after a Guatemala congressional committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/guatemala-congressional-panel-recommends-lifting-presidents-immunity.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that Morales' immunity be voided to pave the way for an investigation into the matter by the country's attorney general and the UN. According to the attorney general and head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> [official website], Morales <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">misappropriated</a> [JURIST report] over $800,000 from his 2015 campaign. Julio Ixcamey, head of a five-member commission entrusted with the examination of the case, had stated on Monday that there was some evidence of unregistered campaign funds, but none linking Morales directly. Morales has thus far denied any wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.oj.gob.gt/">Guatemala Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled that legislators must review a request to lift Morales's immunity from prosecution, after finding that that <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/guatemala-congressional-panel-recommends-lifting-presidents-immunity.php">there was sufficient evidence</a> [JURIST report] to transfer the case to Congress. It was after this ruling that the five-member commission was formed to review the case and vote on the matter. Prior to that ruling, in late August, the <a href="http://cc.gob.gt/">Guatemala Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order blocking the expulsion of Ivan Velasquez, the head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG), within hours of the expulsion. Morales claimed that Velasquez misused his authoritative position by pressuring the legislative process and publicly accusing Guatemalans of violations without respecting their due process rights. However, according to a spokesperson for the US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [press release], Velasquez has acted as the lead in efforts to combat corruption and impunity in Guatemala for a decade. Soon after the expulsion order, US, Germany, Canada, Spain, France, UK, Sweden, Switzerland and the EU issued a joint statement condemning Morales's actions. Citizens, in protest of Morales, declared a state of siege in the capital, and some ministers resigned. Since the action to lift Morales's presidential immunity failed to attain the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/guatemala-congress-rejects-lifting-morales-immunity-170912005603670.html">required two-thirds or 105 votes</a> [Al Jazeera report], it is now considered suspended and can be reconsidered in a subsequent session of Congress. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The Neubrandenburg state court announced on Tuesday that it is ending the trial of former SS medic Hubert Zafke after experts determined he is unfit to stand trial because of his dementia. Zafke, 96, was <a href="http://gazette.com/german-court-ends-auschwitz-trial-cites-defendants-health/article/feed/492065">charged</a> [AP report] with 3,621 counts of accessory to murder during his one month at Auschwitz. The trial, which was supposed to start in February 2016, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-begins-trial-of-95-year-old-former-ss-medic.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until the following September because the defendant had been determined unfit to stand trial due to medical problems. The trial was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/trial-of-auschwitz-medic-postponed.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] again in October because the prosecutors alleged that the judges were biased. Three judges were removed in June due to bias.  </p>

<p>German courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. A court in Kiel, Germany, ruled in September 2016 that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes is <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-rules-92-year-old-woman-unfit-to-stand-trial-for-auschwitz-deaths.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. In 2014 German authorities imprisoned Oskar Groening, known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," who was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. In 2015 Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he said he would <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Beijing <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/Judiciary/31280.htm">intermediate court</a> [backgrounder] sentenced two brothers to life in prison on Tuesday after ruling that the brothers' peer-to-peer lending company, Ezubao, was a Ponzi scheme. One of the brothers, Ding Ning, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/09/12/world/asia/12reuters-china-fraud.html?mcubz=0">founder</a> [Reuters report] of the company and chairman of the Anhui Yucheng Holdings Group. His crimes included illegal fundraising and "smuggling precious metals." The Ponzi scheme collected the equivalent of over USD $9 billion from nearly one million investors, making it "close to one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in modern Chinese history." Twenty-five others involved in scheme were also arrested for up to 15 years.  </p>

<p>In January China's President Xi Jinping <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/china-president-plans-to-strengthen-anti-corruption-campaign.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that the nation's battle against corruption "must go deeper," stressing the need for the Communist Party to be governed "systematically, creatively and efficiently." That month a former China Nation Petroleum general manager was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/former-china-national-petroleum-general-manager-sentenced-to-15-years-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 15 years in prison for corruption. In December the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-to-prosecute-ex-security-official.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will prosecute Ma Jian, a former vice minister of China's Ministry of State Security, on bribery charges. That same month, the Chinese government also <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/federal-prosecutor-charges-foreign-hackers-for-stealing-law-firm-info.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Iat Hong and Chin Hung of Macau, and Bo Zheng of China on cybersecurity allegations. In October 2015 a former chairman of CNPC was sentenced to 16 years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/former-china-oil-firm-chairman-jailed-for-corruption.php">corruption</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australia's Coalition Party on Tuesday released a proposed bill to add extra protections to a same-sex marriage postal survey mailed out to the general public. The survey asks the public to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/vilification-or-intimidation-during-same-sex-marriage-survey-could-carry-12600-fine">vote</a> [Guardian report] on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized, and all completed surveys must be sent back to the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> [official website] by November. During that voting period, under the proposed bill, vilifying, intimidating or threatening voters based on their sex, religion or personal views will be a punishable offense. The bill also prohibits any actions that may interfere with survey responses. Such punishable offenses may be subject to civil penalties, up to $12,600, or even court-ordered injunctions. Attorney General <a href="http://">George Brandis</a> [official profile] will have the power to veto lawsuits enforcing civil penalties and appear in cases regarding injunctions. Furthermore, communications regarding the postal survey will require authorization, and the media will be required to give equal opportunity for both sides of the national debate to express their views. The bill still requires approval from parliament before it can be put into action. </p>

<p>Same-sex marriage has become one of the most controversial issues in the recent past with the marriage equality movement making significant waves in the past two years. Last week, Australia's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/australia-high-court-allows-same-sex-marriage-survey-vote.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to the postal survey which was brought forth by proponents of marriage equality and concerned the $122 million appropriated for the purpose of the mail-in ballot. Last month, Chile President <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidenta/">Michelle Bachelet </a> [official profile, PDF] introduced a <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chile-president-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex marriage. Bachelet said, "We believe that it is not ethical or just to place artificial limits on love or deny essential rights based solely on the sex of the partners." In July, Malta <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/malta-becomes-latest-country-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage. That same month, the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/uk-supreme-court-awards-equal-pension-rights-to-same-sex-spouse.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] equal pension rights to same-sex spouses. In June, the lower house of the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/germany-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 393-226 to legalize same-sex marriage. In April, Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against "unlawful assembly" and the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/europeanunionwithdrawal.html">European Union (Withdrawal) Bill</a> [official summary] passed by 326 votes to 290 after a <a href="http://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-09-07/debates/DA3CC146-F8AB-40FF-812B-FE2CADDEA2F4/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Bill">lengthy debate</a> [official summary] and allows for the continuation of Brexit despite the recent <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/uk-prime-minister-calls-for-early-election.php">election</a> [JURIST report] change.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/">council of Iraq</a> [official web site] on Tuesday <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/2017/09/12/24990/">denied</a> [official summary, Arabic] the referendum petition of Kurdistan to permit its independence. The council voted to keep Kurdistan in its region despite its <a href="/forum/2014/08/michael-kelly-kurdistan-promise.php">ongoing tensions</a> [JURIST op-ed] to maintain the region's stability.<blockquote>The Council decided the following: Rejection of the referendum to be held within the borders of the Kurdistan region and beyond the borders of the province and in all the disputed territories, including Kirkuk and oblige the competent authorities to take the necessary to cancel it. The Iraqi government has the responsibility to maintain the unity of Iraq and to take all measures and decisions that guarantee the preservation of Iraq's unity. To oblige the federal government and the territorial government to begin serious dialogue to address outstanding issues under the constitution and the laws in force.</blockquote>Additionally the council found the referendum vote violates the Iraqi constitution as it may threaten the peace and civil unity. </p>

<p>The tension between Iraq and Kurdistan have continued for years resulting in the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/21/538608383/iraqi-kurds-schedule-independence-referendum-for-september">referendum vote</a> [NPR report]. In September the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-civilians-bearing-brunt-of-violence-in-iraq.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that civilians bear the brunt of the violence. Last August Human Rights Watch reported that Iraqi militias are <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/hrw-iraq-militias-recruiting-children-from-civilian-camps.php">recruiting children </a>[JURIST report] from at least one civilian camp of displaced persons in the region of Kurdistan. Earlier in the same month the UN issued a report detailing the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-report-details-terrible-atrocities-committed-by-isil-in-iraq.php">"terrible atrocities" </a>[JURIST report] committed by IS against the Yazidi people and other ethnic and religious groups in Iraq. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month marked a welcome trend in the Ukrainian conflict, with civilian deaths decreasing for the first time in three years, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/UAReport19th_EN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Tuesday by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website]. The report attributes the reduced violence to the "harvest ceasefire," which began in late June, while <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22049&LangID=E">cautioning</a> [press release] that "the ceasefire never fully took hold, with hostilities suddenly flaring and then easing." In addition to updated statistics related to the conflict, which has claimed at least 2,803 lives to date, the report includes new allegations that some conflict-related detainees may be facing ill treatment, solitary confinement, and torture. The OHCHR says that one development compounding their concerns about the ongoing conflict is the detention of business people by governments on both sides of the conflict, on charges of financing terrorism, stemming from payments made as "taxes" to armed groups who control the area. </p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July Amnesty International and Human Rights released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine have <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">subjected citizens to</a> [JURIST report] "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. In July the Security Service of Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/ukraine-says-russia-behind-recent-cyber-attack.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] a cyber attack on Russia and the Kremlin. The SBU stated that the hackers behind the attack are the same as those who conducted an attack on the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016. In May an Austrian man was extradited from Poland to Austria to <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/austrian-man-extradited-for-war-crimes-in-eastern-ukraine.php">face war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly killing civilians and surrendering troops while fighting for the Ukrainian army. A Ukrainian official said last January that the nation plans to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. In March 2015 the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/yemen-coalition-airstrikes-deadly-children">reported</a> [text] on Tuesday that five airstrikes launched by a Saudi-led coalition against Yemen in June amount to war crimes due to the indiscriminate killing of 26 children. In 2015, the coalition began unlawful airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen and violated numerous laws-of-war. More than 785 children were killed and 1,168 wounded in Yemen that year, and the UN had attributed 60 percent of those casualties to the coalition. The Saudi government had pledged to change its procedures and prevent further harm to civilians. According to HRW, however, civilians are still being harmed in the conflict and there has been no significant reduction in unlawful airstrikes. Regarding the five airstrikes in June, HRW made the following statement: <blockquote>These attacks show that coalition promises to improve compliance with the laws of war have not resulted in significantly better protection for children. This underscores the need for the United Nations to immediately return the coalition to its annual &#8220;list of shame&#8221; for violations against children in armed conflict. The UN Human Rights Council should respond to continuing violations by the Saudi-led coalition, Houthi-Saleh forces, and other parties to the armed conflict by creating an independent, international investigation into abuses at its September session.</blockquote> According to HRW, there should be no delay in beginning an international inquiry into the coalition's airstrikes. The coalition's Joint Investigation Assessment Team has yet to initiate any investigations. </p>

<p>The conflict in Yemen has resulted in <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">thousands</a> [JURIST report] of deaths since 2015, creating an ongoing concern for human rights. Last October, airstrikes led by the Saudi-led coalition <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/saudi-coalition-airstrike-kills-over-90-in-yemen.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] at least 90 prisoners and injured dozens more in the Zaydiyah district of the Red Sea port city of Hudaydah, Yemen. UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-experts-accuse-saudi-led-coalition-of-violating-law-in-yemen-attack.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] the October attack on a packed funeral hall in the Yemeni capital, which is currently under rebel control, accused the Saudi coalition last Thursday of violating international humanitarian law. Saudi Arabian led airstrikes on a funeral in Sana'a, Yemen's capital, <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-saudia-arabia-airstrike-on-funeral-apparent-war-crime.php">were</a> [JURIST report] an "apparent war crime," HRW said on the same day as it also called for a credible investigation.According to a report released in early October, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/reuters-us-pursued-arms-deal-with-saudi-arabia-despite-possible-war-crimes-implications.php">conducted</a> [JURIST report] a $1.3 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year despite warnings that such contribution to the country's activities could implicate the US for war crimes</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court allows Trump refugee travel ban</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a one-sentence <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/091217zr_h3ci.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] issued Tuesday afternoon, the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] blocked a <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruling in the matter of <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/general/cases_of_interest/17-15589%20per%20curiam%20opinion.pdf">Trump v. Hawaii</a> [opinion, PDF], thereby allowing the administration's travel ban to go into effect. The unsigned order from the court grants a request from the Trump administration to stay the decision of the Ninth Circuit as the case proceeds. The justices are expected to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Monthly-Argument-Calendar-OCT-2017.pdf">hear arguments</a> [docket, PDF] related to the case on October 10. </p>

<p>The order comes a day after Justice Anthony Kennedy <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/supreme-court-allows-enforcement-of-travel-ban-against-refugees.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] of the Ninth Circuit Court's decision, in response to an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/17A275-Trump-v.-Hawaii-App.-Stay.pdf">emergency application</a> [text, PDF] by the Justice Department. </p>

<p>Though claiming to serve the interest of national security, the travel ban has been widely criticized by organizations such as the <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/carrp">ACLU</a> and the <a href="https://www.nwirp.org/">Northwest Immigrant Rights Project</a> [advocacy websites] and has faced legal difficulties in court. The Trump administration policy restricts refugee and general travel from six predominantly-Muslim nations in the stated-interested of national security. Last month a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/ninth-circuit-questions-necessity-of-travel-ban.php">questioned</a> [JURIST report] the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration in a hearing over the executive order restricting immigration from certain countries.  In June the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against President Donald Trump and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. In July, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/federal-judge-expands-travel-ban-exemptions.php">expanded travel ban exemptions</a> [JURIST report], though the Supreme Court later <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/supreme-court-travel-ban-grandparents/index.html">allowed the ban to apply to refugees</a> [CNN report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge of the <a href="https://www.courts.state.nh.us/superior/">New Hampshire Superior Court</a> [official court] on Tuesday <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/nh-democratic-party-et-al-v-gardner-et-al-preliminary-injunction-1505216669.pdf">blocked</a> [order, PDF] <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/text/SB3/id/1476501">SB 3</a> [materials], a New Hampshire law that would have potentially imposed a fine or potential jail time if voters did not submit proof of residence within 10 days of registering to vote. The bill, which was signed into law on July 10, applied to first-time voters who sought to register to vote 30 days before a scheduled election. Failing to provide the requisite proof could result in penalties of $5,000 and a year in prison. The court noted that these penalties would serve as a "very serious deterrent on the right to vote, and if there is indeed a 'compelling' need for them, the Court has yet to see it." While the court blocked these penalties from going into effect, the remainder of the bill, that is the proof of residency requirement, will take effect as intended. </p>

<p>Voting rights and how voters are grouped and counted has become and increasingly important issue over the past year. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-wisconsin-partisan-gerrymandering-case.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to hear a Wisconsin gerrymandering case. Earlier in June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-affirms-order-finding-north-carolina-racial-gerrymandering.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting of Districts 1 and 12 was unconstitutional because the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In January the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. In April of last year the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/state-european-union-and-rule-law-poland-2017-sep-12_en">said</a> [press release] Tuesday that Poland must address actions it has recently taken to undermine its own judicial system and the independence of Polish judges. In July the <a href="http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/">Polish Parliament</a> [official website], under the control of the ruling <a href="http://pis.org.pl/">Law and Justice Party</a> (PiS) [party website, in Polish], <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/poland-passes-bill-to-allow-parliament-to-appoint-supreme-court-judges.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would allow the legislative body to appoint Supreme Court judges. In response, the EU initiated what is known as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/overview-law-making-process/applying-eu-law/monitoring-implementation-eu-directives/infringement-procedure_en#stages-of-an-infringement-procedure">infringement procedure</a> [materials] against Poland. The infringement procedure empowers the European Commission to" take legal action ... against an EU country that fails to implement EU law. The Commission may refer the issue to the Court of Justice, which, in certain cases, can impose financial penalties." The European Commission has now initiated the second step of the procedure, which requires the Commission to send a formal request to the country in question to comply with EU law. The Polish government has yet to file a response to the European Commission's request. The EU has stated that if Poland does not address its recent attempt to reform its judicial system, the EU may pursue charges against the country in an attempt to have fines imposed on Poland.</p>

<p>PiS has drawn ire from those in the international community for threatening democracy in Poland. In August Polish <a href="http://www.president.pl/en/">President Andrzej Duda</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/polands-president-vetoes-judicial-reforms.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] two proposed laws that threaten to limit the judiciary's independence. The Polish Parliament is currently attempted to pass modified versions of both vetoed laws. In August 2016 Polish prosecutors began an <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/poland-to-investigate-head-of-constitutional-tribunal.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal </a>[official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. In June of last year the European Commission issued a warning to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. That February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government </a>[press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. In December 2015 the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-officials-decline-prosecution-death-freddie-gray">announced</a> [press release] on Tuesday that it will be not pursue charges against the six Baltimore police officers for the death of Freddie Gray, finding there was insufficient evidence prove beyond a reasonable doubt that officers willfully violated federal civil rights. The DOJ conducted an independent investigation into Gray's death after Baltimore State's Attorney criminal charges against the officers were dismissed. The DOJ determined that the requirements of the relevant criminal statute, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242">18 USC § 242</a> [text], were not met, concluding that "although Gray's death is undeniably tragic, the evidence in this case is insufficient to meet these substantial evidentiary requirements ... and for the reasons explained ... this matter is not a prosecutable violation of the federal civil rights statutes." The DOJ further concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest and search Gray after he made eye contact with one the officers and immediately fled in an area known for drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Gray's arrest and death led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In May 2015 the state's attorney <a href="paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-indicted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">announced the indictment</a> [JURIST report] of six police officers on charges including murder and manslaughter for his death, which took place while in police custody. After three acquittals, the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/charges-dropped-against-remaining-officers-in-freddie-gray-case.php">charges were dropped</a> [JURIST report] against the three remaining officers. Shortly after Gray's death, <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">urged Baltimore police to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force. Also in 2015, amidst national concern about police behavior, the DOJ announced a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-20-million-funding-support-body-worn-camera-pilot-program">$20 million body camera grant</a> [press release] program that includes training, technical assistance and evaluation to accompany $17 million for local law enforcement agencies to purchase body-worn cameras. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, "Body-worn cameras hold tremendous promise for enhancing transparency, promoting accountability, and advancing public safety for law enforcement officers and the communities they serve."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked two lower court rulings that mandated the redrawing of Texas <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/091217zr2_ba7d.pdf">congressional</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/091217zr3_4g15.pdf">state legislative districts</a> [orders, PDF]. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Stephen Breyer would have denied the application for stay.</p>

<p>In August, the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/federal-court-invalidates-two-texas-congressional-districts.php">found</a> [JURIST report] Districts 27 and 35 invalid pursuant to the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=43&page=transcript">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. Texas' state legislative maps were struck on similar grounds.</p>

<p>No new districts will be drawn under Tuesday's orders until the Supreme Court makes a final ruling. Without the mandated order to redraw the districts, the 2018 elections will likely proceed as is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Ohio executed convicted killer Gary Otte Wednesday morning after the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/091217zr1_g314.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF] his request for a stay on Tuesday night. Otte was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-executes-man-convicted-of-killing-two-in-back-to-back-robberies/">sentenced</a> [AP report] to death in 1992 for the killing and robbing Robert Wasikowski and Sharon Kostura in Parma, Ohio. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] had <a href="https://supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2017/2017-ohio-7587.pdf">declined</a> [text, PDF] to hear an appeal regarding the death sentence two hours before the scheduled execution time. Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website], also denied Otte clemency. Otte was the second person in Ohio to be executed by lethal injection this year. Prior difficulties in obtaining the lethal injection drugs resulted in a three-year delay in Ohio in which no executions had taken place.</p>

<p>Numerous states have switched to the three-drug protocol, which uses midazolam as a sedative before administering a second drug to paralyze and stop breathing and a third drug to stop the heart. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. In February the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-delaying-ohio-exeuctions.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction that delayed executions. In December the Mississippi Supreme Court allowed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/mississippi-top-court-allows-challenge-to-lethal-injection-drug.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the use of the sedative. Also that month an inmate in Alabama coughed and struggled to breathe for <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/alabama-lethal-injection-execution-called-avoidable-disaster.php">13 minutes</a> [JURIST report] during the administration of midazolam, which death penalty opponents called an "avoidable disaster." The US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/">Glossip v. Gross</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] in 2015 that Oklahoma's use of midazolam as part of its lethal injection protocol <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-allows-use-of-alternative-lethal-injection-drug.php">does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Eighth Amendment ban on <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/cruel_and_unusual_punishment">cruel and unusual punishment</a> [LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Israel High Court of Justice</a> [Official website] <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/14/770/018/c29/14018770.c29.htm">ruled</a> [judgment, in Hebrew] Tuesday that a law exempting ultra-Orthodox Jews from compulsory military service is <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.811973">unconstitutional</a> [Haaretz report]. Israel has mandatory military service, but a 2015 law allowed the defense minster to grant exceptions from the draft to yeshiva students. The High Court ruled 8-1 that the law was unconstitutional because it discriminates between religious and nonreligous men who are eligible for the draft. The one dissent argued that not enough time has passed to determine if the law is unconstitutional. The decision of the court will not take effect for one year, giving lawmakers time to create a new draft law that does not discriminate. Proponents of the law have stated that the High Court's decision goes against Jewish decision. Menachem Moses, the head of the United Torah Judaism Knesset faction will be looking to enact a new law "to protect us from the arrogant rulings of the High Court."</p>

<p>Israel has seen on-going tensions related to gender, race, and religion in recent years. In June, a Jerusalem court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/israel-court-rules-airline-cannot-force-women-to-move-to-accommodate-men.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that airline employees cannot ask women to move seats to accommodate ultra-Orthodox Jewish men. Israel's Justice Minister <a href="http://ayeletshaked.co.il/">Ayelet Shaked</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/israel-appoints-first-woman-to-religious-court.php">confirmed </a>[JURIST report] that the country's Judicial Appointments Committee has approved the first female judge to a Muslim religious court in April. In March, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-agency-accuses-israel-apartheid.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Israel of establishing an apartheid regime against the Palestinian people. In July 2016, Israel's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/israel-parliament-passes-controversial-law-broadening-impeachment-powers.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a law that enabled the impeachment of legislatures for inciting racism or supporting armed struggle against the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [government website] on Tuesday passed a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/358169799/Charlottesville-Resolution-09-06-2017-pdf">joint resolution</a> [text], now awaiting President Donald Trump's signature, which condemns both the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the hate groups involved. The bipartisan joint resolution, which was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/congress-charlottesville-white-supremacy-white-house-donald-trump/index.html">approved</a> [CNN report] by the Senate on the previous day, acknowledges those affected by the mid-August events and explicitly rejects "white nationalists, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups." The resolution further labels the events "a domestic terror attack" and calls on Trump to condemn and address forms of hate. It also calls on <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] and federal agencies to properly investigate hate groups and report on hate crimes. The joint resolution follows Trump's controversial response to the Charlottesville violence, which did not place blame solely on any involved group and referred to some white nationalists as "very fine people."  While the joint resolution now heads to Trump for signature, the White House has yet to comment on the matter. </p>

<p>The "Unite the Right" rally took place in mid-August  to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the recently renamed Emancipation Park. The rally drew members of white nationalist groups who marched through the streets of Charlottesville Friday night carrying torches and chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. Counter-protesters clashed with these groups Saturday, and 34 were injured. In addition, two state troopers were killed Saturday when the helicopter they were using to monitor the protests crashed. On the following weekend, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/sessions-orders-federal-probe-into-charlottesville-violence.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a federal civil rights investigation into the events. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAKZPHC/">Pietermaritzburg High Court</a> [official website] of South Africa <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAKZPHC/2017/36.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Tuesday that the 2015 election of a faction loyal to South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, is invalid. Zuma loyalists took <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-politics/south-african-court-ruling-delivers-setback-to-zuma-allies-idUSKCN1BN21V">control</a> [Reuters report] of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu Natal province</a> [Britannica materials], the ancestral home of the president, in 2015 at a party conference after ousting former <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [official website] KwaZulu-Natal chairperson, Senzo Mchunu. Judge Jerome Mnguni read on behalf of the court the two-sentence <a href="https://www.enca.com/south-africa/catch-it-live-anc-factions-face-off-in-pmb-high-court">order</a> [video] that declared, "The eighth KwaZulu Natal provincial elective conference ... unlawful and void." Many speculate that Tuesday's ruling could further dissolve Zuma's support base, especially after Zuma narrowly survived a no-confidence vote last month in South Africa's parliament. The ANC is reviewing the decision before announcing their next steps.</p>

<p>Tuesday's setback adds to the South African president's lengthy history of legal trouble. In June a South African court <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2016/489.pdf">denied</a> [decision, PDF] Zuma's appeal of a prior <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-high-court-orders-review-of-783-corruption-charges-against-president-zuma.php">court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that he should face nearly 800 corruption charges. In April Zuma evaded <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-president-zuma-beats-impeachment.php">impeachment</a> [JURIST report] after the ANC reaffirmed its support for the president. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in March that he had ignored the order of the Public Protector to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/">House of Representatives of the Philippines</a> [official website] on Tuesday voted 119-32 to cut the annual budget of the <a href="http://198.23.173.74/chr/">Commission of Human Rights</a> (CHR) [advocacy website] down to 1,000 pesos, equivalent to USD $20. CHR originally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-rights/philippine-congress-backs-annual-budget-of-just-20-for-agency-probing-drugs-war-idUSKCN1BN1JV?il=0">requested</a> [Reuters report] a budget of 1.72 billion pesos for 2018, an increase from their 2017 budget of 749 million pesos. While the government initially proposed a budget of 678 million pesos, supporters of President <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/profile/">Rodrigo Duterte</a> [official profile] justified the more drastic cut by alleging that the government's money was being wasted on the unnecessary defense of criminals' rights. Human rights experts have criticized the cut, stating that the decision will prevent the Duterte administration from being held accountable for human right violations in the administration's "war-on-drugs." Without the proper funding, it is expected that the CHR will be unable to continue its investigations into the ongoing execution of criminal suspects. </p>

<p>The Philippines have been on the international spotlight ever since Duterte took office as the president. During Duterte's campaign last year, he had stated 100,000 people would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/rodrigo-duterte-links-150-judges-and-politicians-to-drugs-trade">die</a> [Guardian report] in his crackdown on crime. Last month, a group of UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-philippines-must-address-human-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of the Philippines to address reports of human rights violations that include threats against indigenous people, murder and the summary execution of children. Duterte promised the prior week to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/07/philippine-president-promises-escalating-war-on-drugs-despite-international-human-rights-concerns---.php">continue to escalate</a> [JURIST report] the war on drugs in his country despite international concern over human rights violations. Earlier in July Duterte asked Congress to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/07/philippines-president-asks-congress-to-extend-martial-law-until-end-of-year.php">extend</a> his <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/philippines-president-declares-martial-law-as-militants-invade-marawi-city.php">order of martial law</a> [JURIST reports] for the lower third of the country. Also in July the Philippines <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/">Office of the Ombudsman </a>[official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/07/former-philippine-president-to-be-charged-with-usurpation-because-of-botched-raid.php">announced plans to charge</a> [JURIST report] former Philippines president Benigno Aquino III for the botched "anti-terror" raid that led to what is known as the Mamasapano massacre in 2015. In June Philippine opposition lawmakers <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/06/philippine-lawmakers-petition-supreme-court-to-end-president-dutertes-martial-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court </a>[official website] to reject President Rodrigo Duterte's imposition of martial law. In April a lawyer <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/lawyer-files-icc-complaint-against-phillipines-president-over-alleged-death-squad.php">filed a complaint </a>[JURIST report] against Duterte accusing him of extrajudicial killings during his nationwide anti-drugs crackdown. In March the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">accusing the police of falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Brazil Supreme Court</a> [official website] authorized another investigation on Tuesday into possible corruption and money laundering by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36070366">President Michel Temer</a> [BBC profile]. Supreme Court Justice Luis Roberto Barroso stated that there is enough evidence believe it is "plausible" the president received bribes in exchange for favoring a company operating in the port of Santos. The decision to launch a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-ports/brazils-top-court-approves-new-graft-probe-of-president-temer-idUSKCN1BN2P0">new investigation is rooted</a> [Reuters report] from a wiretapped conversation of a former aide to the President who discussed the potential for bribes from a port operator. Should the investigation reveal incriminating information that leads to the prosecutor formally charging the president, Congress would have to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-top-court-authorizes-new-investigation-on-president/2017/09/12/ec431736-97f2-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html?utm_term=.b5d9eed75fdd">vote</a> [WP report] on whether the president should be put on trial. Two-thirds of deputies must agree to suspend Temer to be suspended until the end of the trial.</p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times during which former presidents have been caught in scandals of receiving various bribes from various businesses. Former president Dilma Rousseff was impeached for <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil Supreme Court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers and dozen of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. In May the Brazil Supreme Court authorized a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/brazil-top-court-authorizes-corruption-probe-into-president-temer.php">corruption probe</a> [JURIST report] into President Michel Temer and his alleged involvement with the bribery of a potential witness in a major corruption case. Former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was implicated in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">scandal</a> [JURIST report] warranting charges to filed against him, including most powerful politicians. In November lawyers for ousted former Brazil president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dilma-Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff </a>[Britannica profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">filed documents </a>[JURIST report] alleging current President Michel Temer took a large bribe. In June Brazil's top electorial court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-top-electoral-court-dismisses-case-that-could-have-ousted-president.php">dismissed a case</a> [JURIST report] against President Temer for alleged illegal campaign funding in his 2014 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coalition of rights groups, led by <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/ngos-identify-human-rights-abusers-corrupt-actors-sanctions-under-us-bill">called</a> [press release] on the US Departments of <a href="https://www.state.gov/">State</a> and <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/">Treasury</a> [official websites] Wednesday to use the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-114publ328/html/PLAW-114publ328.htm">Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act</a> [text] to sanction foreign citizens accused of human violations and corruption. The organization sent a letter to <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/267393.htm"> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</a> and <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin</a> [official websites] asking them to use the act against 15 individuals from Azerbaijan, Bahrain, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. </p>

<p>The list of individuals are public servants who range from former presidents to judges and police chiefs who are accused but not yet convicted of any violations. Human Rights First joined with dozens of other organizations listed in the letter believe these foreign persons committed acts of corruption human rights violations including torture and murder and would like the secretaries to  levy sanctions on their finances.<blockquote>"Global Magnitsky" is a potentially revolutionary tool. It allows the United States the ability to sanction the world's worst human rights violators and corrupt actors wherever they may be, putting them on notice that accountability knows no borders. Robust implementation of the Act has the potential to deter would-be kleptocrats and those that would use violence to silence dissent and maintain their grip on power, forcing these actors to think twice before committing their crimes. In short, the law positions the United States to take a leading role in the international community in combating impunity and protecting human rights defenders worldwide.</blockquote>The request comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/08/presidential-memorandum-secretary-state-and-secretary-treasury">presidential authorization</a> [press release] of the act.  The act was named in an honor of <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/moscow-court-postpones-posthumous-hearing-for-russia-whistleblower.php">Russian whistle blower Magnitisky</a> [JURIST report] who was murdered after producing evidence against the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/">Senator Bernie Sanders</a> (I-VT) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/17-senators-introduce-medicare-for-all-act">introduced</a> [press release] his "Medicare for all" bill. The <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-act?id=6CA2351C-6EAE-4A11-BBE4-CE07984813C8&download=1&inline=file">Medicare for All Act of 2017</a> [text, PDF], which is cosponsored by 16 democrats including 2020 front runners <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?433998-1/senator-sanders-unveils-medicare-bill">Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren</a> [CSPAN video stream] seeks to fundamentally change the American health care system to a <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-act-of-2017-executive-summary?id=943E7DB5-FCCA-4EA4-B215-A92F6642BA2C&download=1&inline=file">single-payer</a> [summary] plan. Under the bill, individuals would be given a benefits card that would allow them to have access to services including dental coverage and mental health treatment. The bill seeks to distinguish between basic, preventative health care needs and expansive coverage by creating plans with differing levels of coverage.  The bill would also prevent private insurers from selling duplicate coverage and charging increased rates for similar care. However, there is a possibility of increased out of pocket expenses to offset the cost of care, and the exact cost is unknown.</p>

<p>American healthcare implementation continues to be a contentious issue. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican, and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/bipartisan-group-of-governors-propose-plan-to-stabilize-healthcare.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Congress in September proposing a plan to preserve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to stabilize the healthcare market.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of individuals represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/Alasaad%20v%20Duke%20Complaint.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website] challenging the "searches and seizures of smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices" at the borders. The complaint alleges that such searches "absent a warrant supported by probable cause and without particularly describing the information to be searched" are a violation of the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf">First</a> and <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-5.pdf">Fourth</a> [text, PDFs] Amendments to the US Constitution. The plaintiffs in the case were ordinary citizens or permanent residents whose electronic devices were seized and searched, and in some cases were retained by federal authorities for months before being returned. The defendants in the case include the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS), <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) and <a href="http://www.ice.gov">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE). The crux of the complaint is that modern electronic devices hold massive amounts of personal information such as political or social opinions, and sensitive medical, legal and financial information. Additionally, electronic devices in this age carry a large number of intimate photographs and messages. Thus, the complaint alleges that:<blockquote>The volume and detail of personal data contained on these devices provides a comprehensive picture of travelers' private lives, making mobile electronic devices unlike luggage or other items that travelers bring across the border .... Because government scrutiny of electronic devices is an unprecedented invasion of personal privacy and a threat to freedom of speech and association, searches of such devices absent a warrant supported by probable cause and without particularly describing the information to be searched are unconstitutional.</blockquote>The complaint takes direct aim at CBP's <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cbp_directive_3340-049.pdf">2009 Directive</a> [text, PDF] titled "Border Searches of Electronic Devices Containing Information" and ICE's <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/ice_border_search_electronic_devices.pdf">2009 Directive</a> [PDF] titled "Border Searches of Electronic Devices," which allegedly authorize "warrantless and suspicionless searches and confiscations of mobile electronic devices." The complaint requests various forms of relief, including an injunction against further confiscation and searches, attorneys' fees and costs, a declaration that plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights were violated, and an injunction to force the government to "expunge all information gathered from, or copies made of, the contents of Plaintiffs' electronic devices, and all of Plaintiffs' social media information and device passwords."</p>

<p>Concern regarding searches and seizures of electronic devices at the borders is rising and lawmakers have recognized such concerns. In April, a group of US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/senators-introduce-bill-to-protect-citizens-electronics-from-border-searches.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a bipartisan bill to require government agents to get a warrant when searching electronic devices of US citizens at the border. Privacy in general has been a contentious topic around the world in the past two years. In June, Japan's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/japan-parliament-approves-controversial-counterterrorism-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a controversial "anti-conspiracy" bill aimed at improving security and combating terrorism that critics claim will violate privacy rights. In May, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/germany-court-allows-government-websites-to-save-user-data.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that government websites can store personal data as long as they provide adequate justification. The same month, the <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Senate/">Nevada Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/nevada-senate-approves-internet-privacy-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring Internet providers to disclose what types of personal information they collect from users. In April, JURIST Guest Columnist Andreas Kuersten <a href="/hotline/2017/04/Andreas-Kuersten-internet-consumer-privacy.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the flawed reasoning of a legislation signed earlier this year that allows Internet Service Providers to sell customers' personal information without their consent. Also in April, a group of US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/senators-introduce-bill-to-protect-citizens-electronics-from-border-searches.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a bipartisan bill to require government agents to get a warrant when searching electronic devices of US citizens at the border.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/Main.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp/who-s-who/Pages/Fatou-Bensouda.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=170913-otp-stat-libya">renewed her calls</a> [statement] to the Libyan government on Wednesday for the immediate arrest and surrender of Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf al-Werfalli, who is alleged to have participated in war crimes in Libya. Specifically, al-Werfalli is suspected of directly participating in seven incidents involving the deaths of 33 individuals. Stating that Libya has the primary responsibility to arrest al-Werfalli and surrender him to the custody of the ICC, Bensouda urged Libya authorities to "use all means in their reach to do so immediately." Bensouda expressed further concerns regarding conflicting reports about the arrest of al-Werfalli. On the one hand, the Libyan National Army (LNA) released an official statement saying that it has arrested al-Werfalli and has placed him under investigation. On the other hand, Bensouda said that she received directly contradictory reports of al-Werfalli being still at large and involved in additional killings. Bensouda expressed her grave concern about:<blockquote>these new allegations, and generally about further violent loss of life in Libya, irrespective of the status of the perpetrators or their affiliation. ... Mr al-Werfalli stands accused of serious crimes. I therefore again call on Libya to take all possible steps to immediately arrest and surrender him to the ICC. I also invite the LNA to demonstrate its stated support for the Court by working with the Libyan authorities to facilitate Mr al-Werfalli's immediate surrender to the ICC so that his guilt or innocence can be established before the Court's judges, with full respect for his due process rights.</blockquote>On a closing note, Bensouda also appealed all UN Member States, including those of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], to aid Libya in its efforts to arrest and surrender al-Werfalli to ICC without delay. </p>

<p>Last month, Bensouda issued her <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=170815-otp-stat">first statement</a> [text] calling for the immediate arrest and surrender of al-Werfalli, following the issuance of an arrest warrant. This statement reiterates that call. Libya has remained politically unstable since the 2011 deposition of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muammar-al-Qaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [Britannica profile] and <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">subsequent civil war</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In July the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/the-un-voices-concerns-over-imminent-threats-of-torture-in-libya.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] that the Libyan National Army has committed and will continue to commit summary executions of men that have been taken prisoner. In November Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/icc-to-significantly-expand-investigations-in-libya.php">informed</a> [JURIST report] the Security Council that the ICC wants to significantly expand investigations in Libya in 2017. The ICC <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/libya">began work</a> [ICC materials] in Libya in 2011 to investigate crimes against humanity, including murder and persecution. In September 2016 the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/KateGilmore.aspx">Kate Gilmore</a> [official profile], spoke on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-continuing-to-deteriorate.php">deteriorating human rights situation</a> [JURIST report] in Libya and called for accountability and reform. In May of last year <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-islamic-state-has-executed-dozens-in-sirte-libya.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Islamic State militants had executed 49 people in the Libyan city of Sirte since seizing control in February 2015. In February 2016 the UN released a report detailing a "litany of violations and abuses" being committed by both state and non-state actors in Libya that <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-report-libya-abuses-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/SupremeCourt.aspx">Minnesota Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Standard%20Opinions/OPA150005-091317.pdf">overruled</a> [opinion, PDF] part of a state disorderly conduct statute on Wednesday, saying that it violated the First Amendment because it is "overbroad." <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.72">Minnesota Statues  609.72, subd. 1(2)</a> [statute] makes it a crime for a person to disrupt a legally held assembly. The case was brought after defendant Robin Lyne Hensel appealed her conviction under the statute after she had silently protested at a City Council meeting and refused to leave when asked. The majority wrote, "Due to the countless ways in which [the statute] can prohibit and chill protected expression, we conclude that the statute facially violates the First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine." The dissent, agreeing with the state, wrote that the statute could be narrowly construed to prohibit only conduct not protected by the First Amendment.  </p>

<p>The First Amendment protection of free speech is one of the most highly adjudicated constitutional rights. Earlier this month the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/doj-urges-supreme-court-to-rule-for-baker-in-colorado-same-sex-wedding-cake-case.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the baker in a same-sex wedding cake case, evoking the First Amendment. Also in September a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/federal-appeals-court-rules-wyoming-data-trespassing-law-subject-to-first-amendment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Wyoming data-trespassing law was subject to the First Amendment. In August two civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/two-lawsuits-filed-challenging-trumps-transgender-military-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] lawsuits against President Donald Trump's transgender military ban, claiming in part that the ban violated their right to free speech. In November a Pennsylvania court <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-judge-denies-effort-to-allow-poll-watchers-in-pennsylvania.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that a law not allowing out-of-county poll watchers did not violate free speech. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Tunisian parliament, the <a href="http://www.arp.tn/site/main/AR/index.jsp">Assembly of People's Representatives</a> [official website, in Arabic], on Thursday adopted a law pardoning thousands of people who followed orders from corrupt leaders while hundreds protested the decision. Amnesty will only be granted to those who did not make money off of the corruption or if they pay back the money with penalties. The Tunisian people and international organizations have <a href="https://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/tunisia_new_law_granting_the_corrupt_amnesty_must_be_rescinded">condemned the law</a> [TI report] and count it as a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/23/law-could-be-final-blow-tunisias-transition">"final blow"</a> [HRW report] in the transition process from the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12196679">Ben Ali regime</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>

<p>Tunisia continues to face challenges after the Arab Spring uprising. Thousands of Tunisians in May <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thousands-protest-tunisia-corruption-amnesty-bill.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] the recently passed bill that would grant amnesty to officials facing corruption charges from a previous regime. A Tunisian court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/tunisia-court-sentences-uk-dj-to-prison-for-offending-public-morality.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] British DJ Dax J to a year in prison in April for public indecency and offending public morality after the artist played a remix of the Muslim call to prayer in a nightclub. In March German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/germany-and-italy-deport-suspected-terrorists-to-tunisia.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that a Tunisian man responsible for a deadly museum attack in Tunisia in 2015 will be deported. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13036732">Angola</a> [BBC backgrounder] Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed four opposition parties' challenge to the August 23 election in which one party gained over 60 percent of the popular vote. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Popular-Movement-for-the-Liberation-of-Angola">Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola party</a> (MPLA) [Britannica backgrounder] now <a href="http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/14/angola-top-court-dismisses-petition-against-august-23-polls/">holds</a> [Africa News report] 150 out of 220 seats in the nation's parliament. The court said that the election and recounts were "free, transparent, and fair."  This marks the MPLA's fourth victory in a row. Former Defense Minister Joao Lourenço's presidential inauguration will be on September 21. </p>

<p>Angola has enjoyed large economic growth and increased stability following the end of the nation-wide civil war in 2002. However it was unsuccessful in addressing problems such as corruption. In early 2010 Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-group-urges-angola-to-fight.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the government to increase its effort to fight corruption affecting the majority of its citizens who are not able to enjoy the improvements of the country. In January 2010 the parliament of Angola <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/angola-adopts-new-constitution.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution ending the popular election of the president and replacing the interim constitution that had been in place since 1975. In 2012 HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-urges-angola-to-respect-citizen-freedom-of-speech.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Angola to respect citizens' freedom of speech.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Last week the <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/Paginas/default.aspx">Spanish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/spain-constitutional-court-suspends-catalan-referendum.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the referendum and agreed to hear arguments to determine if it violates the Spanish Constitution which states that the nation is "indivisible." The prosecutor <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/spain-calls-catalan-mayors-for-questioning-on-independence-vote-idUKKCN1BO1JE?il=0">plans</a> [Reuters report] to charge officials who have been involved with preparations for the vote with civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds. Police are instructed to arrest those who do not respond to the summons and were given <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/spain-summons-catalan-mayors-independence-vote-170913153323027.html">additional orders</a> [Al Jazeera report] to seize flyers, ballot boxes and other items that could be used for the referendum. Regional government officials have 48 hours to show the Constitutional Court how they are preventing the referendum from happening. </p>

<p>The Catalonia independence movement has gathered momentum in recent years following the economic crisis in the country that began in 2008. In 2015 the Constitutional Court of Spain <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/spain-court-declares-catalonia-independence-plan-unconstitutional.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] a resolution by the Parliament of Catalonia that proposed a plan for the region's independence from Spain by the end of this year. In September of 2015 the High Court of Justice of Catalonia <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/catalonia-president-summoned-to-court-over-2014-independence-referundum.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia President Artur Mas over his involvement in the 2014 independence referendum. In 2014 Mas <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/catalonia-president-signs-decree-calling-for-referendum-on-independence-from-spain.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] calling for a referendum on secession and independence from Spain, inciting confrontation from Spain's central government in Madrid. In February 2014 Spain's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/spanish-parliament-rejects-catalonia-independence-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Catalonia's proposed referendum, which asked voters if they wanted Catalonia to become a state, and, in the case of an affirmative response, if they wanted this state to be independent. When Catalonia proceeded with the referendum, the Constitutional Court held the independence vote to be <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/spain-top-court-declares-catalonia-independence-vote-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/index.php">Congress of Guatemala</a> [official website] approved legislation that decreases the penalties for campaign finance crimes on Wednesday by a vote of 105-19. The reform <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-corruption/guatemala-lawmakers-curb-penalties-for-illegal-election-financing-idUSKCN1BP043">reduces</a> [Reuters report] the maximum sentence for illegally funding an election from 12 to 10 years, as sentence which can be commuted to a fine. Additionally, the law shifts the responsibility of financial irregularities from party leaders to accountants. Lawmakers called the vote a matter of "national urgency" and pushed it ahead of other issues that were scheduled to be decided upon. Critics of the changes see them as another attempt by Congress to protect President Jimmy Morales. Prosecutors sought to remove immunity from Morales in order to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">misappropriation</a> of over $800,000 in election funds but were <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/guatemala-congress-rejects-calls-to-lift-presidents-immunity.php">prevented from doing so by Congress</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this week. </p>

<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.oj.gob.gt/">Guatemala Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled that legislators must review a request to lift Morales's immunity from prosecution, after finding that that there was <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/guatemala-congressional-panel-recommends-lifting-presidents-immunity.php">sufficient evidence</a> [JURIST report] to transfer the case to Congress. It was after this ruling that the five-member commission was formed to review the case and vote on the matter. Prior to that ruling, in late August, the <a href="http://cc.gob.gt/">Guatemala Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/guatemala-court-blocks-presidents-expulsion-order-of-an-un-anti-corruption-official.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order blocking the expulsion of Ivan Velasquez, the head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website], within hours of the expulsion. Morales claimed that Velasquez misused his authoritative position by pressuring the legislative process and publicly accusing Guatemalans of violations without respecting their due process rights. However, according to a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [press release], Velasquez has acted as the lead in efforts to combat corruption and impunity in Guatemala for a decade. Soon after the expulsion order, US, Germany, Canada, Spain, France, UK, Sweden, Switzerland and the EU issued a joint statement condemning Morales's actions. Citizens, in protest of Morales, declared a state of siege in the capital, and some ministers resigned. Since the action to lift Morales's presidential immunity failed to attain the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/guatemala-congress-rejects-lifting-morales-immunity-170912005603670.html">required two-thirds or 105 votes</a> [Al Jazeera report], it is now considered suspended and can be reconsidered in a subsequent session of Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on the right to development <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/SRDevelopment/Pages/SaadAlfarargi.aspx">Saad Alfarargi</a> [official profile] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22065&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] on Thursday that escalating climate change and the global economic crisis are posing increasing threats to the world's impoverished persons. Alfarargi filed a <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G17/229/68/PDF/G1722968.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] with the UN Office of the High Commissioner in August in which he argued that the general negative impacts of the two converging crises are having the most dramatic impact on developing nations and the poor. Alfarargi focused his remarks on developing, landlocked nations and small islands. To combat these effects, Alfaragi is urging the UN, member organizations and grassroots organizations to focus on the "<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/Introduction.aspx">right to development</a>" [materials]. The right to development, as described by the UN, is an attempt by the international community to ensure that the environmental and economic needs of developing nations are met. Alfarargi argued that as the climate continues to change and natural resources become increasingly scarce, nations around the world should concentrate their efforts on protecting the right to development for all persons. By mandate of the UN, Alfarargi will continue to monitor and regularly report on the state of the right to development around the world for the next three years.</p>

<p>According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. In November, for the first time in history, governments around the world agreed to legally binding limits on global temperature rises as the Paris Agreement on climate change became <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/paris-agreement-on-climate-change-becomes-effective.php">effective</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement, 55 parties making up more than 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/paris-agreement-on-climate-change-achieves-threshold-for-entry-into-force.php">achieved</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Egyptian Supreme State Security Prosecution on Thursday acknowledged the detainment of Ibrahim Metwally, a human rights lawyer. Metwally was arrested three days prior after he was suspected of providing legal aid to the family of an Italian graduate student who abducted and killed by Egyptian forces while in Cairo in 2016. The <a href="http://www.ec-rf.org">Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] is calling on the government to release Metwally and to drop any and all potential criminal charges pending against him. Metwally has long argued against violations of human rights carried out by the Egyptian government, including its use of enforced disappearance technique, which experts argue is rampant in Egypt. </p>

<p>The Egyptian government has recently been accused of numerous human rights violations. Last week Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/hrw-egypt-security-forces-systematically-torture-political-detainees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that security forces under the administration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi have systematically used torture methods against political detainees that likely amount to crimes against humanity. Last month the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/un-rights-experts-express-concern-over-blocked-websites-in-egypt.php">issued a statement</a> [JURIST report] detailing their concern over websites, including many news sites, that have been shutdown or blocked by the Egyptian government. In June the UN stated that Egypt's new <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-high-commissioner-new-egypt-law-restricts-human-rights.php">NGO law</a> [JURIST report] will further restrict human rights advocacy. In May the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-egypt-security-measures-encouraging-radicalization.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the increased security measures the president has instituted since the bombings of Christian churches earlier this year. While condemning the attacks, al-Hussien said that al-Sisi's declaration of a three-month state of emergency was only going to increase radicalization. In April HRW <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-trump-meeting-with-egypt-president-ignores-rights-abuses.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] US President Donald Trump's plan to meet with al-Sisi, saying the move effectively endorses the country's poor recent human rights record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three former Google employees filed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4046635-Kelly-Ellis-Et-Al-v-Google-Inc-Complaint.html">lawsuit</a> [complaint] Thursday accusing the company of wage discrimination against women. Plaintiffs Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease and Kelly Wisuri filed the complaint as a class action lawsuit in California Superior Court in San Fransisco. The complaint alleges that Google "discriminated and continues to discriminate against its female employees by systematically paying them lower compensation" than male employees. Among other allegations, the plaintiffs accuse Google of violating the California Equal Pay Act. The complaint cites to the US Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs's (OFCCP) 2015 investigation of Google, stating:<blockquote>OFCCP's analysis showed six to seven standard deviations between pay for men and women in nearly every job classification in 2015. Two standard deviations is considered statistically significant; six or seven standard deviations means there is a one in 100 million chance that the disparity is occurring randomly or by chance.</blockquote>If class action is permitted, the plaintiffs will represent all women who have worked for Google since 2013. </p>

<p>Ending sex and gender discrimination in the workforce has been a political and legal battle throughout the last decade. In April the US Department of Labor <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/dol-accuses-google-of-systemic-gender-compensation-disparities.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Google of engaging in compensation discrimination against female employees. Also in April the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/04/27/16-15372.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that calculating salaries based solely on prior salaries does not violate the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm">Equal Pay Act</a> [text] even when it results in <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/appeals-court-rules-employers-can-use-prior-salary-to-justify-paying-women-less.php">women being paid less</a> [JURIST report] than men for the same job. The Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Oracle America, Inc. in January <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/labor-department-sues-oracle-for-employment-discrimination.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] that the company engaged in a systemic practice of paying their Caucasian male workers more than other employees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iraqi parliament voted to oust Kirkuk governor Najm al-Din Karim on Thursday amid rising Kurdish tensions over a planned <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/2017/09/12/24990/">independence referendum</a> [official summary, Arabic]. Following the <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/">council of Iraq's</a> [official website] vote against the referendum petition Tuesday, parliament authorized Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi to "take all measures" to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41269877">preserve national unity</a> [BBC report], which included dismissing the Kirkuk governor. Karim expressed his unwillingness to step down as governor and commitment to gaining independence, saying: "the referendum will go on as planned." For now, the referendum itself is still scheduled for September 25 and Kirkuk will have no vote on the matter.</p>

<p>Kikuk, under Bahdad's control and claimed by the Iraqi Kurdistan region, has long sought separation from Iraqi. The referendum, which is scheduled for vote on September 25, is part of Kirkuk's attempt to gain <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1152541/middle-east">independence from Iraq</a> [Arab News, report]. The council <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/iraq-votes-against-kurdish-independence-referendum.php"">voted</a> to keep Kurdistan in its region, thereby denying Kurds a vote on the referendum, despite its ongoing tensions [JURIST op-ed] to maintain the region's stability. The counsel also denied the petition for the reason that it was unconstitutional. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Tunisia's presidency spokeswoman, Saida Garrach, announced that the country's ban on Muslim women marrying non-Muslim men has come to an end. The prior law had required men to convert to Islam and submit a certificate of the conversion before they were allowed to marry Muslim women. The ban has been in place since 1973. The president of Tunisia, Beji Caid Essebsi, had previously called for the end to the ban last month. Essebsi had argued that the law violated the Tunisia Constitution that was enacted in 2014. The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/tunisia-lifts-ban-muslim-women-marrying-muslims-170914154657961.html">removal of the ban</a> [Al Jazeera report] is another step towards increased women's rights in the predominantly Muslim country. The country has been seen as being ahead of many other Muslim countries since the 1956 Social Code that outlawed polygamy and granting rights to women. </p>

<p>Tunisia <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/tunisia-assembly-opts-for-civil-law-over-shari-in-constitution.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] the constitution in 2014 amid what is now known as the Arab uprising. Tunisia has faced political turmoil since president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. In July 2013, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-assassination-of-tunisian-opposition-leader.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the assassination of Tunisian opposition leader. In May 2013 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Tunisia to modify its <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-tunisia-should-modify-draft-constitution-to-protect-human-rights.php">draft constitution</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protection of human rights. Two months earlier HRW urged Tunisia to repeal its <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-tunisia-to-repeal-criminal-defamation-law.php">criminal defamation law</a> [JURIST report], which is typically considered a civil offense throughout the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/">California State Legislature</a> [official website] <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB2">passed</a> [vote record] <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB2">SB 2</a> [text], an affordable housing bill. The bill enacts a $75 fee "to be paid at the time of the recording of every real estate instrument, paper, or notice required or permitted by law to be recorded, per each single transaction per single parcel of real property, not to exceed $225." The funds recovered by the fee will be used for affordable housing. The fee will not be imposed on "any recording made in connection with a sale of real property." Funds collected in 2018 will be evenly divided between local governments and the Department of Housing and Community Development. Local governments will use the funds to streamline housing production, and the Department will use the funds to assist those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Twenty percent of funds collected after 2018 will be used for affordable owner-occupied workforce housing, while the remaining funds will be sent to local governments. </p>

<p>California has been experiencing a housing crisis for many years. The median cost of a house is $500,000, making housing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/california-housing-crisis.html?mcubz=0">unaffordable</a> [NYT report] for many. It has resulted in many having very long commutes in order to get to work. Homelessness in the state has also increased significantly in recent years, with Sacramento County seeing an<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article160423019.html"> increase of 30%</a> [Sacramento Bee Report] of homelessness between 2015 and 2017. They have also been reports of many living in vans with makeshift kitchens or in recreational vehicles. <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB3">SB 3</a> and <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB35">SB 35</a> [Text] were also passed on Thursday to combat unaffordable housing. SB 3 provides $4 billion on bond funding for low-income home building and home loans for veterans. SB 35 is meant to help streamline the approval process for affordable housing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A St. Louis, Missouri, circuit judge on Friday <a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/7b/57b2d12c-83d8-53a0-ba1f-18b659a7e569/59bbe0a450230.pdf.pdf">acquitted</a> [ruling, PDF] a former police officer accused of first degree murder for the shooting of a black man. Jason Stockley was pursuing Anthony Lamar during a high-speed chase when evidence post-chase becomes inconclusive according to the court. <a href="http://www.stlcitycircuitcourt.com/index2.html?XMLFile=xml/judges/Wilson.xml">Judge Timothy Wilson</a> [official profile] stated that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proof. "This Court, as trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant's guilt. Agonizingly, this Court has poured over the evidence again and again ... This Court, in conscience, cannot say that the State has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense."</p>

<p>Tensions have risen further around the country since the Ferguson rioting. In August US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/trump-administration-expected-to-lift-military-gear-ban.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that will lift an Obama-era directive that restricted local police agencies' access to military equipment. In May a Tulsa police officer was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/tulsa-police-officer-who-fatally-shot-terence-crutcher-acquitted.php">found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of shooting an unarmed black man. Earlier in May the Dallas County Sheriff's Department <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/police-officer-charges-with-murder-of-15-year-old-jordan-edwards.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former Police Officer Roy Oliver over the murder of Jordan Edwards, a young black man.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Office of the Attorney General of Indonesia <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/09/14/ago-makes-u-turn-anti-lgbt-recruitment-policy.html">announced</a> [Jakarta Post report] Thursday that it would rescind a policy that banned lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals from becoming employees. </p>

<p>The controversial policy had been denounced by human rights groups, who have expressed concern that the LGBT community has faced continued persecution at the hands of the government over the past year. Muhammad Nurkhoiron, commissioner of the Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/14/indonesias-attorney-general-rejects-lgbt-discrimination">spoke</a> [HRW report] critically of the policy, including the portion that likened being LGBT to having a mental illness. </p>

<p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo spoke last October on the issues that face the country in regards to attacks and discrimination against the LGBT community. Widodo <a href="http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia/2016/10/161019_indonesia_wwc_jokowi_lgbt">instructed</a> [BBC report] the police to protect members of the LGBT community from persecution, urging that "there should be no discrimination against anyone."</p>

<p>In July President Widodo signed a decree that <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/indonesia-enacts-ban-on-radical-groups.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a ban on radical groups throughout the country. Activists have warned that this step could lead to continued human rights abuses by the government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Senator <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/">Elizabeth Warren</a> [official website] on Friday introduced a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2017_09_15_Freedom_from_Equifax_Exploitation_Act_Text.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1838">announced an investigation</a> [press release] into the recent Equifax breach.  </p>

<p>The proposed legislation is said to give consumers the ability to <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/14307232/1/senator-elizabeth-warren-launches-probe-into-equifax.html">freeze their credit</a> [The Street report] for free when such attacks take place. This is a response to the massive breach of Equifax, which left the data of 143 million people unprotected. </p>

<p>Warren also wrote letters Equifax and other credit monitoring agencies to gain information in attempt to see if the consumers need new layers of protection. In a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2017_09_15_equifax.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Equifax chairman Richard Smith, Warren expressed <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1BQ16B-OCATC">concern</a> [Reuters report], "I am troubled by this attack - described as 'one of the largest risks to personally sensitive information in recent years' and by the fact that it represents the third recent instance of a data breach of Equifax or its subsidiaries that has endangered American's personal information". </p>

<p>The introduction of this legislation comes at a time where the American consumer is at constant risk to cyber attacks. A report in January indicated that in 2016 the number of data breaches <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/report-record-number-of-data-breaches-in-2016.php">reached a record</a> [JURIST report] high throughout the course of the year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/images/main_images/SanctuaryCitiesChicago.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that the Trump administration cannot withhold grants to so-called "sanctuary cities," issuing a nationwide injunction. </p>

<p>US Attorney General had said in March that cities failing to enforce immigration laws may be <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-threatens-to-cut-funding-sanctuary-cities-that-refuse-to-enforce-immigration-laws.php">cut off</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] grants, and the city of Chicago <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/chicago-sues-trump-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August after the DOJ placed restrictions on certain grants.</p>

<p>US District Judge Harry Leinenweber ruled Friday that Sessions lacked authority to place restrictions on the grants, violating separation of powers:<blockquote>The notice and access conditions therefore exceed statutory authority, and, consequently, the efforts to impose them violate the separation of powers doctrine and are <em>ultra vires</em>. The City has shown a likelihood of success on the merits as to these conditions.</blockquote>Leinenweber declined to block a requirement that cities certify their compliance with a federal law barring local governments from restricting the sharing of information with federal immigration authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six immigrants <a href="http://ia801509.us.archive.org/19/items/gov.uscourts.cand.317144/gov.uscourts.cand.317144.1.0.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday challenging the Trump administration's decision to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-responsibility-and-rule-law">end</a> [press release] the Obama-era <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</a> (DACA) [USCIS materials], arguing that the Trump administration did not follow proper administrative procedure. </p>

<p>The case, filed in the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], is the first brought by DACA recipients. According to the complaint:<blockquote>Notwithstanding the severe harm it will inflict, the government arbitrarily decided to break its promises to Plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers by terminating the DACA program. This cruel bait and switch, which was motivated by unconstitutional bias against Mexicans and Latinos, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, the due process rights of Plaintiffs and other DACA recipients, and federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs therefore seek equitable and injunctive relief to enjoin this unlawful and unconstitutional action, and respectfully request that the Court compel the government to honor its promises and uphold its end of the DACA bargain.</blockquote>Earlier in September a group of 15 states and the District of Columbia also <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/states-file-lawsuit-over-trump-administration-decision-to-eliminate-daca.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Trump administration's decision, vowing to protect young immigrants.</p>

<p>The Trump administration's decision to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/04/politics/daca-dreamers-immigration-program/index.html">disband</a> [CNN report] DACA will affect nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants. No new undocumented immigrants may <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/trump-administration-to-eliminate-daca-program.php">register</a> [JURIST report] under DACA, and the immigrants whose DACA documents are about to expire must renew by October 5, 2017. According to the administration's press release, current DACA recipients generally will not be impacted until after March 5, 2018, which will give "Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions." </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The move <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/iraq-votes-against-kurdish-independence-referendum.php">follows</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/">Council of Iraq's</a> [official website] vote on Tuesday that <a href="http://ar.parliament.iq/2017/09/12/24990/">denied</a> [official summary, Arabic] the referendum petition of Kurdistan to permit its independence. The council voted to keep Kurdistan in its region despite <a href="/forum/2014/08/michael-kelly-kurdistan-promise.php">ongoing tensions</a> [JURIST op-ed] in order to maintain the region's stability.</p>

<p>Despite the order, it is unclear whether the local government will pursue the referendum.</p>

And especially when it's done with a vision that there is a problem within the region itself, the Kurdish region. The parliament hasn't been held for 22 months, so there is a constitutional, legal crisis inside the KRG and this is a very, very bad move for the Kurdish population, the Iraqi Kurdish population.</blockquote>The Prime Minister also announced that the government is prepared to intervene militarily if the Kurdish region's referendum results in violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian officials in Delhi indicated Monday that they have not received any data from China for the Brahmaputra river this monsoon season, in violation of an <a href="http://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/22368">agreement</a> [text] signed between the two countries in 2013. </p>

<p>The Brahmaputra River, beginning in Tibet and having a southern flow into India and Bangladesh, is notorious for flooding the lower basin during the monsoon season. The river provides life to millions of inhabitants along its banks and has been a contentious issue among all three nations with vested interests in the river. International organizations have <a href="http://internationalwatercooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Brahmaputra-basin-report-final_design.pdf">hailed</a> [Hague Institute for Global Justice report] agreements signed by all parties in promoting a stable exchange of information and control of the river. </p>

<p>Chinese officials have public addressed India's concerns by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41303082">stating</a> [BBC report] that the dam is down, "for reconstruction after being damaged by the flood and out of such technological reasons as upgrading and renovation, the relevant hydrological stations in China do not have the conditions to collect relevant hydrological data now." This is being directly contradicted by a member of the joint rivers commission of Bangladesh, who has stated that Bangladesh has been provided the relevant data in the last months. </p>

<p>Groups have taken this withholding of data as a subtle jab in an ever present conflict between China and India. It is not more then a month since the two countries were able to ease tensions in a contested <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41070767">border dispute</a> [BBC report] at the Himalayan border. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jared Genser, lawyer for detained Baquer and Siamak Namazi, on Monday released the <a href="http://perseus-strategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Namazi-Letter-WGAD-Source-Opinion-49-2017.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on arbitrary detention</a> [official website], which concluded that Iran was illegally detaining the father and son without legitimate reason. </p>

<p>The non binding opinion was issued by the panel of five experts on international humanitarian law. The panel cited the Iranian actions as depriving the men of their liberty in direct violation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [materials] and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. The opinion demanded that Iran, "immediately and accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law."</p>

<p>Genser, who received the opinion in August, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-prisoners-namazi.html?mcubz=1">urges</a> [NYT report] that, "it is time for Iran to resolve these cases and allow the Namazis to be reunited with their family." The choice to release the opinion right before the gathering at the United Nations surely means to invite pressure for his clients release. </p>

<p>Both men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/iran-sentences-two-us-citizens-to-10-years-for-espionage.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in 2016 to 10 years in prison following convictions on charges that they spied and "cooperated" with the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent Ohio arrestee Timothy Davis filed a <a href="http://ia801507.us.archive.org/28/items/gov.uscourts.ohsd.206362/gov.uscourts.ohsd.206362.1.0.pdf">civil rights lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in federal court on Sunday alleging Columbus, Ohio, police used excessive force to detain him in a convenience store. </p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division</a> [official website], named defendants as the City of Columbus, Officer Joseph Bogard, Officer Matthew Baker, and Other Unknown Officers or those officers who participated in Davis' arrest. Columbus police officers arrested Davis on September 1 on a <a href="http://www.theroot.com/lawsuit-claims-that-columbus-pd-has-been-using-excessiv-1818522198">warrant for assault of a police officer</a> [NYT report], but the officers allegedly failed to disclose this information to Davis at the time of the arrest.</p>

<p>Davis alleges the officers were unnecessarily violent and caused him great physical and mental harm.<blockquote>[W]ithout cause or provocation [the officers] tased and seized hold of Timothy Davis and began to brutally punch, kick, beat and verbally abuse him with profanities and/or failed to intervene to prevent this abuse. As the beating of [] Davis was happening two or more of the Defendant Officers positioned their bodies to screen their fellow officers' excessive use of force against [] Davis from witnesses, attempting to give their fellow officers conspiratorial anonymity in which to continue their use of excessive force against Timothy Davis.</blockquote>The lawsuit sets forth liability for, among other counts, unconstitutional seizure, assault and battery, and civil conspiracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Moscow Meshchansky court <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/relatives-of-swedish-diplomat-gone-missing-at-lubyanka-sue-fsb-58510">rejected a lawsuit</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] Monday filed by a relative of Raoul Wallenberg, seeking to access uncensored documents concerning Wallenberg's death in Soviet captivity. </p>

<p>Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who is said to have rescued thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. Soviet forces captured Wallenberg in 1945 for espionage and placed him in KGB's Lubyanka Prison. The USSR released a document in 1954 saying Wallenberg died in the Lubyanka Prison of heart failure in 1947.</p>

<p>The actual cause of Wallenberg's death is still speculative. Wallenberg's niece, Marie Dupuy <a href="http://newsok.com/article/feed/1423236">filed the lawsuit against</a> [AP report] KGB successor, the Federal Security Service, requesting documents that would shed light on the circumstances surrounding his death. Ivan Pavlov, the lawyer representing the family, said "Russian authorities have been repeatedly declining to provide Wallenberg's relatives with documents, which <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170918/280150633.html">could clarify his fate</a> [RAPSI report]." The court rejected the lawsuit, stating that the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-sweden-wallenberg/russia-rejects-lawsuit-to-learn-fate-of-swedish-war-hero-wallenberg-agencies-idUSKCN1BT24P">documents could not be released</a> [Reuters report] because they also contained personal information about other individuals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

[W]e are gambling with the lives of the best among us, and we're now seeing the costs. This legislation is only part of the solution. ... We still have no path to actually appropriate the money that we are about to authorize.</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar State Counsellor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile] in a national address on Tuesday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-suukyi/myanmars-suu-kyi-condemns-abuses-in-rakhine-but-silent-on-army-role-idUSKCN1BU0C5">condemned</a> [Reuters report] human rights violations in the nation's state of Rakhine, without addressing accusations from the UN and rights groups concerning the country's campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslims. Suu Kyi pledged that, "[a]ction will be taken against all people, regardless of their religion, race and political position, who go against the law of the land and violate human rights." </p>

<p>Suu Kyi has been sharply criticized by rights groups and the international community for her silence with respect to the plight of the Rohingya. This marks her first address to the nation since the late August attacks by Rohingya insurgents, which provoked a massive military response, forcing more than 400,000 Rohingya civilians to flee to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi is also facing criticism for her government's refusal to allow UN investigators into the country to investigate the situation. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/09/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-burying-her-head-in-the-sand-about-rakhine-horrors/">criticized</a> [press release] Suu Kyi's speech stating that:<blockquote>she and her government are still burying their heads in the sand over the horrors unfolding in Rakhine State. At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming. ... While it was positive to hear Aung San Suu Kyi condemn human rights violations in Rakhine state, she is still silent about the role of the security forces in the [campaign of ethnic cleansing through murder and forced displacement of the Rohingya]. Aung San Suu Kyi's claims that her government "does not fear international scrutiny" ring hollow. Myanmar has repeatedly said it will not co-operate with the UN-mandated Fact Finding Mission established earlier this year. If Myanmar has nothing to hide, it should allow UN investigators into the country, including Rakhine State. The government must also urgently allow humanitarian actors full and unfettered access to all areas and people in need in the region. The military's campaign of violence and human rights violations in Rakhine State must end immediately.</blockquote>However, UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary-General António Guterres</a> [official website] took a more cautious tone, <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2017-09-19/secretary-generals-address-general-assembly">acknowledging</a> [statement] Suu Kyi's speech and Myanmar's intention to "implement the recommendations of the advisory committee for Rakhine state, that was chaired by Kofi Annan, within the shortest time possible." But Guterres also similarly emphasized the need to end military operations immediately.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/09/18/fuel-fire/security-force-response-2016-irreecha-cultural-festival">report</a> [text] on Monday detailing the violence carried out by the Ethiopian security forces during the Irreecha festival, the annual harvest celebration observed by the country's ethnic Oromo people. </p>

<p>According to the report, possibly hundreds of people died after being shot by security forces or drowning after attempting to flee from bullets and tear gas. The security forces were allegedly responding to anti-government chants. "One year on, government has failed to meaningfully investigate the security forces' response, and there is no independent and credible determination of the death toll," said HRW. The organization called on Ethiopia's allies to persuade the nation to agree to an investigation. </p>

<p>HRW said that the use of firearms in response to anti-government chants violates the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/UseOfForceAndFirearms.aspx">UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials</a> [official website], which say that law enforcement officials should only use firearms to defend themselves or others against the "imminent threat of death or serious injury." HRW is concerned that the same tactics will be used at the Irreecha festival being celebrated next month.  </p>

<p>After the October 2016 festival, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-urges-ethiopian-authorities-to-end-violence-against-peaceful-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST] report Ethiopia to end violence against peaceful protesters. Ethiopia <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/ethiopia-declares-national-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a national state of emergency the week after the protest.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Colombia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2015mc1394-117">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] two lawsuits against the <a href="https://www.opm.gov">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM) [official website] Tuesday for their alleged negligence in their conduct surrounding the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-incidents/">2015 OPM data breach</a> [OPM materials]. </p>

<p>The two lawsuits were filed by the <a href="https://www.afge.org">American Federation of Government Employees</a> and the <a href="https://www.nteu.org">National Treasury Employees Union</a> [advocacy websitew]. Each organization represented union members and additional federal workers who were among the estimated 20 million federal workers who had their personal information stolen in the 2015 breach. </p>

<p>The court noted the novelty of the situation, stating that:<blockquote>The fact that this is not just a data breach case, but that it is a data breach arising out of a particular sort of cyberattack against the United States, differentiates it from the majority of the legal precedent that arises in the context of retail establishments or other financial entities.</blockquote>The court ultimately concluded that the plaintiffs did not state sufficient factual allegations to bring these claims and dismissed the claim for lack of standing. </p>

<p>Cybersecurity continues to be a growing threat to countries and individuals around the world. In May President Donald Trump signed an <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-signs-executive-order-on-cybersecurity.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] designed to strengthen IT and cybersecurity frameworks in the country by having agency heads manage security risks and modernize the IT infrastructure.

		<title>Florida resident files class action suit against power company following Hurricane Irma-related outages</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man filed a <a href="https://media.local10.com/document_dev/2017/09/19/FPL%20Class-Action%20Lawsuit_1505822851313_10645349_ver1.0.pdf">civil lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against <a href="https://www.fpl.com/">Florida Power & Light Company</a> [official website] on Monday, claiming the utility company failed to make preparations that could have prevented some of the mass power outages resulting from <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/">Hurricane Irma</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> backgrounder] last week. </p>

<p>The lawsuit further claims that FPL had recently increased rates for the express purpose of making those preparations, but that money was allegedly used for lobbying efforts. </p>

<p>Plaintiff Octavio Fernandez, through his attorneys at the firms of <a href="https://msprecovery.com/">MSP Recovery</a> and <a href="http://dortalaw.com/">Dorta Law</a> [firm websites], claims to be among the nearly 4.4 million FPL customers who experienced power outages when Irma made landfall, beginning last Sunday. In his complaint, Fernandez requests an order certifying a proposed class designation so other FPL customers may join the suit. As of the night before the filing, more than 300,000 customer were still without power.  </p>

<p>Much of the suit's allegations stem from a $400 million rate hike, which was <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/Home/NewsLink?id=11459">approved</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/">Florida Public Service Commission</a> [government website] in November and was to be followed by another $411 million in increases over the next three years. FPL had originally requested a $1.3 billion increase. According to a <a href="http://newsroom.fpl.com/2016-03-15-FPL-files-details-of-proposed-2017-2020-base-rate-plan-with-PSC">statement released</a> [text] by FPL in anticipation of the rate hike, the additional revenue would provide, in part, for increased grid strengthening and storm preparation. "By strengthening power lines and related infrastructure," the statement read, "hardening initiatives [like those proposed in the plan] are designed to reduce outages and enable FPL to restore power for customers and help local communities recover more quickly when severe weather strikes." </p>

<p>Fernandez's complaint characterizes that statement as an unkept promise by the FPL.<blockquote>FPL's representation about the benefits of a rate increase and storm charge to strengthen its power lines and related infrastructures were false when made and continue to be false. The storm charges collected have not been used as represented by FPL. Customers like Plaintiff and the Class have not received the benefit of the bargain despite having paid storm charges. Rather than strengthening its grid, FPL has spent millions of dollars influencing the state legislative process. Notably, FPL has exerted its monopoly power over some of the state's most influential legislators through political contributions. These legislators in turn ensure that legislature written by FPL is swiftly enacted into law providing the monopolistic enterprise unprecedented protection and immunity for the large campaign contributions it spreads among those legislators.</blockquote>A representative from FPL <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/business/after-hurricane-irma-lawsuit-filed-against-fpl-over-power-outages/MBQ5ZDzRiKDalHebv2D4VJ/">called the lawsuit "frivolous"</a> [<em>Palm Beach Post</em> report] and alleged that one of the firms involved in the litigation was linked to a Coral Gables City Commissioner who had previously been on the losing side of a lawsuit with FPL involving the negligent placement of trees relative to FPL power lines. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sgsm18693.doc.htm">speech</a> [text] before the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General António Guterres</a> [official profile] warned the body of increasing political and social tension and instability around the world, urging respect for international humanitarian law. </p>

<p>Guterres identified seven "threats and tests" that every nation around the world is currently facing: the increasing risk of nuclear conflict, international terrorism, continuing violations of international humanitarian law, climate change, inequality, cybersecurity and the refugee crisis. </p>

<p>Guterres also condemned the numerous missile tests being carried out by the government of North Korea and asked the country to comply with last week's <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/un-security-council-adopts-fresh-sanctions-against-north-korea.php">unanimously approved Security Council resolution</a> [JURIST report] which imposed a series of new sanctions on North Korea. </p>

<p>In concluding his speech, Guterres stated:<blockquote>We need to reform our world, and I am committed to reforming the United Nations.  Together, we have embarked on a comprehensive reform effort:  to build a United Nations development system to support States in bettering peoples' lives; to reinforce our ability to safeguard peoples' peace, security and human rights; and to embrace management practices that advance those goals instead of hindering them.</blockquote>Guterres' speech marked the beginning of the 2017 annual general debate, which will run until September 25. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/biography">Secretary-General António Guterres</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2017-09-19/secretary-generals-remarks-high-level-panel-womens-economic">called on</a> [press release] public and private bodies worldwide to further incorporate women into their economies for the sake of a more peaceful and sustainable future. </p>

<p>Guterres highlighted the male-dominated nature of modern culture, stating that efforts must be continuously made to address gender inequality. According to Guterres, only 50 percent of women of working age are currently in the labor force, their employment relationships are often unstable, and on average they are paid 23 percent less than men for such employment. </p>

<p>Guterres stressed that the gender gap is not only a human rights issue but also an economic issue that affects society as a whole. As shown in studies, full gender equality in the labor force could potentially increase the global GDP by 26 percent by 2025. Accordingly, such efforts will be necessary for the <a href="https://www.empowerwomen.org/en/who-we-are/initiatives/sg-high-level-panel-on-womens-economic-empowerment">UN High-Level Panel for Women's Economic Empowerment</a> [official website] to reach its established Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Since its inception in 2016, the panel has made <a href="http://hlp-wee.unwomen.org/en/reports-toolkits">recommendations</a> [materials] for world leaders to embrace and act on the movement towards the economic integration of women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2017/9/59c111f44/unhcr-calls-drc-protect-refugees-tragic-killings.html">called on</a> [press release] the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to protect all refugees and asylum seekers in the wake of a deadly shooting incident last week. </p>

<p>In Kamanyola, Congolese soldiers violently responded to a protest allegedly ignited by detained Burundians fearing deportation. Live rounds were reportedly fired at the protesters, which included refugees and asylum seekers, resulting in 39 deaths and 94 injured individuals.  </p>

<p>According to the UNHCR's ground team, 2,400 Burundians seeking protection near Kamanyola currently live in fear of their safety and are in need of a new location with the UNHCR's assistance. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/the-high-commissioner.html">UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57553#.WcHYbtOGORs">stressed</a> [UN News Centre report] the importance of the government protecting its estimated 43,700 Burundian refugees. According to Grandi, efforts must be made to investigate the deadly incident and avoid any future occurrences. Congolese officials have officially stated that an inquiry into the matter has been initiated. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/09/19/14-35970.pdf">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [opinion, PDF] brought by more than 100 Seattle police officers who claimed the city's new <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/police-manual/title-8">guidelines</a> [text] on using force jeopardized their safety, ruling that the officers' claims were unsubstantiated by the Constitution.</p>

<p>In the opinion, the court stated:<blockquote>The City of Seattle has a significant interest in regulating the use of department-issued firearms by it police officers, and the UF Policy does not impose a substantial burden on the Second Amendment right to use a firearm for the core lawful purpose of self-defense. We conclude that the UF Policy is constitutional under the Second Amendment because there is a reasonable fit between the UF Policy and the City of Seattle's important government interest in ensuring the safety of both the public and its police officers.</blockquote>The Seattle Police Department adopted the policy in 2012 as part of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-approves-doj-settlement-over-seattle-police-department.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] after the DOJ found that Seattle police routinely used excessive force that could have been defused.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/09/19/16-16072.pdf">blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] a 2015 San Fransisco ordinance that mandated health warnings on advertisements for soda and other sugary drinks. </p>

<p>The beverage industry sued San Francisco in July 2015, seeking injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of the ordinance, which was set to go into effect on July 25, 2016. </p>

<p>The ordinance applied only to certain types of advertisements for sugar-sweetened beverages that contained one or more added sweeteners and more than 25 calories per 12 fluid ounces. These advertisers were required under the ordinance to include the following message:<blockquote>WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. This is a message from the City and County of San Francisco.</blockquote>This warning was to be enclosed in a black, rectangular box with bold typeface and take up 20 percent of the ad.</p>

<p>Representatives of the beverage industry challenged the law on First Amendment grounds, arguing that it unconstitutionally compelled speech. San Fransisco disagreed. The city stated that the purpose of the ordinance was to promote informed consumer choice, which could potentially reduce illnesses to which sugar-sweetened beverages contribute. The court concluded that "[b]ecause the ordinance is not purely factual and uncontroversial and is unduly burdensome, it offends the [beverage companies'] First Amendment rights by chilling protected commercial speech."</p>

<p>This judgment <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rejects-bid-to-block-san-francisco-sugary-drink-health-warnings.php">overturns</a> [JURIST report] a ruling from the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], which denied the industry's request for a pretrial injunction. The district court judge ruled that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their First Amendment claim, but he put the ordinance on hold pending the result of this appeal.</p>

<p>John Cote, a spokesman for San Francisco's city attorney office, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-soda-ruling/u-s-appeals-court-blocks-san-francisco-ordinance-on-soda-health-warnings-idUSKCN1BU24U">said</a> [Reuters report] the city is disappointed and evaluating all options.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wisconsin's <a href="https://wicourts.gov/courts/appeals/index.htm">Court of Appeals</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=196628">upheld</a> [ppinion, PDF] the state's right-to-work law, stating that the law does not violate the constitution. </p>

<p>The right-to-work law prohibits requiring non-union members to pay union dues as a condition of employment. Challengers of the law claimed that it amounts to a taking without just compensation for the unions, who still must represent the interests on non-union members.</p>

<p>The circuit court had previously granted summary judgement to the unions, stating that the unions had a "legally protectable property interest in the money and services expended to fulfill their duty of fair representation to non-members." The court also found that the law threatened the unions' economic viability and created a "free-rider" problem in which non-members were still represented by the unions.</p>

<p>The court of appeals acknowledged that in order for an unconstitutional takings to have occurred, it must be shown that "(1) a property interest exists; (2) the property interest has been taken; (3) the taking was for public use; and (4) the taking was without just compensation." The court found that the unions have a property interest in the money in their treasuries and the services it provides. However, it also found no takings of property occurred through the Right-to-Work Law because no money is being taken from the treasuries and the law does not require the unions to provide services to anyone.</p>

<p>The decision comes just over two months after a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/appeals-court-panel-upholds-wisconsin-right-to-work-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the law. The first lawsuits against the law were <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/wisconsin-unions-file-first-lawsuit-against-new-right-to-work-law-dnp.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Massachusetts <a href="http://ma-appellatecourts.org/">Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/sjc/reporter-of-decisions/new-opinions/11967.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that evidence of a field sobriety test is not conclusive evidence of driving under the influence of marijuana. </p>

<p>The court found that although there is clear scientific evidence that the field sobriety test performance can be used to measure blood alcohol content of at least 0.08 percent, no scientific evidence exists showing the correlation of performance on the sobriety tests and marijuana intoxication.</p>

<p>The case involved a challenge to the admissibility of field sobriety test results as evidence in driving under the influence of marijuana cases. The court ruled that the evidence can still be admitted, but there are restrictions to how it is to be presented. </p>

<p>Instead of "field sobriety tests," the tests will instead be referred to as "roadside assessments." There shall also be no statements regarding if driver "passed" or "failed" the assessment and no statement can be made that the results indicated impairment.</p>

<p>The results of the roadside assessments can still be used to indicate a driver's "balance, coordination, mental acuity, and other skills necessary to safely operate a motor vehicle." However, it cannot be used as a definitive test of impairment.</p>

<p>The court also ruled that because there is no scientific consensus on the physical characteristics that indicate marijuana intoxication, no lay person may "offer an opinion as to the defendant's sobriety or intoxication," although they still may still testify on the defendant's observable appearance, behavior, and demeanor."</p>

<p>In December, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/massachusetts-governor-signs-bill-delaying-marijuana-retail-six-months.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] the implementation of a voter approved marijuana legalization initiative by six months. Licensing of cannabis shops is now scheduled to begin July 1, 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN opened a <a href="http://undocs.org/A/CONF.229/2017/8">treaty</a> [text, PDF] for signature on Wednesday prohibiting a wide range of nuclear weapon-related actions. </p>

<p>The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/122-un-member-states-adopt-historic-treaty-on-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] during a UN conference in July by a vote of 122 to 1. </p>

<p>The treaty acknowledges the risks of nuclear warfare and calls for the total elimination of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices, explicitly prohibiting activities such as the development, transfer, receipt, use, threatening of use, or stockpiling of such weapons. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/biography">UN Secretary-General António Guterres</a> [official profile], 15,000 nuclear weapons remain in existence, and many nuclear-armed member nations such as the US, UK and France have refused to agree to the treaty. Nevertheless, the treaty will become effective 90 days after being ratified by at least 50 countries, and 42 have already signed the treaty during Wednesday's UN ceremony. Supporters of the treaty hope that the treaty's ratification will raise awareness regarding the risks of nuclear weapons and move the world closer to an arsenal-free future. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Numerous raids on government and corporate headquarters in the Catalonia region of Spain, which includes the city of <a href="http://lameva.barcelona.cat/ca/">Barcelona</a> [official website] and has a population around 7.5 million, have led to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41331152">widespread protesting and increasing tension</a> [BBC report] between police and civilians. The conflicts come as an <a href="https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/el-full-de-ruta-actualitzat-cap-a-la-independencia-en-12-passos/">October 1 vote for independence</a> [VilaWeb report, in Catalan] in the region, a vote the Spanish government has taken several actions to stop, looms less than two weeks away. </p>

<p>In addition to the raids on more than 40 ministries and three large private corporations, at least 14 Catalan officials have been detained, including members of prominent government bodies such as the economy ministry, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-police-raid-catalan-government-to-halt-banned-referendum-idUSKCN1BV0U0">Josep Maria Jové</a> [Reuters report], a high-ranking official with the vice presidency of Catalonia. The vice president of wealthy Catalonia region, Oriol Junqueras, <a href="https://twitter.com/junqueras/status/910597025258983424">tweeted</a> [tweet, in Spanish] a video of himself giving a speech to a group of protestors Wednesday along with the message "Only the people save the people. United for democracy." </p>

<p>The upcoming independence referendum in Catalonia has received considerably more attention from the central Spanish government than a previous vote, which occurred in 2014. This may be the result of a commitment by Catalonia leadership to declare independence from Spain within 48 hours of a yes vote. <a href="https://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/Paginas/default.aspx">Spain's Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/spain-constitutional-court-suspends-catalan-referendum.php">has ordered the Catalonia region to suspend the vote</a> [JURIST report]. Officials from Madrid, Spain's capital, claim defiance of that order has given them authority to crackdown on government and corporate officials in the region who continue to push for the vote. At a speech in La Moncloa on Wednesday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy <a href="http://www.eitb.eus/es/noticias/politica/detalle/5092572/rajoy-generalitat-cataluna-esta-tiempo-evitar-males-mayores/">called</a> [EITB report, in Spanish] the pro-secession "illegal and illegitimate" as well as a "major evil." </p>

<p>In a separate but related effort to regain control over the quickly escalating pro-secession movement in Catalan, Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis has given officials in the region repeated deadlines to discontinue the vote for independence. Dastis, who has said that Catalan sepratists are employing "Nazi" tactics, has said that the central government in Madrid will take over funding for basic services if Catalonian officials continue to proceed with the independence referendum.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A judge for the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection">Court of Protection</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/m-2017-ewcop-19-20170921.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Wednesday that there is no obligation for judicial consent to end care of patients in a permanent vegetative state. <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/senior-judiciary-list/">Justice Peter Jackson</a> [official profile] of the High Court Family Division oversaw proceedings on patient M, a woman who had been on an End of Life Care Plan since July 2016 and had been unresponsive for about eighteen months. </p>

<p>For almost three decades, the UK has enacted a policy of directing end of life decisions to the Court of Protection, regardless if doctors and the family agree. A UK court of appeals has also recently declined a bid to create a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-court-declines-to-create-legal-right-to-die.php">legal "right to die"</a> [JURIST report] for a man who is still conscious and would be seeking his own death.</p>

<p>The judge cited three points as to why the parties did not need to seek legal authorization to withdraw care in this case: (1) there is no statutory obligation; (2) there is no Art. 2 duty that mandates court oversight; (3) there is substantial medical consensus on withdrawal of care.</p>

<p>According to Sarah Wootton of <a href="https://compassionindying.org.uk/">Compassion in Dying</a> [advocacywebsite], this is the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41341482">right judgment</a> [BBC report]. "When all parties&#8212;family, the hospital and treating doctors&#8212;are agreed on what someone would have wanted for their care, it seems absurd to require a costly court process to confirm this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="https://www.aclumaine.org/">ACLU of Maine</a> and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy websites] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/jenkins-v-almy-complaint">challenged</a> [complaint] a Maine law requiring abortions to be performed by a physician.   </p>

<p><a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/22/title22sec1598.html">22 MRS §1598</a> [statute] reads "Any person not so licensed who knowingly performs an abortion on another person or any person who knowingly assists a nonlicensed person to perform an abortion on another person is guilty of a Class C crime."  </p>

<p>The complaint says that the statute "imposes severe burdens on women seeking abortions" which the Supreme Court has declared is unconstitutional. The complaint further states that advanced practice registered nurses, who are nurses who hold advanced degrees, are fully qualified to perform abortions. The complaint says that abortion is the only health care service that such nurses are prohibited from performing under Maine law, even though it is a comparatively safe procedure. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction and declaratory relief.  </p>

<p>At the beginning of the month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/federal-judge-blocks-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a Texas law that banned a common second trimester abortion procedure.  Last month Texas lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-restricting-insurance-coverage-for-abortions.php">approved</a> a bill restricting insurance coverage for abortions.  Also in August an Oregon governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/oregon-governor-signs-bill-expanding-coverage-of-abortions-and-birth-control.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill expanding coverage of abortions and birth control. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ACLU sues Michigan over same-sex adoption</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/DumontvLyon_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday to challenge Michigan's practice of permitting state-contracted and tax-funded child placement agencies to use religious criteria reject qualified prospective parents based on sexual orientation. </p>

<p>The complaint, filed against <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/">Michigan Department of Health and Human Services</a> (DHHS) Director <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-73970_73993-352377--,00.html">Nick Lyon</a> and Michigan Children's Services Agency Executive Director <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-73970_73993-353460--,00.html">Herman McCall</a> [official websites], <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/article/aclu-challenges-discriminatory-practices-michigan-foster-care-system">asserts</a> [ACLU report] that the process violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">Establishment</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection</a> Clauses of the United States Constitution [LII materials]. </p>

<p>The suit indirectly challenges a 2015 bill <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/michigan-governor-signs-bill-allowing-adoption-agencies-to-reject-same-sex-couples.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Governor Rick Snyder. The law permits private adoption agencies to deny placements they object to for religious reasons. Leslie Cooper, senior staff attorney at the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project, contends that when such agencies are contracted "to find foster and adoptive families for children in its custody, those agencies cannot turn away families based on religious criteria, just as the state would not be permitted to do" and that "Government services must not be provided based on religious standards and taxpayer money must not be used to fund agencies that discriminate based on religion or sexual orientation." The ACLU also argues that the practice is in conflict with Publication 225, DHHS's Adoption Program Statement, which states that the department "will not discriminate against any individual or group because of race, religion, age, national origin, color, height, weight, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political beliefs or disability."</p>

<p>The plaintiffs <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/FAQ_DumontvLyon.pdf">include</a> [ACLU fact sheet] two same-sex couples, Kristy and Dana Dumont of Dimondale and Erin and Rebecca Busk-Sutton of Detroit, who have been denied the ability to adopt because their sexual orientation, and Jennifer Ludolph, a Detroit resident who spent several years in the Michigan foster care system and objects to the use of tax payer funds to preclude prospective adoptive parents based on religious objections. "So many children in Michigan need homes," said Dumont. "The state should do all that it can to make sure children in the foster care system have access to all available, qualified families." Currently, there are about 13,000 children in Michigan's child welfare system. </p>

<p>At the present time, five states, <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/alabama-governor-signs-law-permitting-adoption-agencies-to-exclude-same-sex-couples.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-controversial-adoption-bill-into-law.php">Texas</a>, Virginia, and North and South Dakota [JURIST reports], have enacted laws that allow state-contracted adoption agencies to refuse families based on religious objection. Mississippi has a similar law that applies only to LGBTQ families that was <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/mississippi-activists-sue-state-for-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The three plaintiffs who originally <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/kentuckys-criminal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-challenged-with-lawsuit.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in June of this year argued that the ban on medical marijuana was an unconstitutional violation of Section II of the <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/lrcpubs/ib59.pdf">Kentucky Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which states that, "absolute and arbitrary power over the lives, liberty, and property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority." The plaintiff's reasoned that denying the plaintiffs the "liberty to possess and use marijuana as their property even where a medical professional ... recommends or prescribes its use" was an exercise of such "absolute and arbitrary power." </p>

<p>In reaching its conclusion, the court cited a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1357977457404923970&q=COMMONWEALTH+of+Kentucky,+Appellant,+v.+Woody+HARRELSON,+Appellee.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">2000 opinion</a> [text] of the <a href="https://courts.ky.gov/courts/supreme/Pages/supremecourt.aspx">Kentucky Supreme Court</a> [official website] wherein the Supreme Court held that the authority to regulate marijuana lay solely with the legislature. The court stated that bound by this precedent, it could not interfere. The court also added that the plaintiffs did not have a constitutional right to disobey a criminal statute outlawing the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>Currently, eight states have <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html">legalized marijuana for recreational purposes</a> [Governing materials] and another 19 states have legalized it for medical purposes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/">District of Columbia Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/15-CF-322.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that the use of cell-site simulators to detect cell phone location without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment. </p>

<p>Appellee Prince Jones filed the lawsuit after police used "<a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them">Stingray</a>" [ACLU description] devices to obtain evidence of his committed armed kidnapping, sexual abuse, robbery and use of threats. </p>

<p>In considering whether the evidence should be precluded, the court found that the use of such device is a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because, "[a] person's awareness that the government can locate and track him or her using his or her cellphone likewise should not be sufficient to negate the person's otherwise legitimate expectation of privacy." Thus, use of the device without a warrant probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches.</p>

<p>The court struck down the government's argument that the exclusionary rule does not apply, thus the government should not be precluded from presenting the evidence unconstitutionally obtained.<blockquote>[W]e reverse the trial court&#8216;s inevitable-discovery ruling and reject the government's argument that the good-faith doctrine precludes applying the exclusionary rule in this case. Because the admission at trial of the evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful search was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we reverse Mr. Jones's convictions.</blockquote>The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.oregon.gov/supreme/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/S064205.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the city's <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/424623">$35 annual tax</a> [text] imposed on residents to fund art and music programs in public schools. </p>

<p>The tax was voted on and passed in 2013 "'to restore arts and music education' in public schools 'by providing stable, long-term funding for certified arts and music teachers.'" The $35 is owed once annually by all residents meeting certain age and income requirements. </p>

<p>George Wittemyer filed the lawsuit in 2013 against the city arguing the tax violated the Ninth Amendment of Oregon's constitution, which prohibits poll or head taxes. He asserts the tax does not take income into account because the tax is the same amount for all qualified individuals, and therefore it does not consider individual income.</p>

<p>The Oregon Supreme Court rejected his argument, stating:<blockquote>A tax that takes into account the income, property, or other resources of taxpayers is not a "poll or head tax" within the meaning of Article IX, section 1a. In this case, the City of Portland arts tax exempts certain residents based on their income and household resources. Thus, the tax does take income into account and, as a result, does not amount to a "poll or head tax" within the meaning of the state constitution.</blockquote>The court's dismissal means that qualified Portland residents will continue paying $35 each April to support public school art and music programs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco <a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sfsuit.pdf">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] a nuisance lawsuit against five fossil fuel companies due to expected expenses the city will incur from global warming.  </p>

<p>The companies that were named in the law suit include BP P.L.C., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The defendants were chosen because they are "the largest investor-owned fossil fuel corporations in the world as measured by their historic production of fossil fuels."</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that the companies knew of the effects of fossil fuels on global warming since the late 1970's or early 1980's, and the "engaged in large-scale, sophisticated advertising and public relations campaigns to promote pervasive fossil fuel usage."</p>

<p>The lawsuit seeks to order the defendants to fund an abatement program for the building of seawalls to protect San Francisco from rising sea levels. The lawsuit notes that it is not intending to stop the defendants from engaging in their business.</p>

<p>The defendants are accused of initially starting campaigns to say global warming was not occurring and later downplaying the risks and harms of global warming. This was largely done through the funding of groups and researchers to publish reports and make statements questioning global warming.</p>

<p>San Francisco claims that the city will experience temperature increases of 8.6°F, increase current "100-year flood" events to occur 92 times per year, and increase sea levels by 66 inches by 2100. Upgrades to the sea wall are estimated to cost $500 million short-term, and $5 billion long term. It is also estimated that the city will have to spend $350 million to upgrade their sewer and storm water infrastructure.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the US Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/senate-committee-approves-10-million-to-un-climate-agency.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] appropriations that included $10 million to the UN agency that oversees the Paris Climate Agreement, which is meant to combat climate change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>London revokes Uber&#039;s license to operate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/13-17-licensing-decision-on-uber-london-limited.pdf">Transport for London</a> (TfL) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/13-17-licensing-decision-on-uber-london-limited.pdf">announced</a> [motice, PDF] that it will not issue a private hire operator license to Uber London Limited to operate in London. </p>

<p>Uber's current license is set to expire September 30. However, Uber is able to appeal within 21 days, and Uber will be allowed to continue its operations in London while the appeal process progresses. </p>

<p>TfL has declared that Uber has demonstrated "a lack of corporate responsibility." TfL specified that the lack of responsibility is found in each of the following areas:<blockquote>Its approach to reporting serious criminal offences.<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Its approach to how medical certificates are obtained.</li><br />
	<li>Its approach to how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are obtained.</li><br />
	<li>Its approach to explaining the use of Greyball in London, software that could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app and prevent officials from undertaking regulatory or law enforcement duties</li><br />
</ul></blockquote>London's Mayor, <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/mayor-london">Sadiq Khan</a> [Official Website], has <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/city-hall-blog/mayor-london-response-tfls-licensing-decision-uber">announced</a> [Press release] his support of the TfL decision. He has stated that "it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety and security." He also stated that Uber needs to "play by the rules."</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/save-your-uber-in-london-saveyouruber?recruiter=792416512&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=share_email_responsive">petition</a> [Change.org petition] to ask the governor to reverse the decision has already received over 300,000 signatures 6 hours after starting.</p>

<p>Uber has seen increased regulations in Europe over the past year. In May the European Court of Justice (ECJ) had <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">given a non-binding opinion</a> [JURIST report] that Uber was a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. In December, Denmark had <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] Uber's European branch over charges of assisting drivers in violating taxi laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="/documents/presidentialmemos/2017/09/2017-20381.php">Proclamation</a> [text] issued late Sunday, US President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile] identified eight countries that have failed to cooperate in information sharing activities to the extent the administration deems necessary to protect US security interests. The affected countries are:<br />
<ol><li>Chad</li><li>Iran</li><li>Libya</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Syria</li><li>Venezuela</li><li>Yemen</li><li>Somalia</li></ol>Subject to limitations and exceptions also identified in the proclamation, nationals of the eight identified countries are prohibited from entering the US. </p>

<p>It may take a minute to parse the entire order, but a few things are worth noting at the outset:</p>

<ol>
<li>This was issued as a presidential proclamation and not an executive order. There will doubtless be discussion of whether there is a difference and, if so, what that difference is.</li>
<li>The eight countries at issue here are not the same as the seven Muslim-majority countries identified in the president's earlier executive order limiting immigration. Notably, six of the eight countries identified here are Muslim-majority.</li>
<li>The proclamation provides, at Section 3, for exceptions for, <em>inter alia</em> dual nationals, those traveling on diplomatic missions, and permanent  US residents, thus providing a level of clarity that was missing from the earlier executive action.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.judiciary.hk/en/index/">Hong Kong High Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="http://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=111447&currpage=T">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Monday that a British lesbian should be granted a spousal visa to join her partner who works in the city.</p>

<p>The court effectively overturned the decision of the <a href="http://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/">Hong Kong Immigration Department</a> [official website], finding no justification on "indirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation" and ordering the Department to submit an agreement between it and the woman within 28 days.</p>

<p>According to the Department, the woman was refused a visa because she was not a "spouse," which applies only to husband and wife in a heterosexual and monogamous marriage, the only marriage recognized under<a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/images/basiclaw_full_text_en.pdf"> Article 37 of the Basic Law</a> [text, PDF]. Furthermore, according to the Director, the Department's policy is "to strike a balance between maintaining Hong Kong's continued ability to attract people of the right talent and skills...to work, and the need for a system of effective,strict and stringent immigration control." However, the woman, known as QT, entered into a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership ACT 2004 in England.</p>

<p>According to Chief Judge Andrew Cheung,<blockquote>There is no inherent or otherwise necessary or obvious link between immigration and the status of marriage that requires exempting the differential treatment under a particular immigration policy of married same‑sex couples or couples under a civil partnership from the requirement of justification. Excluding the foreign worker&#8217;s lawfully married (albeit same‑sex) spouse or civil partner under a civil partnership lawfully entered into in a foreign country from coming to Hong Kong to join the worker is, quite obviously, counter‑productive to attracting the worker to come to or remain in Hong Kong to work in the first place.. and excluding such a spouse or civil partner from entering or remaining in Hong Kong does not advance or help maintain our strict, stringent immigration policy either.</blockquote>In May, Taiwan became the <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/taiwan-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage.php">first Asian country to legalize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriages. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but <a href="www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1898421/gay-man-sues-right-marry-chinas-first-same-sex-marriage">same-sex marriage is not legal</a> [SCMP report], and same-sex couples have no legal protections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.itlos.org/en/top/home">International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.23_merits/C23_Judgment_23.09.2017_orig.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Saturday in favor of Ghana in a lengthy maritime dispute between with the Ivory Coast. </p>

<p>The case, which was brought to the international body by Ghana in 2014, was an attempt to clarify the boundary between the two countries, as both countries were vying for oil in the area. The court <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_264_EN.pdf">unanimously ruled</a> [press release] in favor of Ghana, dismissing the claim that Ghana violated the territorial rights of Ivory Coast when it expanded its oil exploration in the area. </p>

<p>The ruling definitively creates a boundary, in the form of a straight line running from the land boarder of the two nations. The ruling came in accordance with the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> [materials].</p>

<p>The Ivory Coast has publicly accepted the tribunal's ruling, with government spokesperson Bruno Kone <a href="http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/25/ivory-coast-accepts-tribunal-ruling-in-border-dispute-with-ghana/">stating</a> [Africa News report] "What's important is to preserve our good neighborly relations with Ghana" adding, "this judgement allows for a definitive demarcation of the maritime boundary."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Switzerland voters reject pension reform in national referendum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switzerland took part in a national referendum on Sunday in which 53 percent of voters rejected a pension reform plan known as <a href="https://www.mercer.ch/content/dam/mercer/attachments/europe/switzerland/ch-2017-swiss-pension-reform-2020-sample-report-mercer.pdf">Pension Reform 2020</a> [background]. </p>

<p>The plan set out to secure retirement benefits for Switzerland's aging population. The proposed reform addressed pension concerns caused by baby boomers nearing retirement age and life expectancy reaching an all-time high of 83. </p>

<p>Those who were in favor of the plan say the existing structure is unable to make annual payments from the AHV/AVS (social security retirement), as annual contributions are lower than payout demands. Among other changes, the reform would have increased employer and employee AHV/AVS contribution rates by .15 percent of pay, increased the retirement age for women from 64 to 65, and increased the value-added tax (VAT) from eight to 8.3 percent.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gfsbern.ch/en-us/Home">GfS Bern institute</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/swiss-voters-nix-pension-reform-in-national-referendum/a-40660501">speculates</a> (DW Report) that some voters supported the referendum, but opposed the increase of VAT. </p>

<p>Pension Reform 2020 was approved by <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/en">Parliament</a> [official website] in March, but because reform included an increase in the VAT, it needed "double approval" to pass. This includes majority support among voters and majority support in more than half of the country's 26 cantons. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Monday removed the travel ban cases from its calendar and ordered both sides to file new briefs in light of President Donald Trump's <a href="/documents/presidentialmemos/2017/09/2017-20381.php">proclamation</a> [text] Sunday that created new restrictions to enter the US for citizens from <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/trump-significantly-limits-entry-into-us-from-eight-nations.php">eight countries</a> [JURIST report]. </p>

<p>In a brief order, the court directed the parties:<blockquote>to file letter briefs addressing whether, or to what extent, the Proclamation issued on September 24, 2017, may render cases No. 16-1436 and 16-1540 moot. The parties should also address whether, or to what extent, the scheduled expiration of Sections 6(a) and 6(b) of Executive Order No. 13780 may render those aspects of case No. 16-1540 moot. The briefs, limited to 10 pages, are to be filed simultaneously with the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel on or before noon, Thursday, October 5, 2017. The cases are removed from the oral argument calendar, pending further order of the Court.</blockquote>Trump's proclamation, which will replace the expiring <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">travel ban</a> [text], affects citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.</p>

<p>The proclamation creates a ban on immigrant visas for nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and non-immigrant visas are also suspended to nationals of Chad, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Yemen. A suspension of non-immigrant visas to citizens for Venezuela will apply only to certain government officials and their immediate families. The restrictions target countries that the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] determined do not share sufficient information or have not taken security precautions deemed necessary to protect US security interests. The US had shared these baseline security requirements and gave the world 50 days to comply.</p>

<p>Narrow, case-by-case waivers exist for citizens of the affected countries if an individual meets certain criteria, such as: the individual "has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity," "has previously established significant contacts with the United States," "seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen," or "has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government."</p>

<p>Following the announcement of the proclamation, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912101775221706752">tweeted</a> [text], "Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet."</p>

<p>The new rules are set to go into effect October 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] released <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/">estimated crime statistics</a> [FBI annual report] for 2016 on Monday, which <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2016-crime-statistics">revealed</a> [press release] a 4.1 percent increase in violent crimes committed when compared to 2015. </p>

<p>The report "is a statistical compilation of offense, arrest, and police employee data reported by law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the FBI's <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/">Uniform Crime Reporting</a> (UCR) [official website] Program." The publication includes statistics for severe crimes including murder, rape, arson and robbery, among others. </p>

<p>Each crime report is broken down by location, agency, or the like, and contains several statistics reports. One data table for human sex trafficking statistics reveals Texas far surpassed any other state with <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/additional-publications/human-trafficking/table-3">485 perpetrator arrests</a> [data table]. Nationally, violent crime was estimated at "386.3 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants," with 1,248,185 total, and property crime at "2,450.7 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants," with 7,919,035 total. </p>

<p>The UCR Program was created over 30 years ago, yet not all states, cities, and counties participate. The FBI hopes the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/new-ucr-project">New UCR Program</a> [materials] launched in February will increase agency participation in all 50 states for more accurate reporting. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Crimea2014_2017_EN.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] on Monday that human rights violations have significantly increased in Crimea since Russia began occupation over the territory in March 2014, with many violations committed by Russian state agents. </p>

<p>The most significant change Russia made in Crimea is the implementation of Russian citizenship. Many oppose Russian citizenship and refuse to show allegiance to Russia. Individuals without Russian Federation citizenship are denied many rights, including, among others, the right to vote or run for office, the right to own agricultural land, and the right to register a religious community. The groups most susceptible to human rights violations are "those who formally rejected citizenship; civil servants who had to renounce their Ukrainian citizenship or lose their jobs; and Crimean residents who did not meet the legal criteria for citizenship and became foreigners." </p>

<p>Human rights violations are seen at the judicial and law enforcement levels, with courts, the Crimean Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), and local police reported as perpetrators:<blockquote>Russian Federation justice system applied in Crimea often failed to uphold fair trial rights and due process guarantees. Court decisions have confirmed actions, decisions and requests of investigating or prosecuting bodies, seemingly without proper judicial oversight. ...  Grave human rights violations, such as arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture, and at least one extra-judicial execution were documented. ... [A]uthorities in Crimea have failed to effectively investigate most allegations of human rights violations committed by the security forces or armed groups acting under the direction or control of the state.</blockquote>The report lists 20 recommendations for Russia in Crimea to reduce and remedy human rights violations, including re-implementation of Ukrainian law and ensuring independent and impartial administration of justice. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ukraine enacts controversial Ukrainian language education law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en">President Petro Poroshenko</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/news/prezident-pidpisav-zakon-ukrayini-pro-osvitu-43606">signed</a> [press release] a controversial education bill into law on Monday that makes Ukrainian the required language in state schols, among other things.</p>

<p>Specifically, the law declares that Ukrainian will be the medium of instruction in all schools, eliminating options for minority languages such as Russian and Hungarian. </p>

<p>Russia, Hungary and Romania, among others, had already expressed concern for the bill when it was first drafted, fearing marginalization of minority rights. With the bill now becoming law, Hungarian Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/the-minister">Peter Szijjarto</a> [official profile] made a <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/this-will-be-painful-for-ukraine">statement</a> [text] calling the law "a shame and a disgrace," and adding that "We guarantee that all this will be painful for Ukraine in the future."  </p>

<p>Hungary's <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-human-resources">Ministry of Human Capacities</a> [official website] also urged Ukraine to consult with its Hungarian minority groups who are not involved in the drafting of the bill and the subsequent legislative process, <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-human-resources/news/new-ukrainian-education-act-is-a-dead-end-government-of-hungary-rejects-the-regulation-discriminating-against-national-minorities">warning</a> [statement] that "Ukraine's leadership is steering its own country not toward Europe, but toward a dead end."</p>

<p>Ukrainian government officials have rejected any suggestion that minority languages will be sidelined. These officials state the law merely "strengthens the role of the Ukrainian language in education," in addition to protecting the education rights of all minorities. </p>

<p>Russia has condemned the law saying that it violates Ukraine's international obligations while Romania's president had already canceled a visit to Ukraine last week protesting the bill before it was enacted. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57728#.Wcpyu9gpDIU">warned</a> [UN News Centre report] on Monday that continued illegal settlements in East Jerusalem are threatening the hopes for a two-state solution in the area and undermining Palestinian belief in peace prospects. </p>

<p>Mladenov's <a href="https://unsco.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/report_unscr_2334.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] highlights Israel's plans for developing more than 2,300 housing units in July, including about 1,600 units expanding settlement into the northern region of East Jerusalem and the Palestinian neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. According to Mladenov, eviction proceedings are underway for 180 Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, 60 of whom, including a 50-year resident family, are from Sheikh Jarrah.</p>

<p>Mladenov's report concluded:<blockquote>Israel did not "cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard," as called for by the resolution. Since June 20, Israel's illegal settlement activities have continued at a high rate, a consistent pattern over the course of the year. ... In addition to illegal settlements, the practice of demolishing Palestinian structures in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and displacing Palestinians undermines the prospects for peace. Continued violence against civilians and incitement perpetuate mutual fear and suspicion, while impeding any efforts to bridge the gaps between the two sides. ... While all initiatives to improve the Palestinian economy are welcome, more needs to be done, as part of a political process aimed at establishing a Palestinian State. Economic development, critical as it is, is no substitute for sovereignty and statehood.</blockquote>Mladenov closed with an appeal to the international community to help "establish a peaceful, prosperous and secure future&#8212;for Palestinians, for Israelis and for the entire region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://deepgreenresistance.org/en/who-we-are/about-deep-green-resistance">Deep Green Resistance</a> [advocacy website], a direct action environmental group, filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking the <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [judicial website] to grant personhood status to the Colorado River. If personhood status is granted, the State of Colorado could be held liable for violating the river's rights.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://dgrnewsservice.org/colorado-river-v-colorado/">complaint</a> [text] reads in part:<blockquote>Through this action, the Plaintiffs are asking this Court to recognize and declare that the Colorado River is capable of possessing rights similar to a "person," and that as part of that declaration, that the Colorado River has certain rights to exist, flourish, regenerate, and naturally evolve. In the absence of such a finding, Plaintiffs contend that existing environmental laws will continue to fail to protect the Colorado River, and thus, continue to fail to protect the human and natural communities that are dependent on the River.</blockquote>The <a href="https://celdf.org/">Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund</a> [advocacy website] announced in a <a href="https://celdf.org/2017/09/press-release-colorado-river-v-state-colorado-first-nation-federal-lawsuit-river-seeks-recognition-legal-rights-exist-restoration/">press release</a> [text] on Thursday that they will be serving as a legal adviser to the Deep Green Resistance, calling the complaint a "first-in-the-nation."  </p>

<p>In the past, the environmental groups have been named as the plaintiffs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30945925">King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud </a> [BBC profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&newsid=1671331#1671331">announced</a> [press release] by decree that the country will grant women driver's licenses beginning next June. </p>

<p>The order was broadcast though Saudi Arabia's <a href="http://www.spa.gov.sa/?lang=en">state television channel</a> [official site] and would allow women the legal right to drive.  The country is the only nation to outright forbid women from driving in any capacity due to the <a href="/dateline/2017/06/Ohud-Alzahran-wali-system-abolition.php">guardianship laws</a> JURIST op-ed] in connection with cultural and religious beliefs associated with Sharia Law. </p>

<p>The decree reads as follows:<blockquote>We adopt the application of the provisions of the Traffic Law and its Executive Regulations&#8212;including the issuance of driving licenses&#8212;to both males and females, and to form a high-level committee of ministries of (internal affairs, finance, labor and social development) to study the necessary arrangements for enforcement; the implementation shall be&#8212;God willing&#8212;as of 10/10/1439 AH, in accordance with the approved Sharia and regulations and completion of what is required by it.</blockquote><a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/04/23/Who-is-Prince-Khaled-bin-Salman-Saudi-Arabia-s-new-ambassador-to-the-US-.html">Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz</a> [Alarabiya profile], the Saudi Ambassador to the US, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-women-driving-envoy/saudi-ambassador-to-u-s-says-his-society-is-ready-to-let-women-drive-idUSKCN1C12ZB?il=0">supported</a> [RT report] the decree by saying it had become socially acceptable for women to drive as women are a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/10/news/economy/saudi-arabia-women-freedom-economy-review/index.html">growing economic force</a> [CNN report]. However, women may still need permission from their male family members to drive as the decree gives the committee the right to create guidelines within Sharia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-gives-address-importance-free-speech-college-campuses">speech</a> [text, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTZInol4tA">video</a>] at the <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/press-releases/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-at-georgetown-law.cfm">Georgetown University Law Center</a> [press release] on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Department of Justice will become more involved in the "national recommitment to free speech on campus[es]." Citing recent incidents at community colleges in <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/YAL-KelloggMPI.pdf">Battle Creek, Michigan</a> and <a href="https://d28htnjz2elwuj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/28075432/Complaint-Shaw-v.Burke_.pdf">Los Angeles, California</a> [complaints, PDF], where students were arrested for or prohibited from handing out copies of the Constitution outside of designated "free speech zones," Sessions said the DOJ will "enforce federal law, defend free speech, and protect students' free expression from whatever end of the political spectrum it may come." </p>

<p>Notably, Sessions gave the speech on the same day the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-files-statement-interest-defense-campus-free-speech">filed</a> [press release] a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4060871-Uzuegbunam-v-Preczweski-United-States-Statement.html">Statement of Interest</a> [text] in a lawsuit related to "free speech zones" at Georgia Gwinnett College in Georgia. Sessions mentioned the filing in his speech, adding that similar filings could be expected in "the weeks and months to come." </p>

<p>Sessions decried the actions of protesters, whom he referenced as part of an increasing "cottage industry" against free speech. He pointed to a recent <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2017/03/03/protesters-created-violent-incident-middlebury/98711176/">incident at Middlebury College</a> [<em>Burlington Free Press</em> report] in Vermont, where students protesting a debate between a professor and Libertarian political scientist <a href="http://www.aei.org/scholar/charles-murray/">Charles Murray</a> [official profile] were successful in shutting the event down with protests that later turned violent. Sessions said colleges that acquiesce to protesters, including canceled events at Berkeley, Brown and Virginia Tech, were permitting "the heckler's veto" to control decisions on the exchange of ideas.<blockquote>Freedom of thought and speech on the American campus are under attack. The American university was once the center of academic freedom&#8212;a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas. But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.</blockquote>Following the speech, Sessions answered questions that had been submitted by students on topics ranging from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/the-silencing-of-elizabeth-warren-and-an-old-senate-rule-prompted-by-a-fistfight/?utm_term=.d4c5a3484848">the use of Senate Rule 19 to silence Elizabeth Warren</a> [WP report] during Sessions' confirmation hearing and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/sports/nfl-trump-anthem-protests.html">President Trump's reaction to NFL player protests</a> [NYT report] during the National Anthem. </p>

<p>Around 100 students and faculty members <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/09/26/georgetown-law-students-plan-to-protest-jeff-sessionss-speech/?utm_term=.cc6f0aafd3da">protested</a> [WP report] the speech, holding signs and shouting questions they would have asked through a bullhorn. Sessions briefly addressed the protesters from the stage, promising to fight for their right to express their opinions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dean Skelos, who was once considered one of the most power legislators in his state, was accused of soliciting payments to his son from numerous New York corporations in return for political favors over a five-year period. </p>

<p>In reaching its decision, the court relied upon the decision of the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-474_ljgm.pdf">McDonnell v. United States</a> [opinion], in which the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/virginia-governors-conviction-vacated-by-supreme-court.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that acts such as communicating with fellow politicians and setting up meetings with other parties, political or not, did not qualify as "official acts" for the purposes of federal corruption and bribery laws. In light of this precedent, the court concluded that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that "acts customarily performed by a public official with a particular position" fall under the relevant laws. </p>

<p>The matter will now be remanded and a subsequent retrial of both Skelos and his son is expected. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China's <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/english/">Cyberspace Administration of China</a> (CAC) [official website] has <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2017-08/11/c_1121467425.htm">imposed fines</a> [CAC statement, in Chinese] on some of the country's top technology firms for failing to censor online content in accordance with China's censorship laws. </p>

<p>Among the companies are <a href="http://www.tencent.com/en-us/index.html">Tencent Holdings</a>, <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a> and <a href="http://ir.weibo.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253076&p=irol-irhome">Weibo Corporation</a> [corporate websites]. According to two statements from the Chinese government, one from regulators in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eNkQl9JCf3kz96gAhozuEw">Beijing</a> and the other from those in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yW7FSz_4OsJviJqT-AyzHg">Guangdong</a> [statements, in Chinese], all three companies failed to censor their respective social media platforms for "information of violence and terror, false rumors, pornography, and other information that jeopardizes national security, public safety, and social order."</p>

<p>The regulators claim that by doing so, these companies violated <a href="http://www.chinalawtranslate.com/cybersecuritylaw/?lang=en">Article 47 of the 2016 Chinese Cybersecurity Law</a> [materials], which states: <blockquote>Network operators shall strengthen management of information published by users, and upon discovering information that the law or administrative regulations prohibits the publication or transmission of, they shall immediately stop transmission of that information, employ handling measures such as deleting it, to prevent the information from spreading, save relevant records, and report it to the relevant competent departments.</blockquote>The notices provided by the CAC and the regulators do not mention exactly how much these fines will be but state that each company will receive the "maximum penalty." The notices also requires that all impacted companies take swift action to remove the content and the accounts that shared it.</p>

<p>This crackdown on online content comes three weeks before China's 19th Party Congress, a meeting of the whole Chinese Congress which takes place once every five years. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Register <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/18/2017-19365/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records">posted a notice</a> [text] on Monday detailing an updated rule that will allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to track social media accounts of immigrants. </p>

<p>The social media accounts will be collected as part of the standard immigration review process to decide if an individual is permitted to remain within or gain entry into the US.<br />
 <br />
The notice expands the current collection process to the following:<blockquote>country of nationality; country of residence; the USCIS Online Account Number; social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results; and the Department of Justice (DOJ), Executive Office for Immigration Review and Board of Immigration Appeals proceedings information.</blockquote>The new rule will allow various federally enforced agencies under DHS to rely on already established relationships with commercial data providers to gather the information of any individual that passes through the immigration system to assist any immigrant and non-immigrant investigations. The purpose of the new rule is to streamline the data collection and storage of personally identifiable information to aid DHS officials. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ireland's government on Tuesday announced plans to <a href="https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/News/Government_Sets_Indicative_Timetable_For_Referendums.html">hold a referendum</a> [press release] next year regarding its strict abortion laws.</p>

<p>Citizens are urging the government to amend the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1983/ca/8/enacted/en/print">Eighth Amendment</a> [materials] of the Constitution, which dictates that an unborn child and mother have an equal right to life. Citizens' Assembly, a panel composed of citizens, prepared a report that will be considered by the Joint Oirachtas Committee, which may propose a bill to amend.</p>

<p>According to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar<blockquote>Any amendment to our Constitution requires careful consideration by the people. They should be given ample time to consider the issues and to take part in well-informed public debate. Setting a timetable for the referendums to be held over the next two years will allow all involved in campaigning on the issues to plan ahead and to facilitate that public debate.</blockquote>The referendum will likely be held in May or June of 2018.</p>

<p>In 2013 citizen protests resulted in mothers' right <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ireland-government-introduces-abortion-legislation.php">to terminate pregnancy</a> [JURIST report] if their life was in danger. In July of last year the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/">Irish Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ireland-parliament-defeats-abortion-bill.php">defeated a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand's Supreme Court unaminously convicted former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile] in absentia on Wednesday, sentencing her to five years in prison for mismanaging a rice subsidy scheme resulting in billions lost.</p>

<p>According to the Court, "The accused knew that the government-to-government rice contract was unlawful but did not prevent it. Which is a manner of seeking unlawful gains. Therefore, the action of the accused is considered negligence of duty."</p>

<p>Yingluck <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-relating-to-rice-scheme.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to the charges in 2015 but <a href="/paperchase/2017/08/thailand-ex-pm-flees-country-ahead-of-verdict-reports.php">fled</a> [JURIST reports] the country last month. A warrant is now issued for her arrest.</p>

<p>In 2014 Yingluck was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-pm-ordered-to-step-down-for-abuse-of-power.php">overthrown by a coup</a> resulting in the <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/thailand-military-suspends-constitution-seizes-control-of-government.php">military seizing control</a> [JURIST reports] of the government. </p>

<p>Thailand's political system had been unstable since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5361512.stm">2006 military coup</a> [BBC report] from the decade-long clash between the traditional elitist and the Shinawatra family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-26/pdf/2017-20310.pdf">announced</a> [Federal Register, PDF] the creation of the Smart Sectors program to "re-examine how the EPA engages with industry in order to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, create certainty and predictability, and improve the ability of both EPA and industry to conduct long-term regulatory planning while also protecting the environment and public health."</p>

<p>The EPA identified 11 different industries that will be the initial focus of the program: aerospace; agriculture; automotive; cement and concrete; chemical manufacturing; construction; electronics and technology; iron and steel; oil and gas; ports and shipping; and utilities and power generation.</p>

<p>Each industry will be assigned liaisons who are experienced in those individual industries. These liaisons will have three main goals: "building relationships and improving customer service to sectors; developing additional expertise in each industry's operations and environmental performance; and informing the planning of future policies, regulations, and Agency processes."</p>

<p>The use of the liaisons should help ensure that environmental improvements are still experienced, but also allows the industries to better provide their input into innovative ways that the EPA's environmental goals can be met in order to reduce unnecessary burdens.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump has previously expressed the need to reduce regulations within the US. In January Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-to-cut-federal-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order requiring two regulations to be removed for every new regulation enacted. In February Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-executive-order-to-reduce-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] another executive order requiring the creation of regulatory task forces in every agency to determine which regulations can be removed or consolidated. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Finance Minister Ishaq Dar was indicted on Wednesday on graft charges after investigators found his assets did not match his reported income.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau (NAB)</a> [official website], Pakistan's highest anti-corruption organization, filed the case against Dar for possessing assets beyond his known sources of income in light of the July 28 <a href="/paperchase/Khan%20v.%20Sharif.pdf">verdict</a> [order, PDF] of the Supreme Court in the <a href="/paperchase/2017/07/pakistani-prime-minister-resigns-after-being-disqualified-from-office.php">Panama Papers</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36092356">case</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The case resulted in the Supreme Court disqualifying <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22167511">Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile] from office and the Prime minister subsequently <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-pakistan-sharif-20170728-story.html">resigning</a> [LA Times report]. Dar's indictment comes a day after Sharif made his first appearance before a judge to face corruption cases.</p>

<p>Dar has a long history with the Sharif family. He was imprisoned in 1999 when the Sharif government toppled. He is also married to Sharif's daughter.</p>

<p>After the charges against the Dar were read out by Judge Mohammad Bashir, Dar refused to accept the charges. The minister has repeatedly denied his charges, stating that his assets were in accordance with income. Despite the indictment, Dar can continue to work as a minister until he is found guilty. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission (IHERC) of Kurdistan <a href="http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/2b679b2a-29fe-4fa2-abe8-5adf3a0d4af6">announced</a> [Kurdistan report] the results of Monday's independence referendum vote Wednesday. In total, 92 percent of the voters voted "Yes" to secede from Iraq and create an independent Kurdistan. About 72 percent of eligible voters in the Kurdistan region participated in the vote. </p>

<p>Of the 3.3 million votes cast, 2,861,471 voted "Yes" and 224,468 voted "No." Another 170,611 votes were considered to be "spoiled votes," and another 9,368 were blank votes. A total of 98,945 votes came from registered voters who were located outside of the Kurdistan region.</p>

<p>Iraq and neighboring countries have opposed the referendum. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] has <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/09/274419.htm">expressed</a> [press release] disappointment that the vote was conducted. They also stated that the move will increase instability in the region, which can be exploited by the Islamic State and other extremist groups.</p>

<p>Although the referendum does not actually grant Kurdistan independence, Kurdistan's leadership stated it will help in negotiations with Baghdad regarding the independence. In total, there are an estimated 40 million Kurds throughout the world.</p>

<p>The vote came less than two weeks after the Council of Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/iraq-votes-against-kurdish-independence-referendum.php">voted against</a> [JURIST report] allowing the referendum vote. Shortly after the Council of Iraq's vote, the Iraqi Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/09/iraqi-lawmakers-vote-to-dismiss-kirkuk-governor-over-independence-referendum.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to oust the governor of Kirkuk due to the referendum vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 25 refugees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/first-manus-island-held-refugees-flown-to-us-under-resettlement-deal">left</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] a detention center on Manus Island in <a href="http://www.pm.gov.pg/">Papua New Guinea</a> [government website] on Tuesday to travel to the US for resettlement, becoming the first of several hundred such refugees who will make the journey as part of an <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/australia-us-agree-on-resettlement-of-refugees-detained-on-nauru-and-manus-island.php">agreement between former US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</a> [JURIST report]. </p>

<p>A second group is expected to leave a detention center on the island nation of <a href="http://www.naurugov.nr/">Nauru</a> [government website] later this week, with the total number of 54 refugees who have been approved for entry in the US, having successfully completed an "extreme vetting process" <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">mandated</a> [executive order] by the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The agreement by then-president Barack Obama to accept the refugees, which was followed months later by Turnbull's agreement to accept refugee's from an American detention center in Costa Rica, has resulted in tension between Turnbull and President Donald Trump. According to transcripts <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-us-australia-refugee-deal-trump-immigration-2017-8/#what-the-refugee-deal-is-1">released</a> [<em>Business Insider</em> report] last month of a phone call between the two leaders that took place in January, Trump called the agreement the "worst deal ever," and repeatedly insisted that the number of refugees involved was between 2,000 and 5,000. During the call, Turnbull refuted that contention, saying the agreement was for 1,250 individuals, who would be subject to the US vetting process before immigrating. </p>

<p>Humanitarian groups, including the <a href="https://www.hrlc.org.au/">Human Rights Law Centre</a>, have estimated the total number of refugees that remain in the two island detention centers to be around 2,000. Of those, it remains uncertain how many will be relocating to the US, and how many would resettle in other countries, including Australia. <br />
Daniel Webb, Director of Legal Advocacy at the HRLC, <a href="https://www.hrlc.org.au/news/2017/9/26/refugees-leave-manus-for-the-us-but-limbo-continues-for-the-2000-left">said</a> [press release] "today was a good day" for the refugees who were finally able to travel to the US, but that challenges still exist for those whose futures were still uncertain.<blockquote>For the first time in a long time these men can finally feel hopeful, optimistic and free. But the tragic reality is that hope for a handful doesn't end the suffering of the 2000 innocent people left behind. After four years of fear, violence and limbo, safety for a handful isn't good enough. Every single one of these innocent people has had four years of their life ripped away from them. Every single one of them deserves a future. [The Australian] government must not abandon one single life in limbo.</blockquote>Beverly Thacker, an official with the <a href="https://pg.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy in Papua New Guinea</a> [government website], declined to confirm how many refugees would be traveling to the US. "Other refugee cases are under review," Thacker said recently. "They all have different time frames and we will expect that others will be advanced in the coming months."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A widespread investigation into a corruption scheme between coaches at NCAA Division-1 basketball programs, an international apparel company, and financial advisors led to the arrest of 10 men on Tuesday, according to an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-arrest-10-individuals-including-four-division-i-coaches-college#_ftn1">announcement</a> [text] by an acting <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny">US Attorney</a> and an <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [government websites] assistant director.</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaints [<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999001/download">US v. Chuck Person and Rashan Michel</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999006/download">US v. James Gatto</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999011/download">US v. Lamont Evans</a>, PDF] the scheme involved coaches accepting cash bribes from apparel companies, including <a href="https://www.adidas-group.com/en/group/profile/">Adidas</a> [corporate website], in exchange for steering student-athlete players, high school recruits, and their family members, to corrupt financial advisors. </p>

<p>According to the announcement, those arrested on Tuesday include:<blockquote>Chuck Connors Person, assistant coach at Auburn<br />
Rashan Michel, former NCAA and NBA referee, and clothier<br />
Lamont Evans, assistant coach at Oklahoma State<br />
Emanuel "Book" Richardson, assistant coach at Arizona<br />
Anthony "Tony" Bland, assistant coach at USC<br />
Christian Dawkins, sports agent<br />
Munish Sood, financial advisor<br />
James "Jim" Gatto, head of global sports marketing at Adidas<br />
Merl Code, employee at Adidas<br />
Jonathan Brad Augustine, president of the <a href="http://www.theleagueint.com/#about-us-section">League Initiative</a> [official profile], program director of 1-Family AAU</blockquote>Although he has not been arrested or named in any of the complaints, University of Louisville head coach <a href="http://www.gocards.com/coaches.aspx?rc=522&path=mbball">Rick Pitino</a> [official profile] was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/sports/rick-pitino-fired.html">"ousted" by the program on Wednesday</a> [NYT report] in response to the team's alleged involvement with the scheme. Federal prosecutors have accused two unidentified Louisville coaches of accepting bribes from Adidas to steer high school recruits to the program. Louisville interim president Greg Postel <a href="https://www.cardchronicle.com/2017/9/26/16369216/u-of-l-interim-president-greg-postel-releases-statement-on-fbi-investigation">said</a> [press release] the University would cooperate with the ongoing FBI investigation.</p>

<p>Pitino was placed on unpaid administrative leave indefinitely, a move his attorney <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonRileyWDRB/status/913149165257052160">characterized</a> [statement, Twitter] as being "in effect ... fired." At this time, it is unclear if charges will be brought against Pitino who, through his attorney, has maintained his innocence. The program was recently sanctioned for a <a href="https://deadspin.com/louisville-sure-we-hosted-sex-parties-but-they-were-1791650356">scandal</a> [<em>Deadspin</em> report] involving the use of prostitutes at dorm parties in an effort to recruit players. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://aclu-co.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado</a> (ACLU-CO) [advocacy website] <a href="https://aclu-co.org/aclu-sues-aurora-police-ousting-black-man-hoodie-coffee-shop/">filed a lawsuit</a> [press release] Wednesday alleging unlawful racial profiling. </p>

<p>In the <a href="https://acluco-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HassanComplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], the ACLU alleges officers from the Aurora police department prevented Omar Hassan, a black Ethiopian man, from dining at a <a href="https://www.cariboucoffee.com/home">Caribou Coffee</a> [corporate website] in March 2016. The complaint alleges the officers racially profiled Hassan due to the fact he spoke with an accent and wore a hoodie. According to the suit they officers forced him to leave the establishment, without a request from the Caribou staff, after informing him that his "kind" was not welcome there. The suit alleges the officers profiling resulted in an unlawful seizure of Mr. Hassan:<blockquote>Defendants intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly seized Plaintiff without any reasonable suspicion or probable cause.</p>

<p>The conduct of Defendants, including their threatening presence, touching of weapons, repeated language and tone of voice, and escorting of Mr. Hassan in near proximity, communicated to Mr. Hassan that he was compelled to comply with their requests that he leave the store. No reasonable person would have felt free to decline Defendants' instructions or otherwise terminate the encounter.</p>

<p>Defendants did not at any time have probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or any other legally valid basis to believe that Plaintiff had committed or was committing any violation of the law prior to seizing his person.</blockquote>The <a href="https://www.auroragov.org/departments/police">Aurora Police Department</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AuroraCOPD/posts/1604918702886366">disagrees</a> [statement] with the allegations in the complaint, but will not may any further comments pertaining to this matter. </p>

<p>The lawsuit asks for compensatory and punitive damages. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/SREnvironment/Pages/JohnKnox.aspx">John Knox</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22169&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] on Mongolia Wednesday to protect the environment. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22152&LangID=E">call </a> [transcript] came as a result of economic and cultural implications the nations agricultural community is facing as a result of expanding the expanding mining industry. Knox found that while Mongolia has comprehensive environmental legislation, it lacks a necessary implementation framework, causing damage to the environment. He also said that areas in Mongolia are some of the most polluted due to coal burning affecting the air and mining poisoning the water supply:<blockquote>This air pollution interferes with the rights to life and health because it causes respiratory and cardiopulmonary illnesses that lead to premature mortality. The effects are felt most severely by the most vulnerable, including the old and the ill. Many studies have shown that children are particularly at risk. For example, in 2016, UNICEF estimated that over 400 children under the age of five were dying every year in Ulaanbaatar as a result of pneumonia related to air pollution.  In addition, exposure to air pollution in childhood can result in long-term health problems, including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.</blockquote>He called on on Mongolia to standardize mining procedures to safeguard the environment:<blockquote>Mining standards should ensure that the mining is done safely, that it minimizes environmental harm, and that after the mining is completed, the site is restored as far as possible to its original status.  Unavoidable harm should be offset and/or compensated.  When done correctly, this process can and should result in benefits not only for the country as a whole, but also for the local communities directly affected by the mining.</blockquote>More importantly he urged Mongolia to protect indigenous land rights activists, noting recent attacks and threats of violence leveled against environmentalist and human rights defenders. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/28/trump-waives-shipping-restrictions-for-puerto-rico-for-hurricane-relief/?utm_term=.113717cfb9bc">waived</a> [WP report] the <a href="/paperchase/Jones%20Act.pdf">Jones Act</a> [text, PDF], a near-century-old law, easing shipping restrictions for hurricane relief to be sent to Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>The waiver was announced by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a tweet, which said: "At @ricardorossello request, @POTUS has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately." The president himself later tweeted that: The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site."</p>

<p>This announcement comes after the Trump administration faced some backlash for the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a>'s (DHS) [official website] statement on Monday that the law would not be suspended. Trump himself indicated that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-jones-act-maria_us_59cc281ee4b05063fe0ef7ec">law will not be waived</a> [Huffington Post report] only Wednesday saying: "We're thinking about that. ... But we have a lot of shippers and ... a lot of people who work in the shipping industry that don't want the Jones Act lifted. And we have a lot of ships out there right now."</p>

<p>The Jones Act was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/puerto-rico-crisis/what-jones-act-opponents-1920-law-argue-it-s-worsening-n805101">signed into law</a> [NBC backgrounder] by late <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/woodrowwilson">President Woodrow Wilson</a> [official profile] at the end of the first world war. The act was passed as a protectionist measure in the 1920s, with a particular focus on competition from Germany. Specifically, it restricts domestic trade to US-flagged vessels managed by an American crew. Proponents say that the law protects American jobs and boosts national security because it reduces US dependency on foreign vessels, while opponents, including <a href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/">US Senator John McCain</a> [official website], have called for its repeal stating: "It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster."</p>

<p>In addition to the waiver, the US has also dispatched USNS Comfort, a hospital ship that has responded to other natural disasters, to Puerto Rico. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>South Africa court: political parties must disclose sources of private funding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Western Cape High Court in South Africa on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/South%20Africa%20Ruling%20-%20political%20parties%20must%20disclose%20sources%20of%20private%20funding.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that parliament must amend the <a href="/paperchase/PAIA.pdf">Promotion of Access to Information Act</a> (PAIA) [text, PDF] to compel political parties in South Africa to disclose the sources of their private funding.  </p>

<p>The plaintiff in this case was a nonprofit organization named <a href="https://www.myvotecounts.org.za/">My Vote Counts</a> (MVC) [advocacy website] that sought a declaration that "information about the private funding of political parties is reasonably required for the effective exercise of the right to vote" per § 19(3)(a) of <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng-02.pdf">South Africa Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and that the PAIA is "inconsistent" with the constitution because it fails to achieve the targeted goal of "continuous and systematic recordal and disclosure of private funding information of political parties." </p>

<p>The court analyzed and discussed the issue in three parts: 1) right to information and right to vote, 2) the need for information on private funding as it relates to the right to vote, and the 3) the constitutional implications and international agreements in the context of the country's duty to prevent corruption. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff on all of these points and rejected the defendant's contention that "private funding disclosure would deprive donors of the choice as to which parties to associate with" due to fear of reprisal by the ruling party.</p>

<p>The case was initially filed with the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court of South Africa</a>, which dismissed the case stating that the plaintiff should have approached the High Court. While that Court's majority did not consider the merits of the case, its minority opinion discussed the merits at length, which was subsequently quoted by the high court with approval in ruling for the plaintiff:<blockquote>§ 19(1) of the Constitution envisages that every citizen is free to make political choices. ... It also includes, of course, the freedom to choose one's leaders. But that choice, like all others, is valuable only if one knows what one is choosing. ... Does this include knowing the private sources of political parties' funding? It surely does. Private contributions to a political party are not made thoughtlessly, or without motive. They are made in the anticipation that the party will advance a particular social interest, policy or viewpoint. And political parties, in turn, depend on contributors for the very resources that allow them to conduct their democratic activities. Those resources keep flowing to the extent that they meet their contributors' and funders' expectations. There can be little doubt, then, that the identity of those contributors, and what they contribute, provides important information about the parties' likely behavior.</blockquote></p>

<p>In ruling the PAIA unconstitutional to the extent it restrains the people from making an informed vote, Judge Yasmin Shenaz Meer gave the parliament 18 months to rectify "inconsistencies" in PAIA. MVC national coordinator Janine Ogle welcomed the ruling and <a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/party-funding-judgment-confirms-voters-right-to-be-informed-applicant-20170927">acknowledged</a> [News24 report] that the parliament has already begun the process to rectify the defects in PAIA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/092817zr_9o6b.pdf">11 cases</a> [order list, PDF] on Thursday. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-961-cert-petition.pdf">Dalmazzi v. United States</a> [cert. petition, PDF] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-1017.html">Cox v. United States</a> [docket], and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16-1423-Ortiz-Petition.pdf">Ortiz v. United States</a> [cert. petition, PDF] are three cases that will be consolidated and will be given one hour each for oral argument. These cases deal with whether active-duty military officers can serve on the Court of Military Commissions Review (CMCR). The petitioners were members of the Air Force who were <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/09/justices-issue-orders-long-conference/">convicted</a> [SCOTUSblog report] of different crimes in a military court. They are appealing their convictions on the grounds that only members of the military can preside over a military court, and the judges in the petitioners' cases were civilians because of their CMCR position. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-1027-cert-petition.pdf">Collins v. Virginia</a> [cert. petition, PDF] deals with whether the Fourth Amendment's automobile exception includes a police officer searching a vehicle without a warrant that is parked on the suspect's property. The petitioner appealed his conviction for receiving stolen property, claiming that the police did not constitutionally obtain evidence.   </p>

<p>The question in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-1150-cert-petition.pdf">Hall v. Hall</a> [cert. petition, PDF] is whether, when multiple cases are consolidated, a decision in a single one of those cases triggers a time limit for appeals if all the cases consolidated are from the same district. The claim arose from a mother bringing tort litigation against her son and his law firm.   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16-1362-petition.pdf">Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro</a> [cert. petition, PDF] addresses whether "service advisors" at a car dealership are entitled to overtime pay when the Fair Labor Standards Act exempts "any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles." Respondents are service advisors who are seeking overtime pay. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-415_mlho.pdf">heard and remanded</a> [opinion, PDF] this case in spring 2016.  </p>

<p>The question in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/16-1371-petition.pdf">Byrd v. United States</a> [cert. petition, PDF] is whether a the driver of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy when he has permission to drive the rental car but is not listed as a driver on the agreement. Petitioner was driving a car his girlfriend had rented for him when the police pulled him over for a traffic violation. They searched his car without suspicion or warrant. While a police officer may not conduct a "suspicionless and warrantless" search when a driver has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the government asserts that there was no expectation of privacy because petitioner's name was not on the rental agreement. Petitioner appealed his conviction.  </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Janus-Cert-Petition-FINAL.pdf">Janus v. American Federation</a> [cert. petition, PDF] the court will decide whether it will overrule a previous decision that it is constitutional for the government to force its employees to join unions. The petitioner is an Illinois state employee who is being compelled to pay union fees.  </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16-1495-petition.pdf">City of Hays v. Vogt</a> [opinion, PDF] a police officer admitted to appropriating a knife from work, sparking a criminal investigation. At issue is whether the police department using statements made at the probable cause hearing was unconstitutional on the basis of self incrimination. </p>

<p>At issue in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-8255.html">McCoy v. Louisiana</a> [docket] is whether it is unconstitutional for an attorney to concede a defendant's guilt without a defendant's approval. The defendant was convicted of three first-degree murders and sentenced to death.</p>

<p>In Rosales-Mireles v. United States the court will decide what standard to use when correcting a district court's error. The petitioner pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the US, but the district court calculated his jail sentence incorrectly. The circuit court said that the error was not severe enough to correct.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China's commerce ministry also announced that this would include any joint ventures with Chinese firms, but they must end before the January deadline, precisely 120 days from September 11. This order does not apply to non-profit, non-commercial entities, but the exemption must have governmental approval.</p>

<p>This announcement comes as China's ministry has <a href="http://zhongshan2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/activity/201709/20170902650521.shtml">recently been negotiating</a> [press release] with the US over trade relations and North Korea. Tensions between the US and China have risen over recent months over criticism on trade, North Korea and deteriorating relations between the countries.</p>

<p>China has been very vocal about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/world/asia/north-korea-china-nuclear.html">possible consequences</a> [NYT report] to North Korea and the US' actions. China had also previously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-bristles-at-us-imposed-sanctions-on-north-korea-trade/2017/08/23/32bfba3c-87ba-11e7-9ce7-9e175d8953fa_story.html?utm_term=.9d344d38a857">demanded</a> [WP report] that the US immediately withdraw sanctions on North Korea in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] DeJenay Beckwith, a woman who was sexually assault in 2011, has filed a <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/images/main_images/Beckwith_v._Houston2.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas </a>[official wesbite] against the city of <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov">Houston</a> [official website] for the city's backlog of rape kit tests. </p>

<p>Beckwith was sexually assaulted in her home in 2011. Immediately after the assailant was chased away by one of Beckwith's friends, she contacted the Houston Police Department who took her to a local hospital in order to administer a rape test kit. According to Beckwith, that kit was not tested until 2016, over five years after the incident. </p>

<p>Once the kit was tested, it was revealed that the assailant was a man by the name of David Lee Cooper, a convicted rapist whose DNA was on file with the FBI since 1991. Other kits that were tested years after they were taken revealed that David Lee Cooper had victimized numerous women in the Houston area. </p>

<p>Beckwith is alleging that Houston officials knew of the backlog going as far back as 1991 and failed to address the issue. The complaint alleges that such conduct is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The suit is also seeking class action status for other affected woman.</p>

<p>There are currently similar backlogs in numerous states across the country. Wisconsin has a backlog of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/09/11/wisconsin-untested-rape-kits-child-victims/656041001/#">roughly 6,000 rape kits</a> [USA Today report]. Iowa has a backlog of <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sexually_assaulted_texas_woman_files_civil_rights_action_regarding_rape_kit">more than 4,000 rape kits dating back to 1990</a> [Des Moines Register report]. According to <a href="http://www.endthebacklog.org">End The Backlog</a>, an initiative started by the <a href="http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org">Joyful Heart Foundation</a> [advocacy websites], there are hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits across the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Washington state sues Purdue Pharma over opioid epidemic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Washington sued <a href="http://www.purduepharma.com/">Purdue Pharma</a> in <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/courts/superior-court.aspx">King County Superior Court</a> [official websites] on Thursday alleging the pharmaceutical company is responsible for the opioid epidemic growth. </p>

<p>Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed the <a href="http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/Washington%20v%20Purdue%20Complaint%209-28-17.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], alleging Purdue and other pharmaceutical corporations used deceptive advertising to increase opioid prescription sales. The lawsuit accuses Purdue of using such deceptive tactics for two decades, including acts deceiving Oxycontin's addictiveness, consumer's ability to manage addiction and abuse risks, and claims that Oxycontin improves function.</p>

<p>The defendants are accused of violating the Consumer Protection Act, creating a public nuisance and acting negligently, thereby contributing to the opioid crisis in Washington, which has led to 700 deaths since 2006. </p>

<p>This is not the first lawsuit Washington filed against Purdue for alleged deceptive marketing tactics. In 2007 Washington and 25 other states filed a lawsuit against Purdue which ended with a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/washington-state-ag-bob-ferguson-seattle-sue-oxycontin-maker-over-opioid-deaths/">court order</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] prohibiting "Purdue from understating risks of abuse and addiction, and also required the company to take action when it became aware of overprescribing 'pill mills.'"</p>

<p>The current lawsuit makes Washington the tenth state to file a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chief Judge Brian Jackson of the <a href="https://www.lamd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website], held Thursday that a police officer could not sue Black Lives Matter (BLM) for injuries sustained during a protest on July 9, 2016 because BLM is not an entity. </p>

<p>An unnamed police officer filed the lawsuit after the July 17, 2016, BLM protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during which a rock was thrown at the officer. </p>

<p>The officer named BLM as well as several individuals associated with BLM as defendants, including DeRay McKeeson, a BLM activist and leader. </p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.lamd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/16cv72RulingandOrderforPublication.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] Jackson said BLM is not an entity and cannot be sued. Additionally, he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-louisiana-blacklivesmatter/black-lives-matter-movement-cannot-be-sued-u-s-judge-rules-idUSKCN1C338S">dismissed</a> [Reuters report] McKeeson as a Defendant because McKeeson cannot be liable for criminal conduct of an unidentified person:<blockquote>Moreover, to premise Mckesson's liability on the sole basis of his public statements in which he identified himself as a "leader" of the "Black Lives Matter" movement or a "participant" in various demonstrations ... would impermissibly impose liability on Mckesson for merely exercising his right of association.</blockquote>Jackson also noted that an associated entity could be sued for the officer's allegations, but the officer did not make a sufficient case concerning such entity. The officer is required to file an amended complaint or the lawsuit will be dismissed entirely. </p>

<p>This decision may affect another lawsuit filed by a police officer who was shot in the abdomen during the July 17, 2016, protest. That lawsuit currently sits before Jackson in the Middle District Court as well. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illinois <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official website] signed <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=91&GA=100&DocTypeId=HB&DocNum=0040&GAID=14&LegID=99242&SpecSess=&Session=">HB 0040</a> [text] into law Thursday, which removes many restrictions on the funding of abortions. The law adds language to the State Employees Group Insurance Act, which states "reproductive health care that is otherwise legal in Illinois shall be covered under the medical assistance program for persons who are otherwise eligible for medical assistance under this Article." </p>

<p>The law removes the restriction that did not allow the non-contributory portion of the program of health benefits from being used to perform abortions. It also removes a requirement that any claim for reimbursement for abortions be accompanied by a written statement of a physician. Restrictions removing physicians from the list of physicians qualified to participate as a vendor of medical services under the medical assistance program if they had performed an abortion procedure on a woman who was not pregnant was also removed by the law.</p>

<p>The law now allows grants to nonprofit agencies and organizations even if they refer or counsel for or perform abortions. It also removes language which stated that the General Assembly of Illinois declared that an unborn child is a legal person from the time of conception.</p>

<p>Abortion rights in the US have been a heavily contested topic for many years. In June the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state was immune from litigation regarding a lawsuit challenging a 20-week abortion ban law. Also in June the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill guaranteeing abortion access and lifting any restrictions on abortions prior to the stage where a fetus reaches viability. The Delaware bill was <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/25736">signed</a> [Bill Status] into law by Delaware's Governor on June 8.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=47383">released a set of guidelines</a> [text, PDF] and principles for online platforms to detect and remove illegal content online. The guidelines consider a variety of illegal online content, including terrorism-related material, illegal hate speech, child sexual abuse material, and material related to trafficking in human beings, in addition to violations to intellectual property, illegal commercial practices online, and online activities of a defamatory nature.</p>

<p>One guideline recommends online platforms to appoint points of contacts in the EU between the platforms and law enforcement authorities in order to increase effective cooperation. It also recommends the increase of cooperation between online platforms and "trusted flaggers" or illegal content. The European Commission will be exploring the potential to develop agreed upon criteria for the definition of trusted flaggers.</p>

<p>The Commission also recommends online platforms to develop technology to automatically ensure that previously removed content is not re-uploaded. It also recommends methods of expediting removal of material where serious harm is at stake. This can involve fully automated deletion, or expedited removal from trusted flaggers.</p>

<p>Online platforms are also recommended to ensure that any criminal or other offences be reported to law enforcement authorities. Law enforcement authorities are then recommended to increase their capacity in order to take appropriate actions on the reports from the online platforms.</p>

<p>Increases in transparency from the online platforms is also recommended. This includes having "clear, easily understandable and sufficiently detailed explanation of their content policy in their terms of service." The online platforms should also publish reports related to the number and type of notices received and actions taken. There should also be a method to contest decisions of the online platform for removing content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The regulation will take effect October 5, but there are exceptions to the rule that must be cleared by the individual site and/or the FAA. There will be an interactive map available to those visiting the sites to ensure they are aware of the restricted locations. Those who violate the regulation will be potentially subject to possible civil fines or criminal charges.</p>

<p>Other current FAA no-fly zones include army bases, major airports and specific sports stadiums.

<p>Other sentences include life in prison for Ha Van Tham, former Chairman of Ocean bank. The 51 officials and bankers who stood trial were accused of mismanagement <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41439866">leading to losses</a> [BBC report] of USD $69 million. The charges implicated dozens of the men down the ranks, targeting accountants and branch managers. </p>

<p>The presiding Judge, Truong Viet Toan, <a href="http://www.gulf-times.com/story/565544/Vietnam-ex-banker-sentenced-to-death-in-fraud-saga">said</a> [Gulf Times report], the serious nature of the crimes required strict punishment.</p>

<p>Many analysts see caution that the corruption crackdown might be targeting opponents of Communist Party chief <a href="http://nguyenphutrong.org/">Nguyen Phu Trong</a> [official website]. Lawyers for Nguyen Xuan Son have stated that he will appeal the decision in the coming months. </p>]]></content:encoded>
