Khadr <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/khadr-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] last week to all five charges against him, including murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and espionage, agreeing to serve an eight-year sentence. He will serve only one year of his sentence at Guantanamo and will then be able to apply to be transferred to Canada and will be eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence. According to a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/cs-shareit/CommunityServer.Components.PostAttachments/00/00/77/06/31/Khadr+diplomatic+notes.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=0TTXDM86AJ1CB68A7P02&Expires=1288625456&Signature=I3ezd11hZuWqktUpYwT9PPpSYbo%3d">diplomatic note agreement</a> [materials, PDF] between the US and Canada, Khadr's application will be "favourably" considered. Khadr is the fifth person to be convicted by a Guantanamo military court, but is the first to be charged with murder and convicted for a crime committed as a juvenile. Khadr was charged at the age of 15, after he was captured following a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002 in which he threw a hand grenade that killed one US soldier and wounded another. In addition to pleading guilty, Khadr signed a <a href="http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/archive/00966/Omar_Khadr_s_signed_966981a.pdf">stipulation of fact</a> [text, PDF] confirming that he was a member of al Qaeda, that he threw the grenade and that he felt "happy" when he learned an American soldier had been killed.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/index.html">UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict</a> [official website] urged the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-childrens-rights-expert-urges-us-not-to-imprison-khadr.php">not to imprison</a> [JURIST report] Khadr. <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/radhikacoomaraswamy.html">Radhika Coomaraswamy</a> [official profile], through a letter sent to the US military commission, stated that Khadr meets the classic qualifications for being considered a child solider and that returning him to Canada for rehabilitation would be a better outcome than a US prison. Khadr's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-military-judge-postpones-khadr-trial-while-lawyers-seek-deal.php">postponed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] while lawyers for both sides attempted to reach a plea agreement. In late August, the military judge rejected Khadr's claim that his confession was a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rejects-khadr-torture-claims.php">byproduct of torture</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in August, the same judge ruled that Khadr's confession was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rules-khadr-confessions-admissible-at-trial.php">admissible at trial</a> [JURIST report]. Canada had previously declined to seek Khadr's <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">repatriation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-banning-violent-video-game-sales-to-minors.php">report</a>] on whether a party may appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits if the party chose not to appeal the order before trial. Petitioner Michelle Ortiz was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer in prison and then placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for reporting the assault. She brought a &#167; 1983 claim against respondents Paula Jordan, a case manager at the prison, and Rebecca Bright, who was responsible for Ortiz's time in solitary confinement. The district court denied respondents' motion for summary judgment, and they went ahead with trial without appealing. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Ortiz more than $600,000. Jordan and Bright subsequently appealed the denial of summary judgment. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0196n-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that, "although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits, denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule." Counsel for Ortiz argued, "Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal after trial, especially where the decision depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for liability." Counsel for the respondents argued for the qualified immunity exception.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-846.pdf">United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-hear-copyright.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1500.html">28 USC &#167; 1500</a> [text] deprives the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Federal Claims</a> (CFC) [official website] of jurisdiction over a claim seeking monetary relief for the government's alleged violation of fiduciary obligations if the plaintiff has another suit pending in federal district court based on substantially the same operative facts, especially when the plaintiff seeks monetary relief or other overlapping relief in the two suits. 28 USC &#167; 1500 provides that the CFC lacks jurisdiction over "any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff has any suit or process against the United States" or its agents "pending in any other court." The Tohono O'odham Nation filed a complaint against the US in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, and, one day later, it filed a similar complaint against the US in the CFC. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-5043.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the CFC's dismissal of the case, concluding "that the Nation's complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeks relief that is different from the relief sought in its earlier-filed district court action." Counsel for the US government argued:<blockquote>The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section 1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits seek the same relief, and that the critical distinction in this regard is whether the particular relief in the plaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or equitable. Section 1500's text broadly bars CFC jurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has pending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim or is merely a suit in respect to that claim. In other words, another suit for a different but a related claim will trigger section 1500.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued, "Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the same operative facts and seek duplicative relief."</p>]]></content:encoded>

A German-based international licensing service owned by a Turkish citizen reportedly <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkey-lifts-ban-on-access-to-youtube-2010-10-31">bought the rights to the videos</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report] that allegedly insulted Turkey's founder, <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [<em>Turkish News</em> profile], and removed them on Friday. Insulting Ataturk is a criminal offense in Turkey, punishable by prison sentence. After confirming with the police department that the disputed content had been taken down, the prosecutor's office ordered the Telecommunication Transmission Directorate (TIB), which controls Internet accessibility in Turkey, to enable YouTube for Turkish Internet users. The <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] <a href="http://www.osce.org/item/47435.html">welcomed</a> [press release] the lifting of the ban, encouraging Turkey to "continue in this direction by reforming its Internet law and lift remaining website bans." More than 4,000 websites remain banned in Turkey.

<p>The ban on YouTube was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/turkish-court-reimposes-youtube-ban-for.php">implemented</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 after insulting clips of Ataturk were discovered on the site. Earlier this year, the TIB also placed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-government-restricts-google-services.php">ban on certain Google sites</a> [JURIST report], which made it difficult for Turkish citizens to access YouTube indirectly. Turkish President Abdullah Gul <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-president-criticizes-ban-on-google-services.php">criticized these bans</a> [JURIST report] on his Twitter account and called for them to be lifted. The OSCE has repeated called on Turkey to bring its penal code in line with OSCE commitments and international standards. Specifically, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=ENGEUR440352005">Article 301</a> [AI Backgrounder] of the Turkish penal code, which criminalizes insulting "Turkishness," has been criticized for too-strictly limiting free speech, a limitation that is seen as a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eu-report-on-turkey-accession-cites.php">stumbling block</a> [JURIST report] for Turkey's admittance to the EU.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Kanyarukiga was <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Kanyarukiga/indictment/Kanyarukiga.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] in 2001 for his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1288230.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>] and faced charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. The charges arose from events in which the former businessman is said to have planned and supervised large-scale killings of Tutsis in Rwanda's Kibuye prefecture through a conspiracy with police and government officials. Specifically, the court highlighted Kanyarukiga's involvement with the church massacre in Nyange that killed more than 2,000 Tutsi victims, which triggered the charge of extermination as a crime against humanity. A court spokesperson said:<blockquote>the Chamber was satisfied that the demolition of the Nyange Church was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against the Tutsi civilian population on ethnic grounds and that the accused knew that his acts formed part of this broader attack. The Chamber also found that the accused intentionally participated in a mass killing of Tutsi civilians amounting to extermination as a crime against humanity.</blockquote>In light of the genocide conviction, the ICTR acquitted Kanyarukiga on the charge of complicity of genocide because the conviction negates the charge of complicity. The ICTR sentenced the 65-year-old Kanyarukiga to 30 years in prison for his crimes.

<p>The ICTR continues its work to prosecute those most responsible for the Rwandan genocide, but its work is hampered by a lack of resources, leading the tribunal to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-war-crimes-tribunals-ask-general-assembly-for-more-resources.php">ask the UN for assistance</a> [JURIST report] in October. In September, the ICTR opened the trial of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-opens-trial-of-ex-mayor.php">former Kivumu mayor</a> [JURIST report], charged in connection with deaths at a church in that town in April 1994. The tribunal has faced adversity since its creation, including the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ictr-defense-lawyer-shot-dead.php">shooting death</a> [JURIST report] of one of the senior defense lawyers in July.  Earlier this year, Joseph Nzirorea, former president of the Rwanda National Assembly and secretary general of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-ex-official-dies-while-facing-genocide-trial-at-ictr.php">died while on trial</a> [JURIST report] for conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions#a2">Geneva Conventions</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were convicted on charges of committing acts of piracy against Yemeni fishing boats. Three other individuals were also tried but were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hbP4Aue2kXsHInDJ8QvHqy4wKzug?docId=CNG.ca8bb9cfd7fdda08bb93f4677370519a.761">acquitted</a> [AFP report] for lack of evidence. The 13 individuals were originally arrested in October 2009 in the Gulf of Aden, an area where <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] remains a serious problem despite international efforts to curb it. The men were tried in a specialized criminal court created in 1999 by an <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/showlaws.php?_lwbkno=3&_lwptno=1&_lwnmid=344">executive order</a> [text, in Arabic] from Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh to handle issues involving piracy, terrorism and hostage-taking. Earlier this month in Yemen, the trial began for 13 other Somali pirates accused of seizing Yemeni boats to use in launching attacks on merchant vessels, with the prosecution demanding the death penalty.

<p>The international community has been supporting actions taken against maritime piracy, but the UN has recently had to call for nations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-urges-nations-to-assist-kenya-in-conducting-piracy-trials.php">assist Kenya in conducting piracy trials</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would spend more than USD $9.3 million to fund courts that prosecute suspected Somali pirates. This action came in response to the Kenyan government's announcement in April that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer accept</a> [JURIST report] Somali pirate cases due to its overburdened legal system. The month of April also saw the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-security-council-urges-international.php">approve a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling on member states to criminalize piracy under their domestic laws as well as an announcement from the UN that a trust fund established to combat piracy will be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34472&Cr=somali&Cr1=">funding five projects</a> [UN News Centre report] in an effort to help Somalia and its neighbors reduce acts of piracy committed in nearby bodies of water.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-11121.htm">JDB v. North Carolina</a> [docket], the court will determine whether a juvenile student who incriminated himself while being questioned by law enforcement officers was in custody and therefore entitled to the safeguards set forth in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0384_0436_ZS.html">Miranda v.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/sc/opinions/2009/pdf/190-09-1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the student was not in custody when he made incriminating statements and therefore not entitled to the protections of Miranda or the North Carolina statute.

<p>The court will also hear the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1159.htm">Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/09-1159_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], to determine whether the rights of universities under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Dole Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212] to inventions arising from federally funded research can be terminated by the individual inventors through separate agreements assigning the inventor's rights to a third party. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1509r.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Roche possesses an ownership interest in the patents at issue, depriving Stanford's standing to sue. The appeals court also remanded the case to the US District Court for the Northern District of California, finding that the trial court incorrectly failed to consider Roche's affirmative defense based on ownership of the patents in issue.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-11328.htm">Davis v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pet.09-11328.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] exclusionary rule requires the suppression of evidence obtained from a search permitted by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1195174.html">United States v. Gonzalez</a> [opinion text], after the court overturned Gonzalez in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-542.pdf">Arizona v. Gant</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-iran-compensation.php">report</a>]. The Eleventh Circuit refused to apply the exclusionary rule, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200816654.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that the search was objectively reasonable when relying on the then-binding precedent and that the good faith exception allows the use of evidence obtained under reasonable reliance on well-settled precedent.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-10.htm">Turner v. Price</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Pet.10-10.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether an indigent defendant has a constitutional right to appoint counsel at a civil contempt proceeding resulting in his imprisonment. The Supreme Court of South Carolina <a href="http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26793">held</a> [opinion text] that, because the incarceration of the defendant was not a permanent or unconditional loss of liberty as he can avoid it by complying with the court's orders, he does not maintain the constitutional right to appointed counsel. The court will also consider whether it has jurisdiction to review the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court, ordering the parties to submit briefs on the issue.</p>

<p>The court will also hear the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-114.htm">Fox v. Vice</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Pet.10-114.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001988----000-.html">42 USC &#167; 1988</a> [text] permits the court to award defendants attorney's fees based on an action dismissing a claim when the plaintiff also asserts non-frivolous claims. The court will also consider if it is improper to award defendants the full amount of attorney's fees incurred while defending non-frivolous claims along with a frivolous claim. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C08/08-31135-CV0.wpd.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the granting of attorney's fees.</p>

<p>Additionally, the court requested the Acting Solicitor General to submit views on <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-218.htm">PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Pet.10-218.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and Crane v. Atwell. Montana presents the question of if the constitutional test for determining whether a section of the river is navigable for title purposes requires a trial court to determine if the relevant stretch of the river was navigable at the time the state joined the Union. The Supreme Court of Montana <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/OpBelow.PPlMT_.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the title to the riverbeds passed to Montana when it became a state in 1889 and that the riverbeds are public trust lands under Article X, Section 11. Addressing the question of whether a State's attempt to claim title and impose rent obligations for use of the riverbeds is preempted when a hydropower project is licensed under the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/fedpowr.html">Federal Power Act</a> [text], the court additionally affirmed the lower court's finding of damages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-272.htm">Crane v. Atwell</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pet.10-272.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] presents the question of whether federal law preempts the litigation of state court claims based on work related asbestos exposure where the employment and exposure occurs in a railroad maintenance facility. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/OpPosting/Superior/out/a25036_09.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that no federal preemption occurs because <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Health and Safety Administration</a> (OSHA) [official website] regulations apply.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1031.htm">Wong v. Smith</a> [docket].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has argued that parts of the law are unconstitutional while others are preempted by federal law. John Bouma, representing Arizona and Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website], argued that the state is on the front line of human and drug trafficking from Mexico, and the law is meant to assist with the enforcement and implementation of federal immigration law when the federal government is either "unable or unwilling to solve the problem." Representing the federal government, Edwin Kneedler argued that allowing states to create immigration laws could create a patchwork system and potentially harm foreign relations.

<p>Brewer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/us/02immig.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">attended the proceedings</a> [NYT report] to support Arizona's law on the day before her bid seeking re-election. Polls show that she is comfortably ahead. Brewer <a href="http://janbrewer.com/article/ninth-circuit-court-hearing-on-sb-1070">defended</a> [press release] Arizona's position on her website: <blockquote>With a federal government that cannot or will not do its job, Arizona determined that Arizona law enforcement officers would assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws to the full extent permitted by federal law. The District Court applied the wrong legal standard of review and issued a preliminary injunction that preserves the status quo - a status quo that is unacceptable to the people lawfully present in Arizona, many whose lives are affected on a daily basis.</blockquote>Regardless of the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the case is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Last month, US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] <a href="http://www.ice.gov/about/leadership/asstsec_bio/john_morton.htm">Director John Morton</a> [official profile] announced that the US government has <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-announces-record-number-of-deportations-in-2010.php">deported a record number of illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST report] during 2010. In September, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-dismisses-police-officer-suit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">granted a motion to dismiss</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-dismisses-police-officer-suit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] a police officer's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the law. Brewer and Arizona have fiercely defended the law despite its controversial nature, appealing to the Ninth Circuit a July ruling of the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoining</a> [JURIST report] its enforcement. In July, soon after the injunction was issued, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ninth-circuit-denies-appeal-to-expedite-immigration-law-hearing.php">denied</a> Arizona's request for <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/arizona-appeals-order-partially-blocking-immigration-law.php">expedited appeal</a> [JURIST reports]. The preliminary injunction came at the request of the DOJ, which originally filed suit challenging the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">constitutionality of the law</a> [JURIST report] in July. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement comes the day after a panel of seven senior US military officers on Sunday <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/khadr-sentenced-by-military-jury.php">sentenced Khadr to 40 years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. He will only serve eight years as part of his plea agreement last week where he <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/khadr-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST reports] to all five charges against him, including murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and espionage. Cannon told the House of Commons that the Toronto-born Khadr will return to Canada but continued to insist that Canada was <a href="http://www.thestar.com/specialsections/omarkhadr/article/884127--canada-agrees-to-take-back-khadr?bn=1">not involved in the plea negotiations</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report]. However, a released US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department </a> [official website] <a href="http://www.thestar.com/staticcontent/883838">memorandum</a> [text] shows that the US suggested that Khadr be transferred to Canada to finish his sentence as part of the plea agreement. Canadians are split on whether Khadr should serve part of his sentence in Canada. A <a href="http://www.globalmontreal.com/world/Khadr+serve+jail+term+Canada+Cannon+confirms/3759858/story.html">poll estimated that 49 percent</a> [<em>Global Montreal</em> report] of the population was not in favor of the move.

<p>The Harper administration previously declined to seek the repatriation of Khadr despite a <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2010/2010scc3/2010scc3.html">ruling</a> [judgment text, JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] that the interrogation of Khadr by Canadian officials while in detention violated <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. Canadian officials questioned Khadr, who was captured at age 15, despite knowing that he was being indefinitely detained and had been subjected to sleep deprivation by US authorities. Still, the court held that forcing the government to press for Khadr's return was not an appropriate remedy, as such an order would overreach the court's authority. At trial, Khadr had argued that his confession was a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rejects-khadr-torture-claims.php">byproduct of torture</a> the judge ruled that Khadr's confession was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rules-khadr-confessions-admissible-at-trial.php">admissible at trial</a> [JURIST reports]. Khadr was arrested and charged at the age of 15 after he was captured following a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002 in which he threw a hand grenade that killed one US soldier and wounded another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judges agreed with the government that the district court's injunction would "seriously disrupt ongoing and determined efforts by the administration to devise an orderly change of policy" and would result in "immediate harm" and "irreparable injury" to the military. The <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website], the conservative gay activist organization that brought the suit, <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/news_views/reading-room-back-up/dont-ask-don-t-tell-legal-action/obama-administration-succeeds.html">expressed its "disappointment"</a> [press release] in the Ninth Circuit's decision:<blockquote>Despite this temporary setback, Log Cabin remains confident that we will ultimately prevail on behalf of servicemembers' constitutional rights. In the meantime, we urge President Obama to use his statutory stop-loss power to halt discharges under this discriminatory and wasteful policy. The president claims to want to see "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" ended. It is time that he stop talking and start working to make a real difference for gay and lesbian Americans by pushing for repeal when Congress returns.</blockquote> The order will remain in effect until the court resolves the <a href="http://www.lcrga.com/news/Gays-Military-Dont-Ask-Tell-DADT/201007091245.shtml">suit</a> [LCR backgrounder]. 

<p>Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy. In September, a federal judge for the US <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">District for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that a US Air Force officer be reinstated after being previous discharged under DADT.

Seifzadeh was <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Prominent_Iranian_Rights_Lawyer_Sentenced_To_Nine_Years_In_Prison/2207212.html">charged</a> [RFE/RL report] with acting against national security in establishing the <a href="http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Defender of Human Rights Center</a> (DHRC) [advocacy website], an organization that issues regular reports about human rights violations in Iran. DHRC's co-founders, Nobel Prize winner <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=soltani">Abdolfatah Soltani</a> [JURIST news archives] and Mohammed Ali Dadkhah are being similarly charged.

<p>Seifzadeh has worked on several high-profile cases, including <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2010/07/massoumeh-yavaris-lawyer-i-hope-my-client-is-acquitted/">defending</a> [Iran Human Rights report] Massoumeh Yavari, a woman in Iran charged with enmity against God for carrying a pocket-knife in her purse.

Seifzadeh's conviction is one in a series of measures taken against human rights lawyers, journalists and activists since the controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">2009 presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. In September, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist arrested following the election, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iran-court-sentences-journalist-charged-with-warring-against-god-to-six-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to six years in prison for warring against God, conspiracy to commit a crime and propaganda against the government.

The details of the report, "Kept in the Dark," are based on the testimony of 121 Palestinians held in the detention facility in 2009. The report, which details the treatment of Palestinian detainees held by Shin Bet in the Petach-Tikva interrogation facility, says that in 30 percent of the cases, physical violence is used towards the detainees, either during the initial arrest or on the way to the detention facility. This alleged torture and ill-treatment violates several international legal instruments such as the Geneva Conventions, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and the Rome Statute. The practices also violate a 1999 Israeli Supreme Court decision, which held that Shin Bet interrogations must be held in a "reasonable and fair manner, without violating the detainee's dignity." The report explained:<blockquote>The acts described in this report as the routine practice in interrogations at the Shin Bet facility in Petach-Tikva breach the absolute prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. There are also cases in the report that caused severe suffering that amounts to torture. Alongside the general prohibition on torture and on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, Israel's handling and treatment of the detainees as revealed in this report breaches various codes regarding detention conditions.</blockquote>The Israeli Justice Ministry has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=193627">denied the allegations</a> [JP report], claiming that Israel's military procedures respect the law.

<p>Israel has faced repeated criticism by human rights organizations for its treatment of Palestinian detainees. In June 2009, the <a href="http://www.stoptorture.org.il/en">Public Committee Against Torture in Israel</a> (PCATI) [advocacy website] alleged that shackling techniques used by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet against Palestinian detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/israel-detainee-shackling-practices.php">unjustifiably harsh and constituted torture</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2008, PCATI alleged that <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israeli-rights-group-says-military.php">Israeli soldiers regularly beat</a> [JURIST report] and abuse Palestinian detainees even after they have been arrested and no longer pose a threat. PCATI said military violence against detainees is "reinforced by a weak legal system which conducts only a small number of investigations and legal proceedings that concern cases of abuse by soldiers." The Israeli military has denied treating prisoners in any way prohibited by national or international law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In February, Bordaberry was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uruguay-ex-president-sentenced-to-30.php">sentenced to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the country's 1973 military coup.

<p>The Yemeni government desires to be considered an ally of the US in the fight against terrorism. However, some groups in the US fear the consequences in the case of Awlaki. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] questioning the legality of targeted killings of terrorist suspects by the US was filed in August by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy websites]. In September, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-invokes-state-secrets-in-effort-to-block-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">asked the court to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit arguing that the matter involves "non-justiciable political questions" to be decided by the executive branch and that litigation could divulge state secrets. In early August, the ACLU and the CCR obtained a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) license that enables them to represent Awlaki, but announced they are <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/treasury-department-to-issue-license-for-terror-suspect-defense.php">still pursuing a legal challenge</a> [JURIST reports] to the licensing scheme.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Delivering two reports to the UN General Assembly, Maugai said that states must enforce internationally recognized standards and prevent discrimination. Muigai identified immigrants in particular as bearing the brunt of xenophobic intolerance and warned against characterizing migration as a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A055U20101101">problem and threat to social cohesion</a> [Reuters report]. Queried about Arizona's recent controversial immigration law, Muigai indicated he felt it equipped the police with too much power to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/01/AR2010110106535.html">compromise fundamental human rights</a> [WP report]. He called on states to condemn extremist organizations promoting or inciting racial discrimination and acknowledged that passing anti-discrimination legislation alone was not enough. Muigai is set to travel to Bolivia in the coming weeks.

<p>On Monday, a US appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-immigration-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials] after issuing an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] in July preventing its enforcement pending appeal. In October, <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/">Bolivian President Evo Morales</a> [official profile, in Spanish] signed a controversial bill into law that permits the government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/bolivia-president-signs-controversial-anti-racism-bill-into-law.php">punish media outlets for publishing racist content</a> [JURIST report]. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/bolivia-newspapers-protest-proposed-racism-law.php">widely protested</a> [JURIST report] by Bolivian media outlets. In September, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] warned France that the country would face disciplinary proceedings and potential legal action if it did not follow EU regulations in its relations with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma</a> [JURIST news archive] migrants after <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">French President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-president-announces-new-measures-against-illegal-roma.php">ordered measures against illegal Roma communities</a> [JURIST report] in July and announced new legislation aimed at making their deportation easier. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/default_en.asp">European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance</a> (ECRI) [official website] reported that <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/Annual%20report%202009.pdf">racist violence and rhetoric has risen</a> [report, PDF] in Europe during 2009, following the recent economic crisis.

Prosecutors allege that Khodorkovsky and a group of investors embezzled more than $100 million from his former company <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yukos">Yukos</a> [JURIST news archive]. Addressing the court, Khodorkovsky said: <blockquote>Your Honour! There is much more than just the fates of two people in your hands. Right here and right now, the fate of every citizen of our country is being decided. Those who, on the streets of Moscow and Chita, Peter and Tomsk, and other cities and settlements, are not counting on becoming victims of police lawlessness, who have set up a business, built a house, achieved success and want to pass it on to their children, not to raiders in uniform, and finally, - those who want to honorably carry out their duty for a fair wage, not expecting that they can be fired at any moment by corrupt bosses under just about any pretext. ... Everybody understands that your verdict in this case - whatever it will be - is going to become part of the history of Russia. </blockquote> A verdict on this case is <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Khodorkovsky_Verdict_To_Be_Delivered_On_December_15/2208257.html">anticipated on December 15</a> [RFERL report]. If convicted, Khodorkovsky could be imprisoned until 2017. Also Tuesday, Khodorkovsky's defense lawyers hinted that prosecutors are contemplating filing a <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20101102/161183796.html">third set of criminal charges</a> [RIA Novosti report] against their client and his business partner <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [JURIST news archive].

After her husband's assassination, which led to an escalation of violence that sparked the genocide, Habyarimana was transported from Rwanda by the French military and has since been living outside Paris, although the French government has twice <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/NLP/France/Habyarimana_CRR_15-2-2007.pdf">refused</a> [2007 text, PDF, in French; <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/NLP/France/Agathe_Habyarimana_Conseil_d_Etat_16-10-2009.pdf">2009 text</a>, PDF, in French] to grant her asylum as a refugee.

Counsel for California urged the court "to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games that the legislature has determined can be harmful to [their] development," drawing distinctions between video games and other media such as books, movies or music. Counsel for the respondents argued against creating any kind of First Amendment exception for violent video games. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Breyer and Alito appeared to support California's arguments while Justices Scalia, Ginsburg and Sotomayor repeatedly raised free speech concerns.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1438.pdf">Sossamon v. Texas</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-five-cases.php">report</a>] on whether an individual may sue a state or state official in his official capacity for damages for violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rluipa.com/index.php/article/398.html">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 2000cc text], which grants prisoners permission to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief against the government when it imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a inmate. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08-1438_ca5.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a grant of summary judgment in favor of Texas and ordered further proceedings to determine if Texas had exceeded its bounds under the act by prohibiting Harvey Sossamon to use the prison chapel for Christian worship, even though it was available for other uses. Counsel for Sossamon argued that damages are an appropriate remedy. Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the petitioner. Counsel for Texas argued that the ambiguous phrase "appropriate relief" does not permit damages.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-400.pdf">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-hear-copyright.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether an employer may be held liable based on the unlawful intent of officials who caused or influenced but did not make the ultimate employment decision. Vincent Staub sued his former employer under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/usc/vpl/usc38.htm">Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act</a> (USERRA) [text] for wrongful termination. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&amp;shofile=08-1316_017.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the unlawful intent of the officials who allegedly brought about Staub's dismissal could not be attributed to the employer. Counsel for Staub argued:<blockquote>The dismissal of an employee is often the result of the interrelated actions and decisions of several officials. Whether an employer is legally responsible for any particular official and his or her actions and decisions turns on agency law. Congress legislates against a background of agency law and is presumed to have intended agency principles to govern that kind of question. Agency law, not the Eleventh Circuit's "cat's paw" doctrine, is the controlling standard here.</blockquote>Counsel for the US government argued on behalf of Staub as <em>amicus curiae</em>. Counsel for the respondent argued that the Seventh Circuit applied the correct standard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the lawsuit, filed Friday in the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website], the DOI decided in August to <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/522937ca-e610-11df-9cdd-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss">limit bidders</a> [FT report] to only those using programs based on Microsoft's Business Productivity Online Suite. Google was allegedly excluded because of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11673625">security concerns</a> [BBC report], but the company says it has created a special application, Google Government Apps, that addresses all of these concerns. Furthermore, the company argues its application would save US taxpayers millions of dollars. 

<p>Over the past year, Google's privacy practices and policies have the focus of a number of investigations and complaints. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into Google's internal policies and procedures that led to the company inadvertently collecting data on unsecured wireless networks while photographing streetscapes for its Street View maps program. In October, Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart announced that Google was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF] (PIPEDA). In August, the <a href="http://www.police.go.kr/">South Korean National Police Agency</a> (SKNPA) [official website, in Korean]<a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php"> raided the Google South Korean headquarters</a> [JURIST report] in connection with accusations that the company had been illegally acquiring user data. In July, the Australian Privacy Commissioner <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that its investigation revealed Google's actions violated the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/law">Australia Privacy Act</a> [government backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In Arizona, <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/Info/PubPamphlet/english/Prop106.htm">Proposition 106</a> [text] passed <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/AZ/22333/39256/en/vts.html?cid=1645">55.4 percent to 44.6 percent</a> [unofficial results]. The amendment purports to "preserve the freedom of Arizonans to provide for their health care" by prohibiting compulsory participation in "any health care system." In Oklahoma, <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/gov/proposed_questions.aspx#sq756">Question 756</a> [materials] passed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/individual/#OKI01">65 percent to 35 percent</a> [unofficial results]. The amendment states that it will "prohibit[] making a person participate in a health care system." In Colorado, <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/filings/09-10/Original45-0910.pdf">Amendment 63</a> [text, PDF] was projected to have been rejected by voters as of 2:00 AM EST <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/individual/#COI02">53 percent to 47 percent</a> [unofficial results]. The amendment would have affirmed that "all persons ... have the right to health care choice" by disallowing the required participation in health insurance plan. A similar provision was <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/politics-elections/126801-states-hold-referendums-on-individual-mandate">set to appear on the ballot in Florida as well</a> [The <em>Hill</em> report], but was removed by a state judge due the misleading ballot language. The enforceability of these provisions has been questioned due to their conflict with federal law, which preempts state law under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> [text].

<p>In August, Missouri voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/missouri-voters-pass-law-seeking-to-bar-health-care-mandate.php">approved a similar ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] with 71.1 percent of the vote. Similar laws have been passed by the legislatures of Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST report]. The health care law has faced ongoing legal challenges since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in March. In October, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upheld the individual mandate provision</a> [JURIST report] of the law as constitutional, dismissing a lawsuit brought by the Thomas Moore Law Center. In August, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss another lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by the state of Virginia challenging the constitutionality of the same provision. In May, the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website], a small business lobby group, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">joined 20 states in a third lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the health care reform law in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In California, <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i821_initiative_09-0024_amdt_1-s.pdf">Proposition 19</a> [text, PDF], which was defeated by a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-pot-20101103-1,0,5135592.story">54-46 margin</a> [LAT report], would have legalized the sale and possession of up to one ounce of marijuana and the growth of cannabis plants for personal consumption. The proposition would also have empowered the state legislature to implement appropriate taxes on the sale of marijuana. In Arizona, <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/general/ballotmeasuretext/I-04-2010.pdf">Proposition 203</a> [text, PDF], which as of Wednesday morning was <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/elections/index.php">too close to call</a> (50.3 against, 49.7 for) [<em>Arizona Republic</em> election coverage], would authorize the possession of up to two-and-a-half ounces of marijuana, or up to 12 cannabis plants, for individuals with any of a set list of medical conditions including cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AIDS. In South Dakota, <a href="http://www.sdsos.gov/electionsvoteregistration/BallotCert/10BQCert.doc">Initiated Measure 13</a> [text, DOC], which was defeated by a <a href="http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_1ae826c6-e6f2-11df-8018-001cc4c002e0.html">63-37 margin</a> [<em>Rapid City Journal</em> report], would have authorized the cultivation and possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by individuals with certain debilitating diseases who register with the state Department of Health. In Oregon, voters rejected Ballot Measure 74 by a  <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=128878793635571300">57-43 margin</a> [<em>Portland Tribune</em> report]. That measure would have expanded the state's existing medical marijuana provisions to allow for private dispensaries. No matter what actions states take in this arena, however, marijuana is a Schedule I drug under the federal <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text], meaning it has no medically accepted use, it has a high potential for abuse and it is not considered safe for use, even under medical supervision. Under federal law, it cannot legally be prescribed by a doctor.

<p>The full legalization of marijuana in California was the most contentious of the ballot propositions, with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303467004575574450703567656.html">supporters</a> [WSJ op-ed] and those in <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/oct/18/vote-no-ganja-madness/">opposition</a> [<em>San Diego Union Tribune</em> op-ed] divided relatively evenly up to election day. Last month, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/doj-to-continue-to-prosecute-drug-crimes-regardless-of-california-vote-ap.php">continue to enforce the CSA</a> [JURIST report], even if Prop 19 had passed. California had previously decriminalized possession of less than one ounce of marijuana under <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1449_bill_20100405_amended_sen_v98.html">State Senate Bill 1449</a> [text]. Decriminalization is the process of reducing the punishment for possession of marijuana from a misdemeanor with the possibility of jail time to civil fines and/or mandatory drug education programs. In addition to California, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/01/03/police_balk_at_ticketing_marijuana_offenders/">Massachusetts</a>, Oregon, and <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2010/03/10/nh_house_considering_decriminalizing_marijuana/">10 other states</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> reports] have decriminalized possession, as has the city of Denver, Colorado. Fourteen states permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes, with <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a> [JURIST report] becoming the most recent state to approve of the use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kansas Amendment 1: Right to Bear Arms, which passed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/individual/#KSI01">89 percent to 11 percent</a> [unofficial results], will amend section 4 of the <a href="http://skyways.lib.ks.us/KSL/constitution/pdf/Constitution.pdf">Kansas Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which previously read: "The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security." The newly-amended section will now state: "A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and state, for lawful hunting and recreational use, and for any other lawful purpose." The <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-legisportal/index.do">Kansas Legislature</a> [official website] passed the resolution in March with both the state house and senate meeting the requisite two-thirds majority in time to include the measure on the November ballot.

The <a href="http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1663">amendment</a> [summary, PDF] sought to define five exceptions to a general prohibition against exercising eminent domain to transfer property from one private party to another. In addition, the amendment defined "fair market value" and "just compensation" and shielded parties involved in eminent domain proceedings from being held liable for the other party's attorney's fees.

<p>The measure would have repealed section 22, know as the People's Initiative to Stop the Taking of Our Land (PISTOL), which <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eminent-domain-restrictions-approved.php">passed in 2006</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nevada-restricts-eminent-domain-ohio.php">2008</a> [JURIST reports] with 60 percent of the votes and <a href="http://www.kolotv.com/news/headlines/Private_Property_Rights_105396013.html?ref=013">remains a popular initiative</a> [KOLO report]. Advocates of the measure claimed that, while well-intentioned, PISTOL contained several flaws that wasted taxpayer money on unnecessary lawsuits and interfered with efforts to maintain infrastructure including schools, roads, water supply and sewage systems. Advocates also noted that the changes were supported by government, private businesses, the public and even the original sponsors of PISTOL.  Prominent Las Vegas eminent domain lawyer and PISTOL drafter, Kermitt Waters, indicated that <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/10/crusader-man-people/">all the core elements of PISTOL remain</a> [<em>Las Vegas Sun</em> report]. Critics of the ballot measure claimed it would weaken the protections contained in PISTOL, expanding the government's power to use eminent domain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In return for this, the initiative would have reduced the limit on statewide property taxes by 20 percent and increased the business and occupation tax credit to $4,800. The initiative provided for additional funds to go to education and health services. Opponents of the initiative at <a href = "http://www.defeat1098.com/">Defeat1098.com</a> [advocacy website] were concerned that the income tax would eventually extend to all Washington citizens, not just those in the upper income bracket. Proponents at <a href = "http://www.yeson1098.com/">Yeson1098.com</a> [advocacy website], however, believed the tax would aid small businesses while funneling money toward health and education.

<p>Washington is one of seven states in the US that <a href = "http://dor.wa.gov/content/FindTaxesAndRates/IncomeTax/Default.aspx">does not have a personal income tax</a> [DOR backgrounder], instead raising revenue through sales taxes and business taxes. Voters have rejected any attempts to create personal income tax, through several ballot initiatives. Although a graduated income tax was accepted in 1932, the state supreme court found it unconstitutional in 1933. The court held that income was property and that Article VII, Section 1 of the <a href = "http://www.leg.wa.gov/lawsandagencyrules/pages/constitution.aspx">state constitution</a> [text] precludes the non-uniform taxation of property. Ballot initiatives are not uncommon in Washington, with nine other issues on the ballot this November. Last year, voters <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">expanded domestic partnership rights</a>, and the year before, <a href = "/paperchase/2008/11/washington-supports-lethal.php">physician&#8211;assisted suicides</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was passed by the state <a href="http://www.azhouse.gov/">House of Representatives</a> and placed on the ballot after the <a href="http://www.azsenate.gov/">Senate</a> [official websites] also approved the measure in June 2009. The language on the ballot <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/Info/PubPamphlet/english/Prop107.htm">read</a> [materials]: <blockquote>A "yes" vote shall have the effect of prohibiting the State from giving preferential treatment to or discriminating against any person or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin. The prohibition applies to preferences or discrimination in public employment, education or contracting. It exempts reasonably necessary qualifications based on sex, existing court orders and actions that would result in the loss of federal funds. The State includes state government, local governments, public colleges and universities, community colleges and school districts.</blockquote>The measure was sponsored by state representative <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/MembersPage.asp?Member_ID=41&Legislature=49&Session_ID=93">Steve Montenegro</a> (R) [official website].

<p>In August, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] held that a state affirmative action ban does <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-high-court-rules-affirmative-action-ban-constitutional.php">not violate the federal constitution</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2008, ballot measures banning affirmative action <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ballot-measure-fails.php">failed in Colorado</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ban-passed-in.php">passed in Nebraska</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunionjack.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] announced Wednesday that <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google UK</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] has <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/pressreleases/2010/google_inc_street_view_press_release_03112010.ashx">committed a "significant breach"</a> [press release, ashx] of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] through its data collection practices for its <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Street View maps</a> [website]. During the investigation, authorities found that when Google Street View cars gathered data over WiFi networks they also collected pieces of personal information including e-mails, complete URLs and passwords. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham is requiring Google to delete the data as soon as it is legally possible, saying:<blockquote>It is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the Data Protection Act. The most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from Google that this will not happen again - and to follow this up with an ICO audit.</blockquote>The ICO has <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/library/Corporate/Notices/google_inc_gsv_letter_03112010.ashx">required Google to implement</a> [letter, ashx] company policies and employee training on privacy principles, security awareness and the requirements of the Data Protection Law. The ICO will undertake an audit on Google's collection practices nine months from the implementation of the new privacy policies to ensure that no future data protection breaches occur. The ICO has not imposed any monetary penalties on Google, but will commence enforcement action if Google fails to comply with data protection regulations in the future. The UK <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/">Metropolitan Police</a> [official website] have indicated that they are not pursuing a further investigation after <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-police-launch-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">launching a probe</a> [JURIST report] in June to determine whether Google violated privacy laws while mapping for Street View. The probe was initiated in response to a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/privacy-rights-group-accuses-google-of-criminal-intent.php">complaint filed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy International</a> (PI) [advocacy website], which claimed that the information gathered in an <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//googleblogs/pdfs/friedberg_sourcecode_analysis_060910.pdf">independent audit</a> [text, PDF] published by Google earlier that month proves that company's <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">interception of unencrypted data was not inadvertent</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Several additional investigations have recently been launched into Google's unencrypted data collections to determine whether the Internet giant's practices have violated privacy laws. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into Google's internal policies and procedures that led to the company inadvertently collecting data on unsecured wireless networks. In October, Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart announced that Google was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF] (PIPEDA). In August, the <a href="http://www.police.go.kr/">South Korean National Police Agency</a> (SKNPA) [official website, in Korean] raided the Google South Korean headquarters in Seoul in connection with accusations that the company has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">illegally acquiring user data</a> [JURIST report]. In July, Australian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">completed an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the search giant's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google+privacy">collection and storage of private data</a> [JURIST news archive] over unsecured wireless networks, determining that the company violated the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/law">Australia Privacy Act</a> [government backgrounder]. In June, Connecticut <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?a=2178&Q=295440">Attorney General Richard Blumenthal</a> [official profile] announced that he will <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">lead a multi-state investigation</a> [JURIST report] against Google and requested additional detailed information from the company on its data harvesting procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Proposed <a href="http://www.votesmart.org/election_ballot_measures_detail.php?ballot_id=1560">Amendment 62</a> [Project Vote Smart backgrounder], commonly known as the "Personhood Amendment," would have changed the definition of "person" to include "every human being from the beginning of the biological development." Such a measure would have extended to fetuses inalienable rights, equality of justice and due process of law under the Colorado <a href="http://law.justia.com/colorado/constitution/cnart2.html">Bill of Rights</a> [text] and would have potentially ended legal abortion in the state. Supporters of the amendment argued that, currently, legal rights are not granted until after birth even though the state constitution does not define "person," and they hoped the changes would move Colorado toward the making abortion illegal. However, opponents claimed that the changes would harm individuals' ability to make health care decisions, would possibly inhibit access to birth control methods and would limit stem cell research. Critics also argued that since the proposed amendment did not define the term "beginning of the biological development," the use of such a definition would have forced the courts to decide its meaning in a wide array of legal situations. Supporters of Amendment 62 <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16138621?obref=obinsite">sued</a> [<em>Denver Post</em> report] the <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/lcs">Colorado Legislative Council</a> [official website] in September for including allegedly biased descriptions of the measure in its <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?c=Document_C&childpagename=CGA-LegislativeCouncil%2FDocument_C%2FCLCAddLink&cid=1251580585256&pagename=CLCWrapper">ballot information booklet</a> [text, PDF] that was widely distributed to voters. However, a district court judge <a href="http://www.personhoodcolorado.com/blog/personhood-amendments-lawsuit-over-colorado-blue-book-dismissed">dismissed the case</a> [Personhood CO report] last month, saying that the books had already been circulated when the lawsuit was filed and that it was not feasible for the government to re-collect the books from voters.

<p>While Colorado's "personhood" debate has <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/colorado-high-court-oks-ballot.php">surfaced in ballot initiatives</a> [JURIST report] since 2007, other states have also been addressing abortion law. In August, Nebraska <a href="http://www.ago.state.ne.us/index.htm">Attorney General Jon Bruning</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/nebraska-ag-agrees-to-permanent-injunction-of-state-abortion-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he agreed to a permanent injunction of a Nebraska <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=6605">abortion law</a> [LB 594 materials] because he believed there was little chance that the law would withstand a court challenge. A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the law was <a href="/pdf/ppheartland.pdf">filed</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-sues-over-nebraska-abortion-law-requiring-psychological-screenings.php">report</a>] in June by women's rights group <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/heartland/index.htm">Planned Parenthood of the Heartland</a> [advocacy website], and a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-blocks-enforcement-of-nebraska-abortion-law.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] the same month prohibiting the law from going into effect. Also in June, Florida Governor <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Charlie Crist</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. In May, Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ordered <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en/youtubea-baykal-yasagi-2.html">access to YouTube blocked</a> [<em>Anatolia</em> report, in Turkish] after video of former opposition leader Deniz Baykal in a bedroom with a female aide surfaced on the site. Baykal <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8672672.stm">resigned</a> [BBC report] in May following the exposure of video revealing his affair. The court ordered the Telecommunication Transmission Directorate (TIB), which controls Internet accessibility in Turkey, to direct YouTube to remove the video of Baykal and block access to the site if it failed to comply. On Saturday, the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office of Ankara <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/turkish-government-lifts-youtube-ban.php">lifted the nearly three-year ban</a> [JURIST report] on YouTube after videos allegedly insulting Turkey's founder <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [<em>Turkish News</em> profile] were removed from the site's content. Insulting Ataturk is a criminal offense in Turkey, punishable by prison sentence. After confirming with the police department that the disputed content had been taken down, the prosecutor's office ordered the TIB to enable YouTube for Turkish Internet users. 

<p>Turkey's ban on YouTube was originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/turkish-court-reimposes-youtube-ban-for.php">implemented</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 after insulting clips of Ataturk were discovered on the site. Earlier this year, the TIB also placed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-government-restricts-google-services.php">ban on certain Google sites</a> [JURIST report], which made it difficult for Turkish citizens to access YouTube indirectly. Turkish President Abdullah Gul <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-president-criticizes-ban-on-google-services.php">criticized these bans</a> [JURIST report] on his Twitter account and called for them to be lifted. The OSCE has repeated called on Turkey to bring its penal code in line with OSCE commitments and international standards. Specifically, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=ENGEUR440352005">Article 301</a> [AI Backgrounder] of the Turkish penal code, which criminalizes insulting "Turkishness," has been criticized for too-strictly limiting free speech, a limitation that is seen as a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eu-report-on-turkey-accession-cites.php">stumbling block</a> [JURIST report] for Turkey's admittance to the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the actions committed by the convicted men constituted organized crime, which targeted Pukanic for his extensive reporting on the topic in Croatia. Pukanic was the the founder and editor-in-chief of Croatian political weekly <a href="http://www.nacional.hr/en/">Nacional</a> [official website]. He was a controversial figure in Croatia and was <a href="http://ph.news.yahoo.com/afp/20101103/twl-croatia-serbia-media-crime-justice-4bdc673.html">known for his close ties</a> [AFP report] with both high-ranking Croatian officials and top criminal figures. Pukanic's death was the first of its kind since the country's independence in 1991 and caused the government to reinforce its campaign against corruption. The six men face individual sentences of 15 to 40 years, with an aggregate sentencing of more than 150 years. 

<p>Croatian officials have been under serious pressure to the tackle the issue of corruption in order to gain <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/croatia/index_en.htm">accession</a> [EU materials] to the EU by 2012. The prosecution of individuals for organized crime and war crimes has been one of the major issues faced by Croatia in its accession process. In 2008 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area. The entry talks were resumed in October of that year after the ICTY declared that Croatia was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/icty-says-croatia-now-cooperating-on.php">fully cooperating</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Military leaders of the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD), who have held power after staging a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-president-held-hostage-in.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] in February to oust then-president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1054396.stm#leaders">Mamadou Tandja</a> [BBC profile], assert that the new constitution is pivotal in returning the country back to civilian rule. The CSRD <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-military-leaders-suspend.php">suspended</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">previous constitution</a> [JURIST reports], which allowed Tandja to remain in office for three more years and to run in any subsequent elections in fear that it expanded executive power beyond necessary limits. The new constitution will limit the power of the president to serve no more than two five-year terms and will also grant immunity to the military leaders who staged the coup. Opponents of the new constitution fear that less executive power will make it difficult to rule Niger in light of its grave poverty levels and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8751000/8751252.stm">chronic hunger crisis</a> [BBC report]. However, supporters say the approval of the referendum helps to maintain Niger's timeline for presidential and parliamentary elections to be held in January and a complete handover of power from the military junta to the president in April. 

<p>The constitution will be the seventh since Niger's independence from France in 1960. In September 2009, members of Nigerien opposition parties said that police had detained 30 former opposition lawmakers allegedly at the behest of Tandja. The 30 former members of parliament were arrested on <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/niger-opposition-lawmakers-arrested-for.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report], but were likely being targeted for their dissidence, as they refused to recognize Tandja's expansion of powers. Earlier this year, Nigerien rights group, the United Front for the Safeguard of Democratic Assets (Fusad), <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-rights-group-urges-prosecution-of.php">pushed for the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of Tandja on treason charges and corruption violating the constitution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Winn</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-five-cases.php">report</a>] on the constitutionality of an Arizona tax credit for donations to organizations that provide scholarships at private schools, which allows scholarships funded by religious organizations to be granted only to students attending parochial schools. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/04/21/0515754.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the taxpayers had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law and allowed the claim to proceed. The outcome will determine if tax credit program unconstitutionally endorses or advances religion simply because taxpayers choose to direct more contributions to religious organization than nonreligious ones. Counsel for the petitioners argued that, "Arizona's tuition tax credit does not violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral law that results in scholarship programs of private choice." Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> in support of petitioners. Counsel for the respondents clarified their argument: "Our claim is not that ... State money is going to religious schools. Our claim is that State money is being given to the beneficiaries of a State spending program on the basis of religion. It's a claim about discrimination in the distribution of these stated funds."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1314.pdf">Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00030103----000-.html">federal minimum safety standard</a> [text], which authorizes automobile manufacturers to install a lap-only seat belt at the inboard seating positions of a vehicle, preempts a state tort action alleging that the manufacturer should have installed a lap and shoulder belt in one of those seating positions. A California state appeals court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/08-1314_lower_op.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that a state action was preempted by <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/fmvss/index.html#SN208">Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208</a> [text], which requires lap and shoulder seat belt assemblies only for outboard seating. Petitioners claim that <a href="http://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a> [corporate website] had a duty to warn of safety risks associated with lap-only seat belts under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/06-1249P.ZS">Wyeth v. Levine</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-rules-state-law-not.php">report</a>], in which the Supreme Court ruled that federal approval of labels giving warnings about effects of drugs does not bar lawsuits under state law claiming inadequate warnings of a health risk. Counsel for the petitioners argued, "[t]he claim is not preempted, because it is perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208 governing Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats." Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of petitioners. Counsel for respondents argued that the claim should be preempted because the federal government did not merely provide a minimum standard but left the option to the manufacturer because of safety trade-offs for each type of seatbelt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, an appeals court in Paris <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkVtuh2hfpk2arhXTa_9JIUCTbRQ?docId=CNG.f8d6dcdf2470cc008581e945560bb3e1.8d1">rejected a request</a> [AFP report] from the accused for his release and, according to an ICC spokesperson, unless Mbarushimana's lawyers appeal the extradition order, he will be handed over to the court within a month. The French court authorized the transfer to the ICC on the condition that Mbarushimana not be taken back to Rwanda, a provision largely imposed due to fears that he would not receive a fair trial there.

<p>Last month, UN peacekeepers and DRC forces <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-forces-arrest-rebel-leader-for-drc-mass-rapes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] rebel group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/mayi-mayi.htm">Mai Mai Cheka</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader Lieutenant Colonel Sadoke Kokunda Mayele for allegedly leading <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drc+mass+rape">mass rapes</a> [JURIST news archive], along with the FDLR and other rebel groups, in the DRC in late July and early August. Also last month, the UN released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/DRC_MAPPING_REPORT_FINAL_EN.pdf">report on war crimes</a> [text, PDF; JURIST report] and human rights abuses in the DRC. The report, originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-delays-release-of-controversial-drc-genocide-report.php">expected to be released in September</a> [JURIST report], lists 617 of the most serious violations of human rights, including violence against children, genocide and mass rape, committed between 1993 and 2003.

The settlement is in response to a <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] filed in July alleging that the Buzz application within Gmail exposed private user data, including contact lists, to other Gmail users. Under the settlement, Google will place $8.5 million dollars into a common fund to distribute to organizations that provide education regarding Internet privacy. Google sent out a <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/notice.pdf">notice</a> [text, PDF] to all of its Gmail users notifying them of the terms of the settlement and stressing that the settlement does not provide for payment of damages to individual users. The notice advised users that they could opt-out of the settlement by December 6 to pursue further litigation or choose to be included and forfeit that right. The <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] will hold a fairness hearing regarding the settlement on January 31, and users also have the option to contact the court with objections or ask to speak at the hearing. Class members include any Gmail users who were given the opportunity to use Buzz before November 2. Google stressed that the settlement did not mean that the company was admitting liability for the privacy breach and that the company has since resolved all privacy issues with the Buzz application.

<p>Google has also recently come under investigation for privacy breaches relating to its Street View program. On Wednesday, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/"> Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] announced that the company <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">committed a "significant breach"</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] when Street View vehicles inadvertently collected personal information over WiFi networks including passwords, e-mails and URLs. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's internal policies and procedures that led to the breach. Last month, <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.cfm">Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart</a> [official website] announced that the Street View breach <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF]. In July, Australian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Google's collection and storage of private data, concluding that the company violated the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/law">Australia Privacy Act</a> [government backgrounder]. In August, the <a href="http://www.police.go.kr/">South Korean National Police Agency</a> (SKNPA) [official website, in Korean<a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">] raided the Google South Korean headquarters</a> [JURIST report] after accusing Google of illegally acquiring user data. Spain also announced in August that it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">launching an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into potential violations of the country's privacy law.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tadic and Croatian <a href="http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=2194">President Ivo Josipovic</a> [official website, in Croatian] together visited a memorial in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm">Vukovar</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vukovar">news archive</a>], where Serbian forces murdered 260 Croatians in November 1991. Tadic said, "I came here to offer an apology and express regret." Tadic becomes the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11689153">first Serbian president to visit the site</a> [BBC report], as the two countries continue to try to find ways to improve relations. Josipovic and Tadic plan to later visit the site where 18 Serbian villagers were killed by Croatians. Opposition in both countries criticized the visit, calling it nothing more than a political stunt and meaningless. 

<p>The challenge of improving the relationship between Serbia and Croatia remains difficult, even as leaders in both countries seem committed to the effort. In August, Croatian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/croatia-extradites-convicted-djindjic-assassin-to-serbia.php">extradited</a> Sretko Kalinic to Serbia for his connection with the <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/breaking-news-serbian-prime-minister.php">2003 assassination</a> [JURIST reports] of former Serbian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2844081.stm">Zoran Djindjic</a> [BBC obituary; <a href="http://www.zorandjindjic.org/">memorial website</a>, in Serbian]. However, the continuing attempt to find all individuals responsible for the atrocities has created a <a href="/hotline/2010/01/serbias-genocide-suit-against-croatia.php">new political tension</a> [JURIST comment] in the region that will not soon go away. In January, the Serbian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/serbia-files-genocide-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Croatia in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], accusing the Croatian government of committing genocide during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+war">1991-1995 Balkan War</a> [JURIST news archive]. The suit was in response to a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=cry&case=118&k=73">similar suit</a> [case materials] filed by Croatia against Serbia in 1999. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The recommendations come after a <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/11/eu_pushes_for_stronger_interne.html">review of its 15 year-old privacy laws</a> [WP report]. The document addresses issues including "improving the coherence of the data protection legal framework," "enhancing control over one's own data" and "ensuring informed and free consent." If followed, the proposed measures could make it easier for people to delete information about themselves on the Internet and increase enforcement for websites that breach their users' privacy. The writers also argued for why the new measures are necessary:<blockquote>Like technology, the way our personal data is used and shared in our society is changing all the time. The challenge this poses to legislators is to establish a legislative framework that will stand the test of time. At the end of the reform process, Europe's data protection rules should continue to guarantee a high level of protection and provide legal certainty to individuals, public administrations and businesses in the internal market alike for several generations. No matter how complex the situation or how sophisticated the technology, clarity must exist on the applicable rules and standards that national authorities have to enforce and that businesses and technology developers must comply with. Individuals should also have clarity about the rights they enjoy.
</blockquote> Next year, the Commission will propose legislation aimed at revising the legal framework for data protection, the report says.

<p>In September, the Commission announced that it would refer the UK to the European Court of Justice for <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/eu-suing-uk-over-internet-privacy.php">not fully complying with EU regulations</a> [JURIST report] that protect the privacy of electronic communications. The EU has found UK law in breach of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:NOT">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC</a> and the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:NOT">Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC</a> [texts], regulations regarding consent to interception and the role of enforcement and supervisory committees. Specifically, current UK law does not provide for an independent national authority to supervise the interception of some communications, it allows for communications to be received without fulfilling the EU definition of consent and it does not have a mechanism that ensures sanctions for unlawful unintentional interception, as required by EU law. The EC formally <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/european-commission-starts-infringement.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] the UK in April 2009 that it was starting infringement proceedings for failure to follow EU Internet privacy and data protection rules.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A deputy attorney general said that the office has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/03/AR2010110307732.html">received complaints</a> [WP report] that election officials working for the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website], which is responsible for investigating complaints of voter fraud in the country, allegedly tampered with voting results. The AG's office expressed concern that the IEC did not provide sufficient reason for last month's invalidation of 1.3 million votes, constituting nearly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iugtVKtMAkUtJkYhCeF6gmksC4Uw?docId=CNG.eedb0f66e03b42c4cacdaf19b591ff66.221">one-fourth of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide</a> [AP report]. The ballots were <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">thrown out</a> [JURIST report] due to alleged findings by the IEC that the 2,543 polling stations involved did not follow IEC procedures. The new investigation may also involve a second Afghan election monitoring organization, the <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website], which is also responsible for <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/images/stories/pdf/33%20media%20release%20281010.pdf">invalidating ballots</a>  [media release, PDF] and disqualifying political candidates. IEC officials argue that the AG's office does <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/articledoes /ALeqM5gST5N75hEnyTULaDxhzCqP66C39A?docId=5031904">not have authority to investigate voting fraud</a> [CP report], but the AG's office emphasized their responsibility to investigate crime and eliminate corruption.

<p>The election was held in September after being <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8477368.stm">postponed by four months</a> [BBC report] due to logistical and security concerns and was contested by 2,500 candidates competing for the 249 seats in the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the Afghan parliament. Following the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive], the ECC <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/afghanistan-runoff-set-after-un-backed.php">invalidated results from 210 polling stations</a> [JURIST report]. The ECC found clear and convincing evidence of fraud and also ordered the IEC to invalidate a percentage of votes from both candidates. In April, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/afghanistan-president-accuses-un-eu.php">blamed foreign officials for the extensive irregularities</a> [JURIST report] that occurred during the presidential election. Though admitting that fraud was widespread, Karzai accused UN and EU representatives of attempting to influence vote counts. In November 2009, Karzai was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/karzai-declared-winner-of-afghanistan.php">declared the winner of the election</a> [JURIST report] after challenger <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1672882.stm">Abdullah Abdullah</a> [BBC profile] withdrew from the runoff election due to his belief that a free and fair vote was impossible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US District Judge Martin Feldman said that the claims filed by drilling companies against US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] are <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-03/judge-tosses-challenge-to-u-s-gulf-deep-water-drilling-ban-as-irrelevant.html">no longer relevant</a> [Bloomberg report] because both moratoriums have been lifted. Salazar <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/doi-lifts-deepwater-drilling-moratorium-ahead-of-schedule.php">announced in October</a> [JURIST report] that the six-month moratorium on certain types of deepwater oil drilling would <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Salazar-Deepwater-Drilling-May-Resume-for-Operators-Who-Clear-Higher-Bar-for-Safety-Environmental-Protection.cfm">come to an end</a> [press release] some seven weeks ahead of schedule. In announcing the lifting of the moratorium, Salazar said that <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-government-introduces-new-offshore-drilling-regulations.php">new drilling regulations enacted in October</a> [JURIST report] and industry safety strategies developed in the wake of the oil spill have reduced the likelihood of future incidents such that the ban was no longer needed. Feldman did not rule on additional claims filed by against the government, which allege that federal regulators have delayed the granting of permits under the new regulations and that new regulations requiring permits exceed the authority of the administrators. The government has indicated that permits will be granted when drilling companies <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/offshore-drilling-ban-lawsuit-dismissed/?partner=rss&emc=rss">comply with the stated standards</a> [NYT report]. The court is scheduled to address the remaining claims later this month. 

<p>In September, Feldman <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/GENERAL/Notices/10-1663_doc165.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rules-against-drilling-moratorium.php">report</a>] the government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by <a href="http://www.hornbeckoffshore.com/">Hornbeck Offshore Services</a> [corporate website] and several other drilling companies challenging the government's most recent moratorium on offshore drilling. The second moratorium directive was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-issues-new-drilling-moratorium.php">issued in July</a> [JURIST report] by Salazar after the district court and the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">granted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the government's initial directive. Earlier in July, the Obama administration asked a federal appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">reinstate the original six-month drilling moratorium</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the ban should be upheld because the government would likely win its appeal of the lower court's ruling. In June, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] asked the court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">stay the preliminary injunction of the original moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the basis that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. Lawyers for the DOJ also claimed that that the district judge abused his discretion in issuing the injunction. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was a result of an oil well blowout that caused an explosion 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf. More than 120 million gallons of oil leaked from the rig's broken pipe causing the spill to surpass the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez</a>  [JURIST news archive] as the worst oil spill in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The October 21 indictment charges Mohamud Abdi Yusuf, Duane Mohamed Diriye and Abdi Mahdi Hussein with funding and providing materials to a known terrorist organization. The federal grand jury charged Yusuf and Hussein with allegedly transferring funds through a Minneapolis wire-transfer business where Hussein was employed to al Shabaab supporters in Somalia from 2008 to July 2009. The indictment details the care the men took to avoid detection, often breaking up transfers into smaller amounts and using code words. Diriye, who is believed to be in Kenya or Somalia, was charged with collecting the funds for al Shabaab. The indictment also mentions unspecified individuals who were allegedly complicit in the conspiracy to provide funding to the organization. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/03/AR2010110305153.html">Federal agents arrested</a> [AP Report] Yusuf on Monday in St. Louis and Hussein on Tuesday in Minneapolis. Both men appeared in court on Tuesday. Hussein has since been released on bond. The indictments were unsealed the day after three other men were <a href="http://jnslp.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/moalin.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] in San Diego with providing support to al Shabaab.

<p>The government has increasingly targeted financial transactions in an effort to dry up funding for terrorist organizations. In September, a New York man was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/new-york-man-charged-with-funding-attempted-times-square-bombing.php">charged with providing funds</a> [JURIST report] to a man who attempted in May to detonate a car bomb in Times Square. The indictment alleges that Mohammad Younis unknowingly transferred funds to individuals, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8659766.stm">Faisal Shahzad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=faisal+shahzad">news archive</a>], through hawala, a "value transfer system in which money does not physically cross international boundaries through the banking system." In August, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that 14 individuals had been charged with <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/doj-charges-14-with-aiding-somalia-based-terror-organization-al-shabaab.php">providing money and funding to al Shabaab</a> [JURIST report]. In April 2009, an Afghan man was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-prosecutors-charge-afghan-with.php">charged financing terrorist activity</a> [JURIST report]. Haji Juma Khan, who was already detained on charges of narco-terrorism, was accused of providing the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive] with proceeds from his drug operation with knowledge that the money would be used in terrorist activities in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cameron suggested that the law may be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11695416">reformed</a> [BBC report] in order to allow for increased use of copyright material without the owner's permission. The review is set to take place over six months and will examine the interaction between intellectual property and competition law, how to remove barriers for small businesses, and how to help small businesses protect and exploit their intellectual property, and it will take into account more relaxed US rules on copyright material, including rules on the use of copyright material without the owner's permission. In April, the review will issue a report recommending changes to UK law and suggesting long-term goals for the government. The announcement, seen as an attempt to restore balance after the controversial <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/47?view=plain">Digital Economy Bill</a> [text], has been cheered by Internet freedom campaigners and small businesses alike. However, reforms may be resisted by the music and film industries.

<p>In April, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/uk-parliament-passes-anti-piracy-law.php">approved the Digital Economy Bill</a> [JURIST report], authorizing the suspension of Internet service for those who repeatedly download copyrighted material illegally. The act also received <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100408-0013.htm#10040856001075">Royal Assent</a> [text] and is now law. The new law calls on Internet service providers (ISPs) to block download sites, reduce a user's broadband speeds and ultimately shut down a user's Internet access in order to prevent piracy of copyrighted materials. The bill, known as a three-strikes law, imposes stricter penalties on repeat digital offenders than had previously existed, and has received a great deal of public criticism. Certain ISPs have even threatened not to comply with the law, but MPs who support it say it is a necessary step to protect the creators of digital content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The postponement allows Karadzic to read 14,000 pages of evidence the prosecution sent to him in October. Karadzic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 war crimes charges</a>, including counts of genocide and murder, for alleged crimes he committed during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Karadzic is defending himself in court and has denied all of the charges against him. The court's decision to delay the trial is partially because of the prosecution's repeated violations of its obligation to disclose evidence to the accused. The ICTY's press release states:<blockquote>Having already admonished the Prosecution in those previous decisions to better organise and give greater priority to its disclosure processes, Judge Kwon stated that the Chamber was increasingly troubled by the potential cumulative effect of late disclosure on the overall fairness of the trial.</blockquote>The trial's suspension will take affect after the witnesses already at The Hague or in transit have the chance to testify in court.

<p>In September, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/karadzic-takes-stand-as-war-crimes-trial-resumes.php">trial resumed</a> [JURIST report] as Karadzic defended himself before the ICTY after repeated attempts to delay proceedings. The trial previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/karadzic-war-crimes-trial-resumes-with.php">resumed in April</a> [JURIST report], after the ICTY <a href="/pdf/KaradzicDecisionOnMotionToStay.pdf">denied</a> [judgment PDF, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/karadzic-fails-in-latest-bid-to-delay.php">report</a>] Karadzic's <a href="/pdf/KaradzicMotionToStay.pdf">attempt</a> [motion, PDF] to delay court proceedings, in which he argued a violation of his right to a fair hearing due to the court's rejection of evidentiary challenges. In March, Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/icty-denies-karadzic-appeal-to-delay.php">lost another motion</a> to postpone his war crimes trial for charges committed during the Bosnia conflict. Following repeated delays in the proceedings, the ICTY judges warned in September that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icty-judges-warn-karadzic-trial-likely-to-continue-until-2014.php">trial might continue until 2014</a> [JURIST report], which is two years longer than expected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Colom has stated that his government does not believe capital punishment improves a nation's security and has called on the <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/main.asp">Guatemalan Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] to <a href="http://www.dca.gob.gt/nacional_principal.html">abolish</a> [DCA report, in Spanish] capital punishment permanently.

Some legislators, unhappy with the veto, have said they will try to establish a super-majority to override the decision. In 2002, then-president Alfonso Portillo directed the <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] to suspend the death penalty in Guatemala. The Constitutional Court granted the moratorium, stating that it was Congress' job to amend the law. A number of Guatemala prisoners on death row have been in limbo since the imposition of the moratorium. 

<p>In 2008, Colom <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guatemala-president-vetoes-death.php">vetoed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report]] that would have restored the country's death penalty. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR34/004/2008/en/8ceb55c2-e55b-11dc-afe6-8ba00186412f/amr340042008eng.html">Decree 06-2008</a> [AI backgrounder] would also have given Colom the power to decide whether to grant clemency and commute the sentences of the 34 inmates currently on death row to 50 years in prison, or to order their executions to take place. In vetoing the measure Colom said cases in the US showed that the death penalty did not deter crime and that strengthening security institutions was the best way to fight crime in Guatemala. Last month, protesters across the globe <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/international-protests-urge-abolishment-of-the-death-penalty.php">marked the 8th World Day against the Death Penalty</a> [JURIST report], specifically urging the US, Iran and China to end the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-115.htm">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [docket; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>], the court will determine whether the <a href="http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">Legal Arizona Workers Act</a> (LAWA) [materials] is preempted by federal law. Koster contends that the statute is valid under the <a href="http://www.oig.lsc.gov/legis/irca86.htm">Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986</a> [text], which authorizes states to license businesses and penalize those that violate hiring regulations. A decision invalidating the policy would significantly impede states' abilities to enforce their business and immigration laws, according to Koster. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for next month.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/09-115_ca9.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/ninth-circuit-rejects-challenge-to.php">report</a>] the statute in 2008 on the basis that it is a licensing law, which exempts it from being preempted by federal law. The court also concluded that the LAWA reflects the "rising frustration with the United States Congress's failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform," and did not overstep the state's authority to regulate immigration. Earlier this week, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-immigration-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on Arizona's more recent controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. The state's representatives argued that Arizona is on the front line of human and drug trafficking from Mexico, and the law is meant to assist with the enforcement and implementation of federal immigration law when the federal government is either "unable or unwilling to solve the problem. The federal government cautioned that allowing states to create immigration policy could create a patchwork system and potentially harm foreign relations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law would prevent Oklahoma courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures," requiring them only to look to legal precedents of other states for guidance, provided that state does not use Islamic law.

The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] opposes a public inquiry, arguing in a <a href="http://www.blogs.mod.uk/defence_news/2010/11/defence-in-the-media-5-november-2010.html">blog post</a> [text] that a public inquiry would be too expensive and less effective than the MOD investigation, especially since the MOD has already assembled a team to investigate the claims.

The hearings will resume Monday and are expected to end the following day.

<p>In September, an MOD report found that the UK's treatment of detainees <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/uk-defense-ministry-report-finds-little-wrong-with-detainee-treatment.php">complies with domestic and international law</a> [JURIST report]. In July, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">create a panel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate claims that British government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas. The investigation stems from a civil action, brought by 12 ex-detainees who allege that British agents participated in their abuse while they were held in prisons in Pakistan, Morocco and other countries. The UK will ask them to drop their lawsuits in exchange for possible compensation and a promise that the impending inquiry will fully investigate their claims. In June, the UK government indicated that it will issue a new set of regulations regarding the use of information <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">obtained via torture</a> [JURIST report] as claims of complicity in torture were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">report</a> [materials] released the same day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first was <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=75&mnid=1">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [case materials], a former Rwandan pastor who <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/former-rwanda-pastor-pleads-not-guilty-to-genocide-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity relating to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>]. The second application was for <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=65&mnid=12">Fulgence Kayishema</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/ictr-seeks-return-of-genocide-case-to.php">report</a>], who was a police inspector during the war and has been charged with conspiring to exterminate Tutsis during the Hutu-led uprising, which left around 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus dead. The last application was for <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=74&mnid=12">Charles Sikubwabo</a> [case materials], former Bourgmestre of Gishyita, Kibuye Prefecture. Sikubwabo is facing similar charges as Kayishema. Jallow filed applications for the referral of these cases to Rwanda for trial in 2007, but the applications failed because the trial chambers were worried that the defendants would not receive fair trials as a result of some of the laws at the time.

<p>Last month, representatives from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the ICTR appeared before the UN General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-war-crimes-tribunals-ask-general-assembly-for-more-resources.php">request additional financial resources</a> [JURIST report] and institutional support on behalf of the various war crimes tribunals. In June, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] the cases of 25 suspects to Rwandan authorities. The suspects, who have been investigated but not yet indicted by the ICTR, are believed to be in hiding abroad. The transfers are a part of the strategy intended to <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/English/FactSheets/Completion_St/S-2009-587e.pdf">finish</a> [completion strategy text, PDF] the court's trial work by 2011. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga told the UN Security Council last year that the decisions by the ICTR not to transfer pending cases to Rwandan jurisdiction, including genocide suspects <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=2&mnid=2">Jean-Baptiste Gatete</a> and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=6&mnid=2">Yussuf Munyakazi</a> [case materials] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rwanda-prosecutor-criticizes-ictr.php">undermines judicial reforms</a> [JURIST report] and hinders national reconciliation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The accused <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g5c_6Wft6cw4zajy1QbBNXBx2mXQ?docId=CNG.89c96e59c479e63644d023208c721a83.b21">denied involvement</a> [AFP report] in the 2009 attack on the ship the MV Amira. Their lawyer, Jared Magolo, said that the magistrate <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=387&sid=1645156">ruled that the prosecution had insufficient evidence</a> [AP report] and that the magistrate believed that the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/swf/index.asp">US Navy</a> [official website] had failed to turn over evidence that may have convicted his clients. According to Magolo, it is not clear what will happen to the men now, as repatriating them to Somalia, which is currently in a state of war, would violate international law.

<p>Earlier this week, a Yemeni court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">sentenced 10 Somali Pirates</a> [JURIST report] to five years in prison for attacking Yemeni fishing boats. The international community has been supporting actions taken against maritime piracy, but the UN has recently had to call for nations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-urges-nations-to-assist-kenya-in-conducting-piracy-trials.php">assist Kenya in conducting piracy trials</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would spend more than USD $9.3 million to fund courts that prosecute suspected Somali pirates. This action came in response to the Kenyan government's announcement in April that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer accept</a> [JURIST report] Somali pirate cases due to its overburdened legal system. The month of April also saw the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-security-council-urges-international.php">approve a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling on member states to criminalize piracy under their domestic laws as well as an announcement from the UN that a trust fund established to combat piracy will be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34472&Cr=somali&Cr1=">funding five projects</a> [UN News Centre report] in an effort to help Somalia and its neighbors reduce acts of piracy committed in nearby bodies of water.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] had asked the court to decide whether <a href="http://www.fremontne.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=714">Fremont Ordinance 5156</a> [text], which mandates that renters obtain a permit from the city in order to acquire housing and which prohibits individuals from renting or leasing housing to individuals they know or should know are in the US illegally, violates state law. The court declined to act, saying that there is no need to decide this question because:<blockquote>the U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal courts are not required to obtain a state court's construction of a state statute or ordinance before deciding a federal constitutional challenge to the law and should not certify such question unless the law is fairly susceptible to a narrowing construction. Also, the Court has held that it is "manifestly inappropriate to certify a question in a case where ... there is no uncertain question of state law whose resolution might affect the pending federal claim."</blockquote>The city of Fremont has suspended enactment of the ordinance until the district court decides the issue, and the city has <a href="http://fremontne.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=104">raised its property taxes</a> [press release] to fund the court fight.

<p>In September, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073531p.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court's ruling that a similar law passed by the town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, was <a href="=/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report]. Immigration issues have come to the fore in the US since the passage of Arizona's controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this week, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-immigration-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the law's constitutionality. The law was passed because of concerns that federal officials were not taking the issue seriously, but the US Department of Homeland Security announced recently that the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-announces-record-number-of-deportations-in-2010.php">deported a record number of illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST report] in 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order vacated US District Court Judge James Robertson's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/guantanamo-habeas-rulings-made-public.php">decision to release</a> [JURIST report] Slahi and remanded the case, instructing the court to conduct further review to see if Slahi has abandoned ties to the al Qaeda terrorist group to which he swore an oath of allegiance in the early 1990s. The government argues that Slahi can be detained under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF] because he was "part of" al Qaeda when he was captured. The issue was whether, by swearing an oath of allegiance, he was sufficiently part of al Qaeda to allow further detention under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZS.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a> [opinion, text]. The circuit court ruled that the record was insufficient to make a determination as to whether the US government has met its burden of proof to show that Slahi was a "part of" al Qaeda. Slahi has neither been criminally charged for providing material support to a terrorist organization nor for any connection to the 9/11 attacks.

<p>The circuit court heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/dc-circuit-hears-arguments-in-guantanamo-detainee-release-appeal.php">oral arguments </a> [JURIST report] on the case in September after the district court had originally ordered Slahi's release in March. The 9/11 commission report said that Slahi was <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2010/11/05/12/slahioverturnedTransportRoom.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">connected to the 9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report], and he was once considered a key al Qaeda leader with prosecutors seeking the death penalty against him. A prominent government prosecutor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/536/guantanamo-justice.html">stepped down from the case</a> [PBS interview] because he did not support the alleged abusive treatment used against Slahi, which was investigated in a 2008 <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/report-by-the-senate-armed-services-committee-on-detainee-treatment#document/p139">report</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Berenson has served three-quarters of a 20-year sentence, making her <a href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/afp/20101105/twl-peru-us-justice-politics-7e07afd.html">eligible for parole</a> [AFP report]. She must now remain in Peru until the end of her parole, though the government may elect to commute the remainder of her sentence and deport her. Berenson was arrested in 1995 for involvement with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/tupac_amaru.htm">Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement</a> (MRTA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a left-wing rebel group. She is alleged to have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/26/peru-frees-american-lori-berenson">trained guerrillas</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and moved weapons for the MRTA in addition to assisting the group carry out an attack on the Peruvian <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.pe/">Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] by gaining access to the body using press credentials.

<p>Berenson was originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/peru-judge-orders-release-of-us-woman-held-for-involvement-with-rebel-group.php">granted parole</a> [JURIST report] in May with the judge citing her good behavior, renunciation of violence and completion of rehabilitation. Judges for the court restored her sentence in August, however, after legal authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/peru-judge-revokes-parole-of-us-woman-held-for-involvement-with-rebel-group.php">failed to verify addresses of residence</a> [JURIST report] provided by Berenson after her release. In 2005, the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/topics/human_rights.asp">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/inter-american-rights-court-denies-us.php">denied an appeal</a> to reinterpret its November 2004 <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/oas-human-rights-court-upholds.php">ruling that upheld</a> [JURIST reports] Berenson's conviction. Lawyers for Berenson claimed that her trial failed to meet international standards for fairness and sought to have her conviction and sentence overturned. In a 2000 CBS News <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/18/48hours/main242175.shtml">interview</a> [text], Berenson characterized her original trial proceedings as hostile and coercive, saying that she had faced a panel of hooded judges and that armed guards had aimed assault rifles at her and her lawyer's heads during the 10-minute proceeding. She was initially sentenced to life imprisonment by a military court, but the sentence was reduced to 20 years in a civil retrial in 2001.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The LCR are seeking to overturn the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">indefinite extension</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-temporarily-blocks-suspension-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] earlier this week for the duration of the appeals process, or alternately to temporarily block the military from discharging those in violation of the policy. The group argues that the earlier order is premised on an abuse of discretion that failed to properly consider <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> [opinion text]. They also contend that the court inaccurately balanced the competing interests involved, saying that "[a]ny alleged harms to the government are entirely bureaucratic, procedural, and transitory in nature, and are sharply outweighed by the substantial constitutional injury that servicemembers will sustain from a stay of the district court's judgment."  The Ninth Circuit is not expected to issue a final ruling in the matter until next year.

<p>Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy. In September, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that a US Air Force officer be reinstated after being previously discharged under DADT. Also in September, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">rejected a cloture motion</a> [JURIST report] on a defense appropriations bill that would have repealed the policy. In May, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">voted to repeal the policy</a> after President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">agreed to a compromise</a> [JURIST reports] that would prevent the repeal from taking effect until the completion of a review to determine what effects the repeal would have on military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Chen and his wife were accused [<em>Taiwan News</em> report] of <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">taking bribes from banks and financial institutions</a> [JURIST report] that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program.

<p>Chen was found guilty on corruption charges and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009.

Chen was initially detained in November 2008, and was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">formally indicted</a> [JURIST report] a month later. In January 2009, he <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention, after staging three hunger strikes in protest.

Davis was seeking a COA to appeal the <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] September <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/pdf/409cv00130_92part1.pdf">decision</a> [order part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/pdf/409cv00130_92part2.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-court-denies-habeas-petition-in-davis-death-penalty-case.php">report</a>] refusing his <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. In August 2009, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/court-order-Davis.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/supreme-court-orders-low-court-to.php">report</a>] the district court to review Davis' case. He had filed an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/davis-habeas-5-19-09.pdf">original writ of <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [cert. petition, PDF] directly in the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Friday, the federal appellate court noted that "[p]ursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002253----000-.html">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)</a> [Cornell LII materials], a habeas petitioner may not appeal from a district court's adverse ruling unless a circuit justice or judge issues a COA." In addition, the court said:<blockquote>If this court granted Davis's request for a COA and reviewed the district court's order at this juncture, as Davis requests, we would effectively be restoring his remedies in federal court, in complete contradiction to the express intent of Congress. In effect, we would be nullifying our previous decision denying Davis leave to file a successive habeas petition. We decline to do that.</blockquote> In footnote 1 of the district court's September decision, the court called the jurisdictional effects of its decision "unclear," but said Davis would likely have to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court. 

<p>In October 2008, the Eleventh Circuit granted Davis a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/eleventh-circuit-grants-new-stay-of.php">provisional stay of execution</a> [JURIST report], directing the parties to address through briefs whether Davis can meet the stringent requirements of federal law that would permit him to file a second <em>habeas corpus</em> petition for federal review of his case. The Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-rejects-davis-death.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Davis' petition for <em>certiorari</em> appealing his death sentence earlier that month, lifting their own stay on his execution. The court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-supreme-court-stays-execution-of.php">previously stayed</a> [JURIST report] Davis' execution and had also previously denied a petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the case. Davis has been on death row since 1991 for allegedly <a href="http://savannahnow.com/news/2010-11-06/federal-court-denies-troy-davis-appeal">murdering</a> [<em>Savannah Morning News</em> report] an off-duty Savannah, Georgia, police officer in 1989.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In May, the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">voted to repeal the policy</a>, but the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">legislation stalled in the Senate</a> [JURIST reports], leaving the policy in place. The repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy has been an important issue for President Barack Obama since taking office, and its inclusion in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">State of Union Address</a> [JURIST report] reaffirmed it as a top priority for the administration. Also Sunday, Gates called for the Senate to ratify the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf">New START treaty</a> [materials, PDF; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8605857.stm">backgrounder</a>], which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed in April</a> [JURIST report] by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The treaty was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-senate-committee-approves-russia-nuclear-arms-reduction-treaty.php">approved in September</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate. 

<p>Since the enactment of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy. In addition to political attempts at ending the ban on gays in the military, it has faced legal challenges regarding its constitutionality. The <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-asks-supreme-court-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">filed a petition</a> asking the US Supreme Court to rescind the stay <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued</a> [JURIST reports] by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowing the policy to continue being enforced. In September, the US District Court for the Central District of California <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">found the policy an unconstitutional violation</a> of gay service members' First Amendment and due process rights and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued the initial injunction</a> [JURIST reports] against its enforcement the following month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chen Shui-bian and his wife were accused of taking more than $20 million in bribes from banks and financial institutions that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program.

The three judges are accused of accepting more than NT $5 million (USD $155,000) from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ho+Chi">former legislator Ho Chi-Hui</a> [JURIST news archive] in exchange for clearing him of charges related to a corrupt land-development project in May. According to the indictment, prosecutors will be seeking four-year prison term and a fine of NT $1.5 million (USD $50,000) for senior High Court judge Tsai Kuang-chih, an 18-year prison term and a NT $1.5 million fine for judge Chen Jung-ho and 11 years and a NT $2 million ($60,000 USD) fine for the judge Li Chun-ti.

<p>In August, the <a href="http://www.tpc.moj.gov.tw/mp103.html">Taipei Prosecutors Office</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/taiwan-prosecutors-raid-judges.php">conducted raids</a> [JURIST report] on the homes of several High Court judges and 18 other locations searching for evidence related to the bribery deals. The three High Court judges were <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/taiwan-judicial-officials-arrested-for-corruption.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges in July and were suspended from duty following their arrests. The judges' indictments follows the Taipei High Court's <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?ID=201011080021&Type=aTOD">acquittal</a> [CNA report] last week of former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chen+Shui-bian">news archive</a>] on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">embezzling USD $20 million from banks</a> [JURIST report] that sought to protect themselves during Chen's financial reform program. Chen is also appealing a 20-year sentence for corruption and embezzlement.

Chen was originally found guilty on corruption charges and sentenced to life in prison in September. His wife was also given a life sentence after the pair were convicted on charges of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery and money laundering. Chen has maintained his innocence against all charges, claiming that the current president is using Chen's trial to distance himself from Chen's anti-China views. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110810zor.pdf">declined to hear</a> [order list, PDF] the first preliminary challenge to the recently enacted <a href="http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590ENR/html/BILLS-111hr3590ENR.htm">health care reform law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>]. Former California lawmaker Steve Baldwin, along with the <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice Institute</a> [advocacy website] filed for a writ of <em>certiorari</em> in September, asking the court to <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Baldwin-cert-petition.pdf">review</a> [cert. petition, PDF] the split among district courts over who may or may not sue to challenge the health insurance mandate. Baldwin originally filed suit in the  <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Southern California</a> [official website] where it was determined that he <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/37118232/BALDWIN-v-SEBELIUS-et-al-Healthcare-37-Order-Granting-Motion-to-Dismiss-37-Casd-03704832896">lacked standing</a> [opinion text] because he failed to prove that he had suffered any injury. District Judge Dana Sabraw dismissed the case but conceded that Baldwin would be able to pursue it again if he could prove he sustained an injury from the Act. Subsequent to the district court ruling, Baldwin filed an appeal in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is still pending. Baldwin's suit is aimed at various federal government officials, including those in the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor, which has also raised the question of whether <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Kagan">Justice Elena Kagan</a> [JURIST news archive], as former solicitor general, will recuse herself in cases where she previously played that role. The Supreme Court's order list denying review gives no indication that she will.

<p>Although it was seen as unlikely that the Supreme Court would grant <em>certiorari</em> on a district court issue, commentators predict that the health care bill will eventually become an issue for the court. Last week, voters in Arizona and Oklahoma approved measures to amend their state constitutions to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/voters-consider-laws-seeking-to-bar-health-care-mandate-in-arizona-colorado-oklahoma.php">make the individual insurance mandate unenforceable</a> [JURIST report] in their states. In October, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a group of attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the health care law. The lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">joined by 20 states</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [JURIST reports], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. Also last month, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the individual insurance mandate was constitutional. In August, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a suit brought against the bill for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, conceding that Virginia had standing in alleging the federal bill conflicted with state law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court overturned a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-91.htm">Wilson v. Corcoran</a> [docket], which <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=07-2093_028.pdf">granted <em>habeas</em> relief</a> [opinion, PDF] to Joseph Corcoran, convicted of killing four men and sentenced to the death penalty. The court explained that the <em>habeas</em> ruling affirmed by the appeals court was inappropriately based on a deficiency of Indiana state law:<blockquote>But it is only noncompliance with <em>federal</em> law that renders a State's criminal judgment susceptible to collateral attack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambiguously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to a state prisoner "only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." And we have repeatedly held that "federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law."</blockquote>The court vacated and remanded the Seventh Circuit's grant of <em>habeas</em> relief.

<p>In 1997, an Indiana trial court found Corcoran guilty of four counts of murder. The trial judge sentenced him to death, relying on non-statutory aggravating factors. In 2000, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/">Indiana Supreme Court</a> [official website] vacated the sentence because the trial court may have weighed factors of the innocence of the victims, heinousness of the offense and future dangerousness as aggravating circumstances, and later accepted a revised sentencing order issued in 2002. Corcoran applied for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> in the <a href="http://www.innd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Indiana</a> [official website], arguing that the trial court relied on impermissible aggravating factors. In 2007, the district court granted <em>habeas</em> relief on the grounds that the prosecutor violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] when offering to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a jury trial. In 2008, the appeals court denied the district court's <em>habeas</em> relief, but later granted the petition on remand from the Supreme Court in 2010, arguing that, in order to comply with Indiana law, the trial court needed to reconsider its sentencing determination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Omega</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-hear-copyright.php">report</a>] on whether the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000109----000-.html">first-sale doctrine</a> [17 USC &#167; 109(a)], which provides that the owner of any particular copy "lawfully made under this title" may resell that good without the authority of the copyright holder, applies to imported goods manufactured abroad. Swiss watchmaker <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/">Omega</a> [corporate website] manufactures watches in Switzerland and then sells them to authorized distributors overseas. Watches were purchased by third parties and eventually sold to <a href="http://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> [corporate website], which sold them to US consumers without authorization from Omega. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/09/03/0755368.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to imported goods. Counsel for Costco argued that the Ninth Circuit misinterpreted congressional intent: "According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods better in this respect than goods made in the United States. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any such intent." Counsel for Omega argued "that 'lawfully made under this title' would include a copy that was manufactured in the United States, but that it is not so limited." Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> in support of Omega's position.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-837.pdf">Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-tax-exemption-for-medical-residents.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether medical students working as full-time residents are eligible for the student exception to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_C_20_21.html">Federal Insurance Contributions Act</a> (FICA) [text] taxes imposed on employers and employees. Medical students working for the  <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/">Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester, Minnesota, receive stipends from the foundation and the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.php">University of Minnesota</a> [academic websites] for the medical and patient care services they provide. The district court ruled that residents qualify for the exemption and ordered the US <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/">Treasury Department</a> [official website] to refund FICA taxes paid during the second quarter of 2005 to both Mayo and the university. The US government appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which reviewed the case <em>de novo</em>. The circuit court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/09-837_ca8.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the lower court's holding, concluding that the judiciary must "defer to the regulation limiting this exception to students who are not full-time employees because it is a permissible interpretation of the statute." Counsel for the Mayo Clinic argued that the "services are performed for the purpose of receiving an education," which should qualify the students for the student exception to FICA taxes. Counsel for the US argued that "the Treasury Department has reasonably concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, although Aborigines make up almost three percent of the Australian population, they are not mentioned in the Constitution. The referendum will be among Australia's first steps in efforts to build strong relationships of trust and mutual respect among the natives and the rest of Australia. In the statement, made jointly with <a href="http://www.jennymacklin.net.au/">Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin</a> [official profile], the two officials stressed the need to incorporate native peoples into Australia's founding document:<blockquote>Recognition will demonstrate that we are a country that is united in acknowledging the unique and special place of our first peoples. The Government is pursuing an ambitious agenda to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage, including undertaking major reform and delivering unprecedented investment in early education, health, jobs, housing and services, and infrastructure. Formal recognition in our foundation document will build on this work by publicly acknowledging our history and the significant contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples continue to make to this nation.</blockquote> As part of the process, Gillard and Macklin announced the formation of an expert panel to pose amendment changes that will appeal to the majority of Australians. The <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/">Australian Human Rights Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/about/media/media_releases/2010/110_10.html">voiced support</a> [press release] for such a panel, calling it a "sensible approach" to ensuring that there is a broad pool of views needed to get a consensus on the proposed constitutional changes. The panel is expected to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iJGoDdrEcRHTzW4fUrl4XxjfgCTQ?docId=CNG.74bac5b4cc9462fd7346e1c94b90120a.301">report back to the government</a> [AFP report] with proposed options by the end of 2011 in time for voting to occur in line with the 2013 election. 

<p>In recent years, the Australian government has recognized the long history of discrimination and disadvantage among its native citizens, although its efforts have not always resulted in better conditions. In August, Amnesty International Australia (AIA) <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/australia-racial-discrimination-violates-international-obligations.php">criticized the racial discrimination</a> [JURIST report] that exists in Australia, which, according to AIA, violates the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [texts]. In June, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-reinstates-racial-discrimination-laws.php">reinstated its previously suspended Racial Discrimination Act</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern Territory, which allows governmental authorities to regulate how welfare money is spent by the indigenous people of the country. In March, UN special rapporteur James Anaya <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9891&LangID=E">condemned the law</a> [press release], calling it problematic from a human rights point of view. Last year, Australia <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/australia-endorses-un-declaration-on.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] the aforementioned Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which reversed the position held by previous Australian governments. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd championed the cause of improved living conditions for and relations with Australia's indigenous population during his term in office, and offered and official apology on behalf of the federal government in February 2008 for past mistreatment to the nation's indigenous population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EU noted that many aspects of the elections, which were held Sunday, were incompatible with internationally accepted standards, especially with regards to the bias shown against parties in opposition to the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the ruling military junta. Opposition parties faced limits on their opportunities to campaign as well as restrictions on  their ability to register for the elections. In addition, the elections were characterized by severe restrictions on citizens' freedoms of expression and assembly and limited access to the media. Multiple <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-52721420101107?pageNumber=2">claims alleging fraud</a> [Reuters report] reinforce the notion that the elections were flawed. In Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, many voters were unable to find their names on electoral rolls, and at least six parties filed complaints to the election commission, claiming state workers were forced to vote for the USDP. The EU was not alone in its disapproval of the elections. As a result of the restrictions in place throughout the electoral process, the UK described the elections as a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40003476">missed opportunity for democratic change</a> [AP report]. US President Barack Obama, while delivering a parliamentary address in India, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCIzkTcuAjihQVb8cCVkE7Xl8E_w?docId=CNG.8ef888a34ad6b24189faad729bfc98ea.471">criticized</a> [AFP report] Myanmar's military leaders for stealing the election and also criticized India for its silence on the issue. A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said that the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4911">Secretary followed the elections</a> [statement] and reiterated his call that all political prisoners be released so that the elections could mark a transition to a democratic government.

<p>One party and candidate excluded from the elections was Myanmar's largest opposition party, the <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website] and its leader, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. Suu Kyi was prevented from participating in the elections under Myanmar's <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">current election laws</a> [JURIST report], which include a provision prohibiting political prisoners from seeking public office. In October, Myanmar's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/myanmar-high-court-hears-suu-kyi-appeal.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] Suu Kyi's final appeal of her extended sentence for <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">violation of the terms of her house arrest</a> [JURIST report]. In that appeal, filed in May, lawyers for Suu Kyi argued that she is innocent, and that the election law passed by the ruling junta <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/suu-kyi-files-final-appeal-of-house-arrest-extension.php">should be annulled</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors charged the defendant, identified only by her last name Song, with violating South Korea's National Security Act, which prohibits people from disseminating materials that promote North Korea. A district court dismissed the charges, ruling that, since the songs lacked lyrics, they could not violate the law. An appellate court, however, reversed the district court. The Supreme Court held that the <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2010/11/08/29/0200000000AEN20101108003300315F.HTML">lack of lyrics did not prevent prosecution</a> [<em>Yonhap</em> report] under the law and that the materials should be looked at in context.

<p>In September, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/09/17/abolish-or-fix-national-security-law">criticized South Korea</a> [press release] for using the National Security Act to restrict speech that does not pose a threat to national security. HRW claims that the law "clearly violates South Korea's international human-rights obligations." In 2004, an estimated <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/south-koreans-rally-in-support-of.php">100,000 protesters gathered in support</a> [JURIST report] of the National Security Act. The Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2004/08/korean-constitutional-court-upholds.htm">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] earlier that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an oral ruling, the court relied on the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], asserting that a person cannot be forced from a home without a prior affirmation from a judge that the eviction is legal. The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] has issued similar decisions. To crack down on crime, the Dutch <a href="http://www.tweedekamer.nl/">House of Representatives</a> and <a href="http://www.eerstekamer.nl/">Senate</a> [official websites, in Dutch] imposed a <a href="http://www.eerstekamer.nl/behandeling/20100817/publicatie_wet/f=/vij19efljpx8.pdf">ban on squatting</a> [No. 320; <a href="http://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/31560_initiatiefvoorstel_ten">materials</a>, in Dutch], which took effect on October 1. The law gives prosecutors the ability to vacate criminally squatted buildings without a court order. The court announced their ruling on Monday, as the first evacuations are planned for following day. A written decision will be available next week.

<p>Squatting in the Netherlands has been a tolerated practice for many decades. After Parliament passed legislation banning squatting, squatters in Amsterdam and Nijmegen held protests and riots before the law took effect in October. Previous attempts to ban squatting in 2006 were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, a Dutch court ruled that entering an unused building was not trespassing.  In 2009, the <a href="http://www.domstol.dk/Pages/default.aspx">Eastern High Court of Denmark</a> [official website, in Danish] ruled that the Copenhagen counterculture group <a href="http://www.christiania.org/">Christiana</a> [community website, in Danish] had not <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/denmark-court-rules-counterculture.php">acquired permanent property rights</a> [JURIST report] and no squatters' rights were accrued by the community to the abandoned Copenhagen navy base and that the <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/">Danish government</a> [official website] was within its rights to cancel the group's use of the property. In 2005, 46,000 people were arrested in Zimbabwe's <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/zimbabwe-police-report-46000-arrests.php">squatting sweep</a> [JURIST report] "Operation Restore Order," a highly controversial government initiative to reduce crime and illegal buildings in Harare and other towns. According to the UN and the opposition, the exercise left between 200,000 and 1.5 million people homeless, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, which does not have the power to make the junta comply with its judgment, ruled that Tandja's <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5izQQjtHD_o2F7rfzTgeo0sDb2AAw?docId=CNG.48399dc22534d9ab3ec84a3eb3a25a42.1b1">detention was illegal</a> [AFP report]. Tandja's lawyer said that the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6A70LQ20101108">junta must respect</a> [Reuters report] the court's decision and release his client. The junta, however, has indicated it will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11711218">appeal the ruling</a> [BBC report].

<p>Last week, Nigerian voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved a constitution</a> [JURIST report] limiting presidential powers that military leaders say will aid the transition back to civilian rule. The February coup, which left at least three Nigerien soldiers dead, was in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">referendum abolishing presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report], allowing Tandja to remain in office for three more years and to run in any subsequent elections. Niger's opposition parties denounced the referendum, claiming that Tandja inflated poll numbers to support the new constitution's adoption. After the coup, Nigerien rights group United Front for the Safeguard of Democratic Assets (Fusad), <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-rights-group-urges-prosecution-of.php">called for the prosecution of Tandja</a> [JURIST report] on treason charges. Allied with the opposition party, Fusad claims that Tandja is guilty of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1T7d7-cyXuGezbtZ7VplwCV2ZiA">corruption violating the constitution</a> [AFP report], and alleges that he gave out contracts to foreign oil and uranium firms. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html">Niger</a> [CIA World Factbook profile], which is known for its exportation of uranium, has gone through five constitutions and military regimes since it's founding in 1960.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-islamic-law-ban-challenged.php">suit was brought</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://ok.cair.com/">Oklahoma chapter</a> of the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy websites] and Oklahoma citizen Muneer Awad, who argued that the ban would invalidate part of his will, which is partially rooted in Islamic Sharia Law. Oklahoma voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">overwhelmingly approved the measure</a> [JURIST report], <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/755.pdf?5,5">State Question 755</a> (SQ 755) [text, PDF], in the November 2 mid-term elections with 70 percent of the vote.

<p>SQ 755 would prevent Oklahoma courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures," requiring them only to look to legal precedents of other states for guidance, provided that state does not use Islamic law. It was sponsored by state <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/committees/member.aspx?memberid=54">Representative Rex Duncan</a> (R) [official website], who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">described it as a preemptive strike</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma.

Still, the <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/02/oklahomans-vote-on-sharia-law-ban/">necessity of the amendment has been questioned</a> [CNN report] due to the fact that the use of Islamic law in US courts would likely violate the First Amendment prohibition on laws respecting an establishment of religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Counsel for the plaintiffs, including Awlaki's father, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/obama-administration-claims-unchecked-authority-kill-americans-outside-combat-zone">argued against</a> the government's right to kill any US citizen labeled a terrorist without a court warrant and <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/obama-administration-claims-unchecked-authority-kill-americans-outside-comba">demanded</a> [press releases] it disclose the standards for authorizing the targeted killings outside of combat zones of individuals considered threats to national security. Lawyers for the government argued the case should be <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-invokes-state-secrets-in-effort-to-block-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">dismissed on procedural grounds</a>, saying Awlaki's father, a citizen of Yemen, has no legal standing to bring the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] and that the case <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/world/middleeast/09Awlaki.html">involves state secrets</a> [NYT report] the court is not permitted to examine. ACLU Deputy Legal Director, Jameel Jaffer, who presented arguments for the plaintiffs, said the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Fifth Amendments</a> [texts] present limits to the government's power to target American citizens:<blockquote>If the Constitution means anything, it surely means that the president does not have unreviewable authority to summarily execute any American whom he concludes is an enemy of the state. It's the government's responsibility to protect the nation from terrorist attacks, but the courts have a crucial role to play in ensuring that counterterrorism policies are consistent with the Constitution.</blockquote>The arguments took place on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites and found by <a href="https://www.siteintelgroup.com/_layouts/SiteIntel/aboutsite.aspx?setnav=About%20SITE">SITE intelligence group</a> [official website]. In the 23-minute video, Awlaki speaks in Arabic to jihadists, telling them <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602924126951244.html">no special permission is needed</a> [WSJ report] to kill Americans or any enemies of Muslims. Awlaki, a suspected member of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is believed to be linked to Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooting suspect, as well as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Last week, Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners. Awlaki is believed to be hiding in Yemen and was charged <em>in absentia</em>. US officials have labeled Awlaki as a terrorist and have placed him on a list to be captured or killed. The Yemeni government has sent forces on a counter-terrorism operation into the Province of Shabwa, where it is believed that Awlaki is hiding. In August, the ACLU and the CCR <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/treasury-department-to-issue-license-for-terror-suspect-defense.php">obtained</a> a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) license that enables them to represent Awlaki, but announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-to-continue-suit-against-terror-suspect-defense-licensing.php">still pursuing a legal challenge</a> [JURIST reports] to the licensing scheme. The Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its use of targeted killings, specifically those made by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drone">unmanned predator drone strikes</a> [JURIST news archive]. <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department Legal Adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] has said the drones "comply with all applicable law" because they target only military targets and enable minimal damage to civilians and civilian structures. Last October, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] noted that the use of unmanned drones by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

A judge for Nigeria's <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/High%20Courts.htm">Federal High Court</a> [official website] in Lagos ruled Monday that an amendment to the <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">1999 Nigerian Constitution</a> [text] made by the <a href="http://www.nassnig.org/">National Assembly</a> (NASS) [official website] cannot become operational law without the assent of the president. Justice Okechukwu Okeke <a href="http://www.independentngonline.com/DailyIndependent/Article.aspx?id=23527">ruled</a> [<em>Daily Independent </em> report] that the NASS's refusal to forward the amendment to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8510390.stm">President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goodluck+jonathan">news archive</a>] for approval violated Section 58 of the Constitution. The court determined that the proposed amendment would remain inchoate until presented to the president. The amendment, known as the <a href="http://placng.org/gazzette%20of%20the%20electoral%20act.pdf">Constitution (First Amendment) Act 2010</a> [text, PDF], concerns the election process and was approved by the NASS and a two-thirds majority of the State Houses of Assembly. The challenge was brought to the court by Olisa Agbakoba, former president of the <a href="http://www.nba.org.ng/web/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [official website]. The NASS lawyers asked to court to throw out the lawsuit, stating that only the attorney general has the authority to this type of challenge. Representatives for the NASS plan to appeal the ruling. 

<p>The Constitution (First Amendment) Act 2010 was passed in June. It repeals the Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2006 in order to re-instate the Nigerian <a href="http://www.inecnigeria.org/">Independent National Election Commission</a> (INEC) [official website]. The INEC regulates the conduct of federal, state and local council elections and similar matters. Also in June, the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nigeria-senate-passes-revisions-clarifying-presidential-succession.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] revisions to the Constitution that would clarify the exercise of executive authority in absence of the president. The constitutional revisions would also change federal election law. It would remove a provision of the constitution that disallowed people who had been charged with fraud from standing for election and would require candidates for federal office to have a degree beyond secondary education. The 2011 presidential election will be the first since the death of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">Umaru Yar'Adua</a> [BBC obituary] in May. Former vice president Jonathan assumed the presidency in February after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-vp-takes-over-for-ailing.php">parliament voted</a> [JURIST report] for him to step in for the ailing Yar'Adua.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The recommendations stem from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-defends-rights-record-at-first-ever-un-review.php">report</a>] of the US government's human rights record before the UNHRC in Geneva. The list of 228 recommendations by other nations included <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_UN_US_HUMAN_RIGHTS?SITE=VABRM&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">repeated calls to abolish the death penalty</a> [AP report], as well as reduce overcrowding in prisons, ratify international treaties on the rights of women and children, and increase measures to prevent racial profiling. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department legal adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] responded to the recommendations by stating that capital punishment is not precluded by international law. Koh also said the US government would take the recommendations into consideration to strengthen its commitment to human rights and comply with international standards. This was the US government's first UPR evaluation before the UNHRC.

<p>At the opening of the fifteenth session of the UNHRC in September, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] emphasized the need for protection of human rights both during emergencies and on a regular basis. However, she <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-rights-chief-chides-countries-over-human-rights-records.php">chided countries</a> [JURIST report], including the US, France, China and Russia, for ongoing human rights violations. In August, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-releases-human-rights-review.php">released its human rights review</a> [JURIST report] and presented the report to the UNHRC. In the report, the DOS acknowledged the US government's historical struggle with some human rights issues including gender and racial equality, but noted the progress made in both areas. The Obama administration received criticism from both human rights groups and US politicians for initially <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/02/116401.htm">not taking part</a> [press release] in the UPR sessions, a process which each of the 192 <a href="/hotline/2010/03/un-human-rights-councils-upr-process.php">UN member states must undergo every four years</a> [JURIST comment]. The US was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-elected-to-seat-on-un-rights-council.php">elected to the UNHRC</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. The UNHRC was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-un-approves-human-rights.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, at which time the Bush administration declined to seek a Council seat or participate in its proceedings due to a perceived anti-Israeli sentiment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Concepcion</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-five-cases.php">report</a>] on whether the <a  href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/9/usc_sup_01_9.html">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text], which provides for judicial facilitation of private dispute resolution through arbitration when the transaction involves interstate commerce, preempts states from enforcing alternate solutions when arbitration clauses are considered unconscionable. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/27/08-56394.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the FAA does not preempt a California unconscionability law, which allowed a class action against AT&#38;T mobile despite a contractual clause prohibiting such proceedings. Counsel for AT&#38;T argued that the Ninth Circuit's "interpretation of section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act would permit a State to oppose in arbitration any procedure employed in court and thereby require arbitration to be a carbon copy of litigation, precisely what the Act was designed to prevent." Counsel for the respondents argued:<blockquote>The State law at issue here is not preemptive, for three reasons. First, it is consistent with the equal footing principle or nondiscrimination principle that this Court has consistently recognized is embodied in section 2. Second, it's consistent with two key purposes that the savings clause fulfills under the FAA: ensuring that arbitration is a matter of consent and not coercion; and that it represents merely a choice of forum, but not an exemption from the law. And third, the State law at issue is a correct and legitimate application of the State's common law to which this Court should defer.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1088.pdf">Cullen v. Pinholster</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether to reinstate the death penalty against defendant Scott Pinholster. Pinholster was convicted of the 1984 killing of two men during a burglary in Los Angeles. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned Pinholster's death sentence, finding that his lawyer failed to disclose evidence of mental illness to the jury. Counsel for the petitioner argued that:<blockquote>because the California Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pinholster's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on its merits, Federal habeas corpus relief is unavailable under 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1) unless Mr. Pinholster first met his burden of demonstrating that the State court rejection of his claim was unreasonable. He did not do that in this case, and thus the lower courts erred in granting him habeas corpus relief.</blockquote>Counsel for Pinholster argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling should be upheld because the court applied the correct standard.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontstl.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The head of the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official website] has rejected two motions requesting the disqualification of judges on the grounds of bias. Judge Antonio Cassese on Friday denied the motions filed by Lebanese General Jamil El-Sayed, determining that El-Sayed failed to provide convincing evidence that judges <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/counsel/20101020_OTP-AC-2010-01_Counsel_Submission_2_En%20Translation.pdf">Afif Chamseddine</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/President/CH-PRESS-2010-09_President%2020101105.pdf">judgment</a>, PDF]  and <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/counsel/20101103_OTP-AC-2010-01_Counsel_Submission_EN%20translation.pdf">Ralph Riachy</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/President/CH-PRES-2010-08_President%2020101105.pdf">judgment</a>, PDF] are biased. El-Sayed had argued that, because the judges were nominated by the government of Lebanon, which was subsequently "condemned" by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, they were biased or at least appeared biased. In his ruling Cassese noted the importance of impartiality to the judicial system, but also warned against false accusations of bias:<blockquote>I firmly believe that, while Judges must be absolutely free and appear to be free from any preconceived beliefs, it is also necessary for them to be sheltered from mere innuendoes as to their professional past or their current attitude. If they were not so safeguarded, they would be unable to discharge their difficult mission with equanimity. Charges of bias unsupported by compelling evidence can only sow confusion and uncertainty in the mind of all those who watch the unfolding of international justices, as well as trouble the conscience of Judges, thereby affecting their serenity. The Tribunal will firmly reject any attempt at guesswork or speculation intended to project onto the Tribunal political motivations that instead are, and shall always remain, extraneous to it, as is fitting and appropriate for any proper court of law.</blockquote>Cassese acknowledged that El-Sayed's contention, if accepted, would essentially preclude any Lebanese judge from sitting on the tribunal, contrary to its design as a mixed-composition tribunal.  

<p>The STL is the UN-backed tribunal charged with investigating the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">Rafik Hariri</a> [JURIST news archive].  The STL is expected to <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/11/08/Hariri-tribunal-overturns-challenge/UPI-68331289232340/">issue indictments</a> [UPI report], possibly in December, and may name members of Lebanese resistance movement <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9155/hezbollah_aka_hizbollah_hizbullah.html">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder] in connection with the assassination. Last month, the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile], called for all Lebanese to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/hezbollah-leader-calls-for-boycott-of-un-backed-lebanon-tribunal.php">boycott the STL</a> [JURIST report]. In August, Hezbollah officials submitted evidence to the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">linking Israel to Hariri's death</a> in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">request by the tribunal</a> [JURIST reports] to turn over all information relating to the assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Citing the repeal of Chapter VIII, section 69 of the <a href = "http://www.kenyalaw.org/Downloads/GreyBook/8.%20The%20Penal%20Code.pdf">Kenyan penal code</a> [text, PDF] as the basis for his decision, <a href = "http://www.judiciary.go.ke/judiciary/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:justice-mohamed-ibrahim&catid=109:high-court-judges&Itemid=347">Justice Mohamed Ibrahim</a> [official profile] concluded that the suspects, who were arrested in March 2009 in the Indian Ocean by German and US troops, did not violate the territorial waters of Kenya. Section 69 was repealed by the <a href = "http://www.kenyalaw.org/Downloads/Acts/The_Merchant_Shipping_Act_2009.pdf">Merchant Shipping Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF], signed into law in June 2009, which replaced the original penal code language with, in section 371, "any person who (a) commits any act of piracy; (b) in territorial waters, commits any act of armed robbery against ships shall be liable, upon conviction, to imprisonment for life." Ibrahim expressed concern for the suspects' safety and ordered that they be put in the custody of the UN High Commission of Refugees. In April, Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said that Kenya would <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer accept Somali pirate cases</a> [JURIST report], although there are currently <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6A81SI20101109">84 pirates still waiting to be tried</a> [Reuters] in Kenyan courts.

<p>The UN has urged other nations to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/un-urges-nations-to-assist-kenya-in-conducting-piracy-trials.php">provide assistance to Kenya</a> in conducting pirate trials and has aided by <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">opening a high-security courtroom</A> and <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">donating USD $9.3 million</a> [JURIST reports] to fund piracy trials. The UN has also <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/un-considers-new-international-tribunal-for-piracy-trials.php">considered creating an international tribunal</a> [JURIST report] to take pressure off of Kenya. Earlier this month, Kenya acquitted <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-court-acquits-17-on-piracy-charges.php">17 accused pirates</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested in the Gulf of Aden by the US and South Korean navies.

The initial <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/7286472.html">complaint</a> [AP report] in the case, filed by anti-corruption groups <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> (TI) and <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/">SHERPA</a> [advocacy websites], accused the late Omar Bongo of Gabon, Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea and their relatives of acquiring luxury homes and cars in France with African public funds. The high court's decision allowing the investigation to proceed overturned a lower court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-court-refuses-to-hear.php">halted the investigation</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that activists could not bring suits against foreign heads of state. In response to Tuesday's ruling, TI noted that a judge will now be able to <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2010/2010_11_9_paris">determine how the assets were acquired</a> [press release] and what role banking institutions may have played in the alleged money laundering scheme. TI indicated that the ruling may allow those affected by the corruption to seek restitution, a right guaranteed by the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html">UN Convention Against Corruption</a> [materials], which France signed in 2005. TI also expressed hope that the investigation will help to overcome the reluctance to prosecute similar politically and financially sensitive cases in the future.

<p>The complaint in the case was originally filed after a <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-52780820101109">2007 police inquiry</a> [Reuters report] listed French properties, bank accounts and other assets held by the three African leaders and their relatives. A French magistrate heard the case in 2009 and ruled that the <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/il-n-y-aura-pas-d-enquete-sur-les-biens-des-chefs-d-etat-africains-29-10-2009-692176.php">suit could move forward</a> [<em>Le Parisien</em> report, in French], but French state prosecutors appealed the decision to the Paris Court of Appeals, which refused to hear the case. The case is sensitive for France, with Gabon as a former colony. France has struggled with how to reconcile its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=french+colonial">colonial history</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In GLAD's <a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/pedersen-v-opm/2010-11-09-pedersen-complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.glad.org/current/pr-detail/glad-files-second-suit-against-federal-doma">press release</a>], several plaintiffs are challenging the denial of certain marriage benefits and protections that are available to similarly situation heterosexual couples in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. The plaintiffs have been denied these benefits because, according to DOMA, "'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." GLAD's Legal Director Gary Buseck said:<blockquote>Every day that DOMA stands, it arbitrarily divides married couples into two categories. And the extra burdens that DOMA has imposed on Massachusetts families since 2004 are now being endured by families in Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire.</blockquote> In the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-11-9-WindsorvUS-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/bereaved-spouse-challenges-defense-marriage-act-unconstitutional">press release</a>], filed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], plaintiff Edith Windsor is challenging provisions of DOMA that deprive of her certain tax deductions she would receive as a widow.

<p>In October, the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/doj-to-appeal-rulings-striking-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed two notices of appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website], defending DOMA. In July, Judge Joseph Tauro ruled that the DOMA definition of marriage as between a man and a woman is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because it interferes with the states' right to define marriage. The Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-extends-benefits-to-same-sex.php">extended some federal benefits</a> [JURIST report] to same-sex couples, including allowing domestic partners to be added to insurance programs, to use medical facilities, and to be included in family size and house allocation considerations.

US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] special prosecutor John Durham "has concluded that he will not pursue criminal charges for the destruction of the interrogation videotapes," said DOJ spokesperson Matthew Miller. Durham was appointed in 2008 by then-attorney general Michael Mukasey to investigate the circumstances surrounding the destruction of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">CIA videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] of the interrogation of suspected al Qaeda operatives Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, which allegedly depicted numerous instances of violence and "enhanced interrogation techniques" alleged to be torture. According to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/destroyed-cia-interrogation-tapes.php">report</a>] obtained and released by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], former CIA head of clandestine services Jose Rodriguez ordered his staff to destroy the tapes on November 9, 2005, after hiding their existence from the September 11 Commission, reportedly out of fear of backlash against the intelligence agency that might result if the tapes were made public. The DOJ's announcement coincides with the expiration Tuesday of the five-year statute of limitations for bringing obstruction of justice charges. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/government-officials-hook-destruction-torture-tapes">criticized</a> [press release] the decision:<blockquote>This decision is stunning &#8212; there is ample evidence of a cover up regarding the destruction of the tapes. The Bush administration was instructed by a court of law not to destroy evidence of torture, but that's exactly what it did. The destruction of these tapes showed complete disdain for the rule of law. ... Prosecutor Durham was charged with a criminal investigation into torture, and that investigation must include the people at the top, not just low-ranking officials. We cannot say that we live under the rule of law unless we are clear that no one is above the law.</blockquote> The DOJ's announcement does not rule out the possibility of other charges against CIA officials in connection with the interrogation of Zubaydah and al-Nashiri, and there is speculation that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/09/AR2010110904106.html">other charges could still be filed</a> [WP report], including ones related to obstruction of Durham's three-year investigation. Other charges still may come out of Attorney General Eric Holder's 2009 expansion of the probe to include investigations of CIA operatives' conduct during other interrogations at the agency's numerous <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=black+site">"black site"</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facilities, investigations that remain ongoing.</p>

<p>Internal CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] released in April <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that agency head Porter Goss may have supported the destruction of the videotapes. The documents, which are heavily redacted, show that Goss agreed with Rodriguez's order to destroy the tapes, despite being unaware of the order before it was carried out. Last year, it was revealed  that 12 of the 92 tapes destroyed by the CIA contained evidence of "enhanced interrogation techniques." The DOJ had previously acknowledged that the CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 videotapes in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the  tapes or provide specific justifications of why it could not release the information. </p>]]></content:encoded>

They were <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-prosecutors-indict-11-suspected.php">charged by a federal grand jury</a> [JURIST report] in April, along with six others accused of attacking the USS Ashland in the Gulf of Aden.

<p>Several other suspected Somali pirates have faced charges in federal court this year.

In 2008, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+milk">melamine-tainted milk from China</a> [JURIST news archive] was blamed for the deaths of six infants, and the Chinese government promised that all tainted product would be seized and destroyed. Zhao organized a website, "Kidney Stone Babies," and established a support group, furnishing information and resources to parents whose children were sickened or killed by melamine-tainted milk. Zhao's own four-year-old son became sick after consuming milk containing melamine, which is used in plastics and fertilizer production. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/china%E2%80%99s-sentence-milk-scandal-activist-condemned-2010-11-10">condemned the sentence</a> after previously expressing <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/064/2009/en/1b804c02-1ad4-4867-b8c0-81dcd2f0e3ee/asa170642009en.html">concern</a> [press releases] that Zhao's detention put him "at risk" for torture. AI Deputy Director for the Asia-Pacific Catherine Baber said:<blockquote>We are appalled that the authorities have imprisoned a man the Chinese public rightly view as a protector of children, not a criminal. Zhao Lianhai should never have been arrested for organizing a self-help group and exercising his legal rights to seek compensation from a commercial firm.</blockquote>In 2009, as compensation claims began going to court, Beijing police <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-police-formally-arrest-tainted.php">issued a formal arrest warrant and charged</a> [JURIST report] Zhao with picking quarrels and provoking trouble. According to AI, authorities denied Zhao access to a lawyer and visitation rights with his family during his detention.

<p>The problem of tainted Chinese milk is not subsiding, despite Chinese government promises to the contrary. In September, police in China's Shanxi province <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/seven-arrested-in-china-for-melamine-tainted-powdered-milk.php">arrested seven individuals</a> [JURIST report], including the executive of a dairy company, after that company's powdered milk was found to contain melamine. In July, Chinese authorities discovered <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392414.htm">64 tons of raw dairy materials</a> [Xinhua report] contaminated with melamine in Qinghai province. In February, Chinese police <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-police-arrest-3-for-involvement.php">arrested three individuals</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 2008 tainted milk scandal. Two other individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-executes-two-men-for-roles-in.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 after being convicted of endangering public safety and selling toxic food. Chinese courts <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-court-hears-first-tainted-milk.php">began hearing</a> [JURIST report] tainted milk suits in 2009, after families began filing individual claims. Also in 2009, a Chinese court declared Sanlu Group, the Chinese company that produced the melamine-tainted milk, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-court-declares-tainted-milk-dairy.php">bankrupt</a> [JURIST report]. In 2008, China's Hebei Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-court-rejects-tainted-milk-class.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] out the possibility of initiating a class action lawsuit on behalf of the contaminated milk victims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] insisted that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-sg-cambodia-genocide-court-to-decide-on-future-of-khmer-rouge-trials.php">ECCC will decide whether to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] additional Khmer Rouge officers as part of an "international judicial process." Ban called for those responsible to be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4878">held accountable</a> [text] for the tragic events that allegedly caused the death of more than two million civilians between 1975 and 1979. In September, the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-genocide-court-indicts-4-ex-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] four former Khmer Rouge leaders who have been detained since 2007 and are charged with crimes against humanity, genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and offenses under the Cambodian Criminal Code 1956. The ECCC handed down its <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">first conviction</a> [JURIST report] of a former Khmer Rouge official in July. <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/caseInfo001.aspx">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], also known as "Duch," was found guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In August, lawyers for Duch filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-appeals-conviction.php">notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of his conviction, and in September, the prosecution filed its own <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/cambodia-genocide-prosecutors-to-appeal-ex-khmer-rouge-leader-sentence.php">notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] seeking to increase Kaing's term of imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.btplc.com/newsadmin/attachments/statement%20of%20facts%20and%20grounds.pdf">claim</a> [text, PDF] was filed by UK Internet service providers (ISPs) <a href="http://www.btplc.com/">BT Group PLC</a> and <a href="https://sales.talktalk.co.uk/products/broadband/?portalId=TALKTALK">TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC</a> [corporate websites] in July in response to the legislation being rushed through parliament by the previous Labour government just weeks before the general election in May. BT and TalkTalk claim that the bill was not given adequate scrutiny before its passage and may require certain amendments in order to <a href="http://www.btplc.com/News/Articles/ShowArticle.cfm?ArticleID=98284B3F-B538-4A54-A44F-6B496AF1F11F">comply with EU rules</a> [press release] on privacy and policing by ISPs. The ISPs also <a href="http://www.talktalkgroup.com/press-centre/news/press-office/168/digital-economy-bill-cannot-protect-copyright">claim</a> [press release] that Internet users are already moving away from peer-to-peer (P2P) content sharing and that "[t]he measures in the [legislation] will hasten the migration away from P2P, ignite the development of new tools and popularise the notion that stealing content is socially acceptable." The court did not disclose a time frame for the review.

<p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/uk-parliament-passes-anti-piracy-law.php">approved the legislation</a> [JURIST report] in April authorizing the suspension of Internet service for those who repeatedly download copyrighted material illegally. The act also received <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100408-0013.htm#10040856001075">Royal Assent</a> [text] and is now law. The law calls on ISPs to block download sites, reduce a user's broadband speeds and ultimately shut down a user's Internet access in order to prevent piracy of copyrighted materials. The bill, known as a three-strikes law, imposes stricter penalties on repeat digital offenders than had previously existed, and has received a great deal of public criticism. Despite the controversy over the legislation, MPs who support it say it is a necessary step to protect the creators of digital content. Last week, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced that Britain's <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-prime-minister-announces-intellectual-property-reforms.php">intellectual property laws will undergo a review</a> [JURIST report] with an eye towards modernization, in an effort to encourage innovation and small business. Cameron suggested that the law may be reformed in order to allow for increased use of copyright material without the owner's permission. The announcement, seen as an attempt to restore balance after the controversial Digital Economy Act, has been cheered by Internet freedom campaigners and small businesses alike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The groups allege that the Czech government has failed to implement a November 2007 <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=825443&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">decision</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/echr-rules-against-separate-schooling.php">report</a>], which determined that the Czech Republic indirectly discriminated against Roma children. The ECHR found that the Czech Republic violated article 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], read in conjunction with article 2 of protocol 1, by segregating the children in schools for children with mental disabilities. The complaint alleges that the situation of Roma children has remained unchanged since the 2007 judgment. In some cities, Roma children are still 27 times more likely to be sent to schools for the mentally disabled than non-Roma children, and, nationally, Roma children are 12 times more likely than their non-Roma counterparts to attend schools where they receive an inferior education. OJSI executive director James Goldston <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/equality_citizenship/news/roma-education-czech-20101110">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Each year since the Grand Chamber issued its judgment, Romani children in the Czech Republic have continued to be shunted into sub-standard schools and classes for the mentally disabled. The Committee of Ministers should demand an immediate halt to segregation of Romani children and adoption within six months of the legal and budgetary measures essential to secure equal opportunity.</blockquote>The complaint also alleges that governments of Greece and Croatia have also continued to discriminate against Roma children. The Committee of Ministers will meet on November 30 to consider the Czech Republic's advancement in desegregating its schools. The Committee will also consider the cases involving illegal segregation in Greece and Croatia. 

<p>Other countries have also faced criticism for their treatment of Roma migrants. Last month, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] announced that it was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/eu-suspends-legal-complaint-regarding-france-roma-expulsion.php">temporarily postponing the human rights complaint</a> [JURIST report] filed against France over the country's failure to respect the EU's <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/l33152_en.htm">Free Movement Directive of 2004</a> [Directive 2004/38/EC materials] in its expulsion of Roma. In September, the EC asked the French government to enact legislation guaranteeing that procedural safeguards would be put in place in order to protect EU citizens against "arbitrary, discriminatory or disproportionate decisions." Also in September, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged EU members to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-group-urges-eu-nations-to-stop-forced-roma-deportation.php">stop forcibly deporting Roma migrants to Kosovo</a> [JURIST report]. In August, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/">Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> [official website] expressed concern with the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-race-committee-calls-for-end-to-discrimination-against-roma.php">discrimination faced by Roma migrants</a> [JURIST report] in numerous European countries. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The CCM, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/cluster-munitions-treaty-goes-into-effect.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] as binding international law in August, bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster bombs&#8212;weapons that break apart, releasing large numbers of smaller, self-contained explosives that spread out before detonating on impact. The purpose of the meeting was to bring state parties, UN agencies, international organizations, civil society and cluster munitions survivors together to discuss plans on the convention's implementation. Migiro also praised the progress that has been made since the implementation of the ban:<blockquote>The Convention on Cluster Munitions has given a great boost to international humanitarian law. It is unambiguous in banning the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. It sets out clear obligations for clearing unexploded ordnance, for educating populations about the risks they face, and for assisting victims. It provides a framework for action in post-conflict scenarios, with strong provisions for international assistance and national planning. ... Until recently, many governments considered cluster munitions indispensable to their military strategies. But they proved themselves open to the arguments of those who said that such policies and practices were out of step with international norms - that they caused indiscriminate harm, and could jeopardize a country's recovery and development.</blockquote>Beyond the ban, the UN wants to implement other elements of the treaty that call for assisting victims, donating assistance and cooperating with affected countries. Since its adoption in August, the convention now boasts increasing support in a recent update of 108 signatures and 45 countries that have ratified the treaty. 

<p>The CCM was officially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/cluster-munitions-treaty-opened-for.php">opened for signature</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 at a conference in Oslo, Norway. It has been deemed one of  the most significant disarmament and humanitarian treaties in more than a decade since the implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997 that prohibited the use and stockpiling of antipersonnel mines. The US is one of the countries that still has not signed the treaty. The US claims that the ban  would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/cluster-bomb-ban-would-impede.php">impede humanitarian efforts</a> [JURIST report] by discouraging cooperation with non-signatories. However, the US did adopt a formal <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d20080709cmpolicy.pdf">policy</a> [text, PDF] on cluster munitions in June 2008 "intended to minimize the potential unintended harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure."</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether its decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/533/53/case.html">Nguyen v. Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> [opinion text] permits gender discrimination that has no biological basis. Ruben Flores-Villar raised a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge to two former sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1401.html">8 USC &#167; 1401(a)(7)</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1409.html">8 USC &#167; 1409</a> [texts], which impose a five-year residence requirement, after the age of 14, on US citizen fathers, but not on US citizen mothers, before they may transmit citizenship to a child born out of wedlock abroad to a non-citizen. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/08/06/0750445.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the provisions survive intermediate scrutiny. Counsel for Flores-Villar argued:<blockquote>In Nguyen, the Court approved the imposition of legitimation requirement only upon fathers of non-marital children born abroad. That was based on biological differences between men and women. It provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity to make a relationship with the child that adhered in birth as to the mother.</p>

<p>But here, the residential requirements that are at issue here have no biological basis. They set up barriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger fathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based upon gender stereotypes that women, not men, would care -- would care for non-marital children.</blockquote>Counsel for the US argued:<blockquote>Congress in deciding who among the various people born abroad should be made citizens of the United States has to take into account myriad factors that may bear on that question and its judgment. They include importantly Congress's prediction in the case of conferring citizenship at birth, what would be that person's likely connection to the United States. Congress also has to consider the interaction with the laws of other countries where these people may be born. It may take into account equities, potential statelessness or dual nationality. These are complicated questions to which the courts should defer.</blockquote>Flores-Villar argues the court should apply intermediate scrutiny, while the government argues for rational basis review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeal is largely symbolic, as Suu Kyi is scheduled to be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-official-says-suu-kyi-to-be.php">released</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday. However, Suu Kyi's lawyers fear that the ruling could be a sign that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11732151">conditions will be attached</a> [BBC report] to her release. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/myanmar-high-court-to-consider-hearing-suu-kyi-appeal.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in October that it would hear the appeal that Suu Kyi lodged in May. Despite a scheduled hearing for October 18, the court waited until after Sunday's <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to decide against Suu Kyi. The elections were the first held in Myanmar in 20 years, and have received heavy international criticism. Suu Kyi's lawyers indicated that she will not accept any conditions on her release, and it is anticipated that she will <a href="http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=20040">assist in a challenge</a> [AP report] against the election results in which the ruling party maintained its hold on power. 

<p>Suu Kyi was prohibited from participating in the election under current Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">election laws</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/suu-kyi-files-challenge-to-myanmar-dissolution-of-opposition-party.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court challenging the dissolution of the <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website]. In June, an independent UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-release-of-suu-kyi.php">called for the release</a> [JURIST report] of Suu Kyi and other political prisoners in Myanmar, claiming their continued detention "contravenes international human rights law and casts a long shadow over planned elections in the country." Suu Kyi originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/suu-kyi-files-suit-in-myanmar-to-stop.php">challenged the election law</a> [JURIST report] dissolving the NLD in April, but her suit was rejected. In March, the NLD <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-opposition-party-boycotting.php">announced</a> that it would not take part in the nation's first elections in 20 years after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-high-court-rejects-suu-kyi.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] a lawsuit brought by the NLD to repeal the election laws preventing Suu Kyi from participating. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The FCC did not reveal any details, but stated that the investigation was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704804504575606831614327598.html?KEYWORDS=google">officially opened earlier this year</a> [WSJ report]. If Google is found to have intentionally violated federal communications law, including electronic eavesdropping laws, the company could face fines of up to $50,000 for each violation.  Members of Congress have also indicated that the incident could factor into new Internet privacy legislation that will be considered next year.

<p>The FCC is the most recent government organization to initiate an investigation into the breach, which has come under international scrutiny. Earlier this month, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/"> Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] announced that the company <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">committed a "significant breach"</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] when Street View vehicles inadvertently collected personal information over WiFi networks including passwords, e-mails and URLs. In October, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's internal policies and procedures that led to the breach. Also in October, <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.cfm">Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart</a> [official website] announced that the Street View breach <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF]. Investigations were also initiated in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">South Korea</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports]. Additionally, earlier this month, Google announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-announces-settlement-in-buzz-privacy-class-action-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit regarding privacy breaches related to its Google Buzz social networking program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court stated that the government wrongfully denied the asylum seekers, who wanted to apply for visas, access to the Australian legal system. The plaintiffs entered the Australian territory of Christmas Island by boat and were detained under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s189.html">section 189(3)</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/">Migration Act of 1958</a> [text], which provides that "If an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in an excised offshore place is an unlawful non-citizen, the officer may detain the person." Upon detention, the <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/">Department of Immigration and Citizenship</a> [official website] conducted a <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/75processing-unlawful-boat-arrivals.htm#d">Refugee Status Assessment</a> (RSA) [overview] for each of the plaintiffs and concluded that neither plaintiff was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations. The investigators who conducted <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/09litigation.htm">Independent Merits Reviews</a> (IMR) [overview], third-party RSA reviews requested by the plaintiffs, reached the same conclusion. The plaintiffs were unable to challenge the RSA and IMR inquiries because they were being held at offshore detention centers. The court held that the reviewer who conducted the RSA made an error of law by not treating provisions of the Migration Act and court precedent as binding. The ruling also establishes that asylum seekers who arrive by boat must be treated as those who arrive by plane. The ruling could force the Australian government to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11732148">review its offshore processing policy</a> [BBC report] for asylum seekers. 

<p>Australia's immigrant processing system has undergone a number of changes in recent years. In April, Australia <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/media-releases/2010/ce10029.htm">temporarily suspended</a> [press release, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/australia-temporarily-suspends.php">report</a>] processing of all asylum claims from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan because of improved security situations in those countries. The <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/house/index.htm">Australian House of Representatives</a> [official website], in August 2006, approved the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/mauab2006521/">Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorized Arrivals) Bill</a> [text] requiring asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat to be <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/australia-house-approves-bill.php">processed in offshore camps</a> [JURIST report], rather than on the mainland. A <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/australia-court-rules-refugees-on.php">November 2006 judgment</a> [JURIST report] by the High Court of Australia held that a "holder of a temporary protection visa is not entitled to further protection in Australia if they are no longer in danger in the country from which they fled" and that the person may not remain a refugee. Australia's <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Human_Rights/immigration/detention_rights.html#2">mandatory detention</a> [AHRC backgrounder] policy, which requires any non-citizen without a visa seeking entry to be detained, had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/un-criticizes-australian-illegal.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chen Shui-bian and his wife were accused of taking more than $20 million in bribes from banks and financial institutions that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program. The pair were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009 after being convicted of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery and money laundering.

He <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention in January 2009.

The filing is in response to a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DADT-10A465-vacate-application.pdf">petition filed last week</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-asks-supreme-court-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> [advocacy website] asking the court to overturn the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">indefinite extension</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-temporarily-blocks-suspension-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. The government asked the court not to interrupt the policy while it is being considered in lower courts. Additionally, the filing contends that the Log Cabin Republicans bear a heavy burden in asking to overturn the indefinite extension:<blockquote>An applicant for vacatur of a stay pending appeal granted by a court of appeals ordinarily must demonstrate, first, a reasonable probability that the case will eventually come before this Court for plenary consideration; second, a significant possibility that a majority of the Court eventually will agree with the District Court's decision; and, third, that the failure to vacate the stay probably will cause irreparable harm that outweighs the irreparable harm to the government from a vacatur of the stay.</blockquote>The filing notes that President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates oppose the policy, but also stresses their support for the repeal of the policy through legislative measures, citing the need for deliberation, advance planning and training before transitioning from the 17-year-old policy. 

<p>Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy. On Sunday, Gates called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Gates issued a memorandum <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior Department of Defense officials. In September, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a US Air Force officer to be reinstated after being previously discharged under DADT. Also in September, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">rejected a cloture motion</a> [JURIST report] on a defense appropriations bill that would have repealed the policy. In May, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official websites] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">voted to repeal the policy</a> after Obama and Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">agreed to a compromise</a> [JURIST reports] that would prevent the repeal from taking effect until the completion of a review to determine what effects the repeal would have on military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed in July</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] alleges that the state has limited the couples' decision-making powers regarding their health care and finances. The complaint argues that the Montana Constitution says "no person shall be denied equal protection under the laws," but the state legislature has failed to pass legislation in various fields to protect same-sex couples. It requests that the court order the state to offer "same-sex couples and their families a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry, but not the status or designation of marriage." Bullock's motion notes several protections that same-sex couples do receive and argues that the courts cannot deliver the requested relief:<blockquote>Lesbian, gay, and bisexual Montanans have suffered social stigma and discrimination, but Plaintiffs do not allege any state action that has caused these effects. ... By definition -- a definition contained in the Montana Constitution -- these spousal benefit laws do not apply to them. Instead of challenging any law now on the books, Plaintiffs ask the Court to require the enactment of a new law extending spousal benefits beyond the constitutional definition of marriage. Because this relief requires the exercise of the legislative rather than the judicial power, and because spousal benefits do not violate the Montana Constitution, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</blockquote>The motion also argues that the plaintiffs aren't receiving protections because they are gay, but because they aren't legally married, and they receive the same rights as all other non-married Montanans.

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy website] and the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-grous-file-lawsuits-challenging-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed separate federal lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text].  Last month, the US Department of Justice filed <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/doj-to-appeal-rulings-striking-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">two notices of appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, defending DOMA.

Kroes spoke following a four-month fact-finding period on net neutrality, a concept by which the open flow of information over the Internet is protected regardless of the amount of revenue generated by accessing the information. She stressed that maintaining the competitive nature of the European telecommunications market, transparency of service plans and ability to readily change between providers are all crucial to ensuring universal access to the Internet. According to Kroes, additional legislation might compromise the telecommunication industry's growth, though may be considered should current laws fail to sufficiently protect consumers. Such regulations may be implemented in the event that operators attempt to artificially spur sales by reducing services in basic packages or blocking access to particular web sites.

<p>Net neutrality remains a controversial issue. In the US, <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/senators-introduce-legislation-to-block-fcc-broadband-plan.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] in July intended to block the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The FCC opened a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services after the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in April that the commission lacks authority to require broadband providers to treat all Internet traffic equally. Telecommunications companies <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/content/verizonglobalhome/ghp_landing.aspx">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&#38;T</a> and <a href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites] argue that net neutrality would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tried and convicted <em>in absentia</em>, Bakri was reportedly surprised when his lawyer informed him of the verdict. He claims to have never received a summons or an arrest warrant. As Bakri lives openly in Tripoli, a city in the north of Lebanon, and appears regularly on television, it is not immediately clear why he was not arrested. Bakri maintains that the charges are fabricated and has refused to turn himself in.

<p>After living in the UK for 20 years, Bakri <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/uk-cleric-flees-to-lebanon-as-treason.php">fled to Lebanon</a> in 2005 after being named in an investigation by British authorities for <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/bombing-suspect-returned-to-uk-charges.php">allegedly making remarks in support of the London bombers</a> [JURIST reports]. Bakri also reportedly praised insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan while vowing not to inform authorities of any information he learned about future terrorist attacks. In 2005, he denied talking about the bombings and said he planed to return to London. While living in Britain, Bakri headed the now-dissolved Islamist group al-Muhajiroun.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

The eight accused men are all DRC policemen, but <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6AB0DY20101112">only five are currently before the court</a> [Reuters report], as three are still at-large. The eight men face charges of abduction, assassination, terrorism and conspiracy. Cherbeya, a prominent rights activist and member of the activist group Voice of the Voiceless, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10223564">found dead in his own car</a> [BBC report] in June 2. Soon after Cherbeya's death, national <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dr-congo-suspends-police-chief-over-killing-of-rights-activist.php">police chief John Numbi was suspended</a> [JURIST report], and the eight accused men were arrested. Numbi does not face charges in Cherbeya's death, but members of Cherbeya's activist group are petitioning the DRC government to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11742201">move the case to a military court</a> [BBC report] with the rank to try him for Cherbeya's death.

<p>The alleged assassination of a prominent rights activist by law enforcement is merely the latest in the ongoing human rights issues facing the DRC.

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] for violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340---A000-.html">federal statute prohibiting torture</a> [text]. In his recently published <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/features/decision-points-by-george-w-bush/?ref=homepage_banner_DecisionPoints">memoirs</a> [Random House summary], Bush admitted to authorizing the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] on suspects Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah, which the ACLU says has historically been prosecuted as a crime in the US. The letter also argues that failure to investigate Bush would harm the US's ability to advocate for human rights in other countries. Assistant US Attorney General John Durham is currently investigating the allegations that the US practiced torture during the Bush Era, but is not investigating the former president himself. The letter said:<blockquote>The ACLU acknowledges the significance of this request, but it bears emphasis that the former President's acknowledgement [sic] that he authorized torture is absolutely without parallel in American history. The admission cannot be ignored. In our system, no one is above the law or beyond its reach, not even a former president. That founding principle of our democracy would mean little if it were ignored with respect to those in whom the public most invests its trust. It would also be profoundly unfair for Mr. Durham to focus his inquiry on low-level officials charged with implementing official policy but to ignore the role of those who authorized or ordered the use of torture.</blockquote>The letter comes days after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] made a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/us-must-begin-criminal-investigation-torture-following-bush-admission-2010-11-10">similar declaration</a> [press release], saying that Bush's admissions "highlight once again the absence of accountability for the crimes under international law of torture and enforced disappearance committed by the USA."

<p>In July, former head of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> (OLC) [official website] and federal judge <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2981&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Jay Bybee</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/torture-memo-author-denies-authorizing-some-cia-interrogation-techniques.php">denied approving a number of interrogation techniques used by the CIA</a> [JURIST report]. Bybee was questioned by the committee in May in a closed-door hearing about controversial memos written by the OLC during the Bush administration, which asserted the legality of certain <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive]. The CIA subsequently used the enhanced interrogation techniques on prisoners at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] prison facility. According to Bybee, a number of the techniques, including repetitive waterboarding, extended isolation, the use of blackout goggles and daily beatings, were not authorized by the OLC memos. Bybee admitted to authorizing limited use of waterboarding when performed in a specific way, but he contended that the manner in which the CIA used the technique went beyond the recommendations made in the memos.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two witnesses, Ken Braziz Wekesa and William Kepkemboi Rono, claimed Tuesday that they were <a href = "http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1051352/-/item/1/-/mvq88b/-/index.html">bribed by the KNCHR</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em>], a government-funded human rights group, to testify to the ICC against Ruto, the former higher education minister.

The KNCHR also wants the police to arrest Wekesa and Rono and charge them with perjury. Although the two witnesses gave statements to the ICC, they were not slated to testify at the tribunal. The ICC announced a month ago that it would <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/icc-to-present-cases-against-instigators-of-kenya-post-election-violence.php">present two cases</a> against the six individuals most responsible for causing the post-election violence, down from the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/icc-prosecutor-accuses-officials-in.php">initial 20 officials</a> [JURIST reports] the ICC prosecutor initially accused. It has not been revealed if Ruto will be among those charged, although he was implicated in the <a href = "http://www.knchr.org/dmdocuments/KNCHR%20doc.pdf">initial report on the violence</a> [text, PDF] compiled by the KNCHR.

<p>In September, a businessman <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-businessman-challenges-legality-of-icc-investigation.php">challenged the legality of the ICC investigation</a>, claiming it was made illegal by Kenya's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">recently ratified constitution</a> [JURIST reports]. However, Justice and Constitutional Affairs <a href = "http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/justice.htm">Minister Mutula Kilonzo</a> [official website], said the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-justice-minister-denies-challenge-to-icc-investigation.php">government supports the investigation</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/icc-grants-prosecutors-request-to.php">ICC began conducting an investigation</a> in March after the <a href = "/paperchase/2009/02/kenya-parliament-rejects-bills.php">Kenyan parliament rejected</a> [JURIST reports] conducting their own in February. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">Kenyan presidential election of 2007</a> [JURIST report] left at least 1,000 people dead and 500,000 displaced in Kenya after protests erupted from allegations that <a href = "http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] committed voter fraud.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/stamped_collins_complaint_sm.pdf">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-challenges-discriminatory-military-policy-cutting-half-separation-pay-honorably-dis">press release</a>] Wednesday over a US military policy that cuts the separation pay of honorably discharged gay and lesbian service members in half. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of all service members involuntarily discharged in the last six years who were otherwise eligible to receive full separation pay, but instead received only half as a result of the separation pay policy. In the complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website], the ACLU challenged the policy, which the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] adopted in 1991, two years before Congress enacted the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy"</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. The plaintiffs contend the pay policy discriminates against homosexuals because, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00001174----000-.html">federal law</a> [10 USC &#167; 1174], all service members are entitled to separation pay if they have been involuntarily discharged after completing at least six years of service. Joshua Block, staff attorney with the ACLU Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Project stated, "[b]y denying servicemen and women full separation pay, the military is needlessly compounding the discrimination perpetuated by 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell." The separation pay policy, unlike DADT, can be changed without congressional approval. 

<p>The Obama administration <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/US-response-10A465-11-10-10.pdf">filed a brief</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-not-to-block-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] Wednesday asking the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] not to rescind the stay preventing suspension of DADT. The filing is in response to a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DADT-10A465-vacate-application.pdf">petition filed last week</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-asks-supreme-court-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> [advocacy website] asking the court to overturn the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">indefinite extension</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-temporarily-blocks-suspension-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. The government asked the court not to interrupt the policy while it is being considered in lower courts. The filing noted that President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates oppose the policy, but also stressed their support for the repeal of the policy through legislative measures, citing the need for deliberation, advance planning and training before transitioning from the 17-year-old policy. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Johnstone Busingyi indicated that his decision was based on Ingabire's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/12/AR2010111202796.html">threat to state security</a> [AP report]. The ruling follows an appeal of Tuesday's decision to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/world/africa/27briefs-RWANDA.html">deny bail and hold Ingabire for 30 days</a> [AP report]. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has accused Rwanda of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/08/02/rwanda-attacks-freedom-expression-freedom-association-and-freedom-assembly-run-presi">silencing dissent leading up to the presidential elections</a> [HRW report] in August, which were marred by a series of attacks on outspoken government critics. In addition to Ingabire, Bernard Ntaganda, president of the opposition PS-Imberakuri party, was arrested in June and detained while awaiting trial. HRW has also called for an <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/20/rwanda-allow-independent-autopsy-opposition-politician">independent autopsy</a> [HRW report] of Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, vice president of the opposition Democratic Green Party, after his body was found in July with his head severed and unusual marks on his body.

<p>Ingabire has been subject to multiple arrests since returning to Rwanda in January after being exiled for 16 years. In October, Ingabire was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-over-terror-allegations.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of being involved in the formation of a terrorist organization. Ingabire was implicated, authorities say, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39669650">during investigations</a> [AP report] into the activities of Joseph Ntawangundi, an aid to Ingabire, who was accused of commanding a Hutu militia group operating in neighboring Congo. In April, Ingabire was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on accusations of denying the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">archive</a>]. Authorities cited Ingabire's <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iVrNFl32gefPf6AUc3CkpUb7Y9sA">call for the prosecution</a> [AFP report] of those who killed Hutus during the genocide, in which over 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slain, as evidence of her denial of the genocide. In May, Rwandan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] US lawyer and JURIST <a href="/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erlinder">news archive</a>] on charges of genocide denial while he was in Rwanda to prepare his defense of Ingabire.

The order reads in its entirety:"The application to vacate the stay entered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on November 1, 2010, presented to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court is denied. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this application." The Obama administration, which wishes to repeal DADT legislatively, asked the court to maintain the stay in a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/US-response-10A465-11-10-10.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/2010/11/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-not-to-block-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] filed with the Supreme Court Wednesday.

The Log Cabin Republicans <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/news_views/reading-room-back-up/log-cabin-republicans-34.html">expressed disappointment</a> [press release] with Friday's ruling:<blockquote>With the likelihood of Congress repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" fading with each passing day, judicial relief continues to be perhaps the most viable avenue for ending this unconstitutional policy. We and Log Cabin Republicans will continue to fight on to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans who want to serve in our military without regard to their sexual orientation.</blockquote>The attorney said the group will ask the Ninth Circuit to expedite the government's appeal.

<p>Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">called on the 112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Gates issued a memorandum <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior Department of Defense officials. In September, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a US Air Force officer to be reinstated after being previously discharged under DADT.

The man, known only by the alias Xiao Wu, said that he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11741608">passed requisite academic tests and interviews</a> [BBC report] for the job but was denied after his health examination. He brought the suit against the <a href="http://202.205.177.9/edoas/en/">Education Ministry</a> [official website] in Anqing where the court ruled that the city education officials <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5g9FOa_KCyv8-KvBdixIXMHwYeG7A?docId=5110373">properly assessed</a> [CP report] his unsuitability for the position base on health standards. The man's lawyer said that he is only seeking the job he deserves, and he is already planning to appeal the ruling. There are about 740,000 Chinese people living with HIV/AIDs, and many face discrimination in education, employment and health care. 

<p>In June, the <a href="http://www.undp.org/">UN Development Programme</a> (UNDP), in coordination with the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/AboutUNAIDS/Secretariat/default.asp">UNAIDS Secretariat</a> [official websites], <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-launches-global-commission-on-hiv-and-the-law.php">launched the Global Commission on HIV and the Law</a> [JURIST report] in order to better understand the role played by the law in facilitating universal access to AIDS prevention and treatment. The commission also plans to address some of the most challenging HIV legal issues, including the criminalization of HIV/AIDS transmission and behavioral practices such as drug use and sexual activity. China has struggled to deal with the HIV/AIDs problem. In April, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/china-lifts-hivaids-entry-ban.php">lifted a ban on entry into the country</a> [JURIST report] for individuals with HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. In 2006, China responded to the growing numbers of those afflicted with the disease and<a href="/paperchase/2006/02/china-bans-discrimination-against.php"> issued it first guidelines</a> [JURIST report] on HIV/AIDS, banning discrimination against those infected by the virus and providing for free treatment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Though the government reiterated its concerns about several of the declaration's provisions, it <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/indig-autoch/un_declaration_nov2010_onu.aspx?lang=eng">cited</a> [statement] encouragement from community leaders and other countries' experiences in reversing its position on the document.  The Canadian government described the move as one intended to strengthen relationships with indigenous communities, saying:<blockquote>The Declaration is an aspirational document which speaks to the individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples, taking into account their specific cultural, social and economic circumstances.  Although the Declaration is a non-legally binding document that does not reflect customary international law nor change Canadian laws, our endorsement gives us the opportunity to reiterate our commitment to continue working in partnership with Aboriginal peoples in creating a better Canada.</blockquote><a href="http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=487">Shawn A-in-chut Atleo</a> [official profile], National Chief of the <a href="http://www.afn.ca">Assembly of First Nations</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.afn.ca/cmslib/general/10-11-12%20UND%20press%20release_Fe%20(2).pdf">praised</a> [press release] the endorsement, saying that the occasion marks "a new era of fairness and justice."

<p>The declaration was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/un-adopts-treaty-supporting-rights-of.php">adopted by the UN</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 after 143 member states voted to adopt the treaty, though Canada was among four&#45;including Australia, New Zealand and the US&#45;that declined to do so at the time.  The four originally cited concerns that it conflicted with their countries' own laws, among other contentions.  New Zealand <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hbAWKRaeXVh9Xa6u2AMYKA8ci2EQ">endorsed</a> [AFP report] the declaration in April, as <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/australia-endorses-un-declaration-on.php">did</a> [JURIST report] Australia in 2009.  The declaration seeks to negate past wrongs to indigenous people worldwide by ensuring equal enjoyment of the laws in each member nation and by prohibiting state sanctioned racial discrimination, forced removal from native lands, and forced assimilation into mainstream national culture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/11/150872.htm">hailed</a> [press release] Suu Kyi's release from "unjustified detention," while UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] offered similar praise and encouraged the country to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4924">release all political prisoners</a> [press release].  Both statements stressed the importance of ensuring that her release is unconditional, and her lawyers have indicated that any attempts to impose conditions are unacceptable.  Suu Kyi's release comes days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest.  Though the challenge was originally scheduled to be heard in October, the court waited until after Sunday's <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to issue its ruling.  The elections were the first held in the country in 20 years, and have received heavy international criticism.  It is anticipated that Suu Kyi will <a href="http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=20040">assist in a challenge</a> [AP report] against the election results in which the ruling party maintained its hold on power.

<p>Suu Kyi was prohibited from participating in the election under current Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">election laws</a> [JURIST report].  In October, Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/suu-kyi-files-challenge-to-myanmar-dissolution-of-opposition-party.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court challenging the dissolution of the <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website].  In June, an independent UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-release-of-suu-kyi.php">called for the release</a> [JURIST report] of Suu Kyi and other political prisoners in Myanmar, claiming their continued detention "contravenes international human rights law and casts a long shadow over planned elections in the country."  Suu Kyi originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/suu-kyi-files-suit-in-myanmar-to-stop.php">challenged the election law</a> [JURIST report] dissolving the NLD in April, but her suit was rejected.  In March, the NLD <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-opposition-party-boycotting.php">announced</a> that it would not take part in the elections after the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-high-court-rejects-suu-kyi.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] a lawsuit brought by the NLD to repeal the election laws preventing Suu Kyi from participating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an interview published Friday by the Lebanese Newspaper <a href="http://www.annahar.com/index.php?type=main&table=main&day=Sat">An-Nahar</a> [official website], Clinton reiterated US support for Lebanon and noted that the work of the STL is "legitimate and necessary." She also stressed the independence of the tribunal and that "no one knows what the Special Tribunal is going to do, who it might indict, or when it might choose to move forward." Clinton's interview followed remarks made Thursday by Hezbollah leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile], who said <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101112/ap_on_re_mi_ea/lebanon_hariri_tribunal">he would "cut off the hands"</a> [AP report] of any person attempting to arrest a Hezbollah member in connection with the murder. Last month, Nasrallah called for all Lebanese to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/hezbollah-leader-calls-for-boycott-of-un-backed-lebanon-tribunal.php">boycott the STL</a> [JURIST report] after information surfaced suggesting that the tribunal is set to implicate members of Hezbollah as participants in the assassination of Hariri.

<p>Earlier this month, STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/lebanon-tribunal-rejects-motions-to-disqualify-judges-for-bias.php">rejected two motions</a> [JURIST report] requesting the disqualification of judges on the grounds of bias. Judge Antonio Cassese denied the motions filed by Lebanese General Jamil El-Sayed, determining that El-Sayed failed to provide convincing evidence that judges <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/counsel/20101020_OTP-AC-2010-01_Counsel_Submission_2_En%20Translation.pdf">Afif Chamseddine</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/President/CH-PRESS-2010-09_President%2020101105.pdf">judgment</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/counsel/20101103_OTP-AC-2010-01_Counsel_Submission_EN%20translation.pdf">Ralph Riachy</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/President/CH-PRES-2010-08_President%2020101105.pdf">judgment</a>, PDF] are biased. El-Sayed had argued that, because the judges were nominated by the government of Lebanon, which was subsequently "condemned" by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, they were biased or at least appeared biased. In August, Hezbollah officials submitted evidence to the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">linking Israel to Hariri's death</a> in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">request by the tribunal</a> [JURIST reports] to turn over all information relating to the assassination.<br />
The STL is expected <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/11/08/Hariri-tribunal-overturns-challenge/UPI-68331289232340/">to issue indictments</a> [UPI report], possibly in December. The STL was created at the request of Lebanon's government to investigate Hariri's murder and began its work in 2007.  <br />

On Thursday, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/azerbaijan-court-partially-overturns-journalists-convictions.php">vacated Fatullayev's convictions</a> [JURIST report] for defamation and the incitement of terror and ethnic hatred. The court also ruled that his sentence for tax evasion had been served. The ruling came one month after the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/europe-rights-court-orders-immediate.php">affirmed its prior decision</a> [JURIST report] ordering Fatullayev's release because his convictions and eight-and-a-half-year prison sentence contravened Article 10, Freedom of Speech and Information, and Article 6, Right to a Fair Trial, of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The Supreme Court refused to order his release, however, finding that the ECHR order, which is binding on member states, did not apply to a two-and-a-half-year drug sentence handed down in July. In calling for his release, HRW explained:<blockquote>The authorities are maneuvering to make it look like they have complied with the European Court's judgment, but no one is fooled. It's clear that they are continuing to silence a journalist who has already served more than two years on a wrongful conviction.</blockquote>The rights organization went on to describe Fatullayev's case as one in a series of attacks on freedom of expression in Azerbaijan. 

<p>In 2009, Fatullayev received, <em>in absentia</em>, one of Committee to Project Journalist's (CPJ) prestigious <a href="http://cpj.org/awards/2009/ipfa-2009-awardees.php">International Press Freedom Award</a> [press release] and Amnesty International's Award for Journalism Under Threat. Fatullayev, who was editor-in-chief of the Realny Azerbaijan and Gundalik Azerbaijan newspapers until his imprisonment, formerly worked with well-known Azeri journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315439.stm">Elmar Huseynov</a> [BBC backgrounder] on the Monitor magazine until Huseynov was murdered in 2005. CPJ reported recently that Fatuallyev's imprisonment could be related to his <a href="http://cpj.org/reports/2008/09/azerbaijan-elmar.php">attempts to solve</a> [CPJ report] his colleague's murder. Azerbaijan's incumbent president Ilham Aliyev has been accused by members of the press of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/trial-begins-for-azerbaijan-journalists.php">repression of the media</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI described <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">Suu Kyi's release</a> [JURIST report] as "welcome," but emphasized that there are still an estimated 2,200 political prisoners held in Myanmar, the majority of which remain imprisoned for the exercise of the rights to peaceful assembly, expression and association. According to the rights group, these prisoners are being held in "deplorable conditions," which include inadequate food, sanitation and medical treatment, in addition to the use of torture by Myanmar authorities. AI explained:<blockquote>While Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release is certainly welcome, it only marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended, and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities. ... It is high time the government of Myanmar put an end to the ongoing injustice of political imprisonment in the country, while the international community-including China, India, ASEAN and the UN-must act together to prevent Myanmar from abusing its legal system to penalize peaceful opponents.</blockquote>The rights group went on to claim that these prisoners have also been moved to remote locations, restricting access to family and legal assistance, and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [advocacy website] has been denied access to them since 2005.

<p>AI's statement mirrors one <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-group-urges-myanmar-to-free-political-prisoners-before-election.php">released in September</a> [JURIST report], urging Myanmar to release all political prisoners ahead of the nation's November elections&#8212;the first to be held in 20 years. AI's statement marked the third anniversary of the violent government crackdown on activism in response to the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-inside-the-saffron-revolution-403645.html">Saffron Revolution</a> [<em>Independent</em> backgrounder], a peaceful pro-democracy movement led by Buddhist monks. According to AI, these prisoners "constitute a significant part of the political opposition." Suu Kyi was released Saturday, days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest. Though the challenge was originally scheduled to be heard in October, the court waited until after the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to issue its ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the basic unity agreement outlined by Iraqi lawmakers, the country's three major governmental positions will be headed by representatives from the Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite parties, but specific details on how the new national government will run have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/11/13/iraq.politics/index.html">yet to be decided</a> [CNN report] and must be approved separately in later parliamentary sessions. The deal was not reached without its complications as members of Sunni minority leader Allawi's alliance on Thursday <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/world/middleeast/12iraq.html?src=me">walked out of early sessions in protest</a> [NYT report], but returned to finalize the agreement. According to the basic terms of the deal, a new governmental office, the National Council for Strategic Policies, will be created and led by Allawi as a check on the prime minister's power. The new agreement marked a significant step for the Iraqi government after months of political unrest following the March <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/special/misc/iraqielections2010/">Parliamentary Elections</a> [CEIP backgrounder; JURIST <a href="currentawareness">news archive</a>]. US President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/12/press-conference-president-after-g20-meetings-seoul-korea">praised the agreement</a> [official statement], calling it a "milestone" in the history of modern Iraq:<blockquote>For the last several months, the United States has worked closely with our Iraqi partners to promote a broad-based government, one whose leaders share a commitment to serving all Iraqis as equal citizens. Now, Iraq's leaders must finish the job of forming their government so that they can meet the challenges that a diverse coalition will inevitably face. And going forward, we will support the Iraqi people as they strengthen their democracy, resolve political disputes, resettle those displaced by war, and build ties of commerce and cooperation with the United States, the region and the world.</blockquote>It is unclear whether Allawi will accept the governmental position offered to him, after stating that he would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/11/12/iraq.allawi/index.html?iref=allsearch">refuse to participate</a> [CNN report] in the new government and questioning the intentions of Iraqi lawmakers. Allawi did not attend Saturday's parliamentary session.

<p>Despite uncertainty over the future of Iraq's national government, the new power-sharing agreement is a breakthrough for Iraqi lawmakers. Last month, the Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that the seven-month delay in forming a government following the March parliamentary elections was unconstitutional, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-high-court-rules-delay-in-government-formation-unconstitutional.php">ordering parliament to reconvene</a> [JURIST report]. In August, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for Iraq's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-sense-of-urgency-in-forming-iraq-government.php">political leaders to work together</a> [JURIST report] "with a higher sense of urgency" to form a new government, warning that further delays could create more instability. Ban expressed the concern that the delay could lead to a "growing sense of uncertainty in the country" and prevent the parliament from addressing pressing domestic issues, including Arab-Kurdish disputed areas revenue-sharing, the adoption of legislation related to hydrocarbons, relations among the federal and regional governments, the constitutional review process and the strengthening of institutions of governance and the rule of law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In places like China, which enforces compliance with strict censorship laws before an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license will be issued, this means that Google must comply with censorship regulations or discontinue operations in the world's largest Internet market. Instead, Google urges policy makers to develop an agenda that recognizes the barrier Internet restriction poses to international trade and to reform Internet policy in a way that is consistent with the <a href="http://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/26-gats.pdf">General Agreement on Trade in Services</a> [text, PDF]:<blockquote>Given the tremendous stakes involved, policymakers must develop and aggressively implement a proactive agenda that aligns Internet policy with the core principles of international trade. First, governments should not treat Internet policy and international trade as stand-alone silos, and recognize that many Internet censorship-related actions are unfair trade barriers. Second, governments should object to measures that affect information flow and that are insufficiently transparent, unreasonably administered, biased in favor of domestic players, or inconsistent with countries' WTO market access commitments, and consider appropriate trade actions. Third, governments should negotiate new trade disciplines that reflect the growing role of Internet-related trade in the global economy, to provide even stronger tools to combat measures that restrict information flow and the Internet.</blockquote> Google hopes that these issues will be brought forward at the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dda_e/dda_e.htm">Doha Development Agenda round of WTO negotiations</a> [official website]. 

<p>In July, a Chinese government official said that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/google-agreed-to-follow-chinese-censorship-laws-official.php">Google had agreed to follow Chinese censorship laws</a> [JURIST report] to gain a license renewal that would still prevent users from accessing sites that threatened national security, while not requiring Google to censor its China or Hong Kong based websites. This <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-to-stop-redirecting-china-users-to-unfiltered-hong-kong-search-engine.php">agreement was reached</a> [JURIST report] in June after a dispute concerning Google's practice of redirecting mainland users to the Hong Kong-based website as a means of working around censorship laws. China responded by <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">reiterating its commitment to open Internet</a> [JURIST report], but stressing that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. In February, China issued new regulations <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">tightening restrictions on Internet use</a> [JURIST report] by requiring citizens operating websites to submit identity cards and meet with regulators before their sites can be registered. The new policies came amid negotiations with Google regarding the Internet company's January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">threat to discontinue operations in China</a> [JURIST report] due to the country's overarching Internet censorship. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The prisoner, Arnoldo Ramos Lauzurique, was one of 52 prisoners captured as part of a 2003 tightening on dissent within the country. Of those 52 individuals, 39 agreed to go into exile in Spain. Ramos, however, is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/11/13/1925123/cuba-frees-the-first-of-13-political.html">one of 13 dissidents who refused to take the deal</a> [AP report], therefore delaying his release. Last week, the advocacy group <a href="http://www.damasdeblanco.com/">Ladies in White</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish] composed of the wives of imprisoned dissidents, petitioned <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/biography/documents/hf_ben-xvi_bio_20050419_short-biography_en.html">Pope Benedict XVI</a> [official profile] for the release of the 13 prisoners as the four-month deadline agreed by the government expired, although <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AC2FP20101114">no specific date</a> [Reuters report] of release was given. Another of the prisoners, Luis Enrique Ferrer, is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/11/14/cuba.dissident.release/">set to be released soon</a> [CNN report], but, unlike Ramos, will go into exile in Spain. The Cuban government has also agreed to release 14 more prisoners in addition to the original 52.   

<p>Cuba continues to face criticism for its human rights record, and the government's actions have resulted in notoriety for a number of activists. In October, dissident Guillermo Farinas was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/cuba-activist-awarded-top-eu-human-rights-prize.php">awarded the Sakharov Prize</a> [JURIST report], given to those who work for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In March, Amnesty International called on Cuba to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-revoke-laws.php">revoke laws that restrict freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report]. However despite Cuba's record, reports indicated that, in 2008, the number of political prisoners in Cuba had declined from 234 to 205, although the number of brief detentions had increased, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-reports-decline-in-number.php">report</a> [JURIST report] issued by the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation in February 2009. The same report also charged that the decline in the number of political prisoners was due to the new practice of imposing shorter prison terms for those arrested employed since 2003.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its report, entitled "Open Secret: Mounting Evidence of Europe's Complicity in Rendition and Secret Detention," AI said that limited progress has been made in holding governments accountable, mostly as a result of mounting evidence of certain states' involvement in activities, including hosting secret prisons, allowing the US to use their territories for abduction and rendition, and interrogating individuals under torture. AI said that further progress toward genuine accountability, achieved by bringing perpetrators to justice and providing redress for victims, is most often impeded by the "need" for  "state secrecy" in order to protect national security. According to the report, however:<blockquote>European governments have an opportunity now to recommit to a human rights machinery at the national level that works to end impunity, not perpetuate it. The fact that European states colluded in such egregious violations - illegal transfers, secret detention, and torture and ill- treatment; crimes under international law, in fact - is sobering.</blockquote> The report concludes with AI stating that, while states hold a duty to protect their populations from violent attack, Europe should not be turned into an "accountability-free zone."

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/europe-rights-court-to-review-macedonia-role-in-cia-extraordinary-rendition.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would review the involvement of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the extraordinary rendition and torture of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=masri">Khaled El-Masri</a> [JURIST news archive] by the CIA. In 2003, on orders from the US, Macedonian authorities seized El-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent, while he was traveling in Macedonia and held him incommunicado for 23 days. He was then handed over to the CIA and transported to a secret detention facility in Afghanistan where he was held for four months in allegedly inhumane conditions, interrogated and abused. In September, Polish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would investigate the alleged mistreatment of accused <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uss+cole">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] bomber Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri at a secret CIA prison in Poland. The investigation was in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/lawyers-for-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-request-investigation-into-detention-in-poland.php">request</a> [JURIST report] filed by human rights group <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] and al-Nashiri's lawyers. The request asked prosecutors to scrutinize al-Nashiri's detention and treatment as part of their <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the allegations of a CIA-operated secret prison in the country and to prosecute those responsible for the acts on Polish soil.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 600-page report describes the actions of the DOJ's Office of Special Investigations (OSI), created in 1979 to deport Nazis, and documents cases of Nazis who were aided by US officials. According to the report, Nazi persecutors gained entry to the US even though government officials were aware of their backgrounds. Senior DOJ lawyer Mark Richard, responsible for editing the final version, convinced then-attorney general <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=77">Janet Reno</a> [official profile] to commission the report in 1999. Although Richard urged senior officials to make the report public until his death, the DOJ has resisted releasing the report since 2006. Director of the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/index.html">National Security Archive</a> [official website] Tom Blanton, said:<blockquote>Embarrassment suffered by public officials is the price they pay for public power. It goes with the territory, but here, their coverup is not nearly as bad as the crime, which was to shelter Nazi war criminals in the name of national security. This the public needs to know and has a right to know.</blockquote> In November 2009, the National Security Archive <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/index.htm">submitted</a> [press release] a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552 text] <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/foia_20091007.pdf">request</a> [text, PDF] for the history of the OSI. The DOJ <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/doj_denial_20091118.pdf">denied the request</a> [text, PDF] on the grounds that the report fell under exemptions to the FOIA as it was a deliberative and pre-decisional document that was never finalized or approved by the assistant attorney general. The National Security Archive <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/appeal_20100113.pdf">appealed</a> [text, PDF] the decision and, in May 2010, subsequently <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website]. Under the threat of a lawsuit, the DOJ then released a <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/OSI_report_interim_release.pdf">redacted version</a> [text, PDF] of the document.

<p>While more than 300 Nazi persecutors have been deported, stripped of citizenship or denied entry to the US since the creation of the OSI, the Holocaust continues to affect today's legal world. In May, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] charges against alleged Nazi war criminal <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>]. A year earlier, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied an application for stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report] filed by Demjanjuk, who faces 27,900 accessory accounts stemming from his alleged involvement as a guard at <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor</a> [Death Camps backgrounder] concentration camp. Also this May, the DOJ announced that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/sibpages/phi/phimain.htm">Philadelphia Immigration Court</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-immigration-court-orders-deportation-of-ex-nazi-guard-to-austria.php">ordered the deportation</a> [JURIST report] of former SS guard Anton Geiser to Austria for serving as an armed guard at the Sachsenhausen and the Buchenwald concentration camps during World War II. In April, the Regensburg District Court in southern Germany <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-court-convicts-uk-bishop-for.php">convicted British Bishop Richard Williamson</a> [JURIST report] of incitement for denying the Holocaust and ordered him to pay a 10,000 euro fine. In March, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-court-sentences-former-nazi-to.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Nazi SS member Heinrich Boere to life in prison for the 1944 murders of three Dutch civilians. In August, a German district court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-court-convicts-nazi-officer-of.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Nazi army officer Josef Scheungraber to life in prison for the 1944 reprisal killing of 10 Italian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that, in construing a federal statute imposing mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking crimes committed with guns, the minimum sentence contained in the statute applies unless another statute imposes a longer minimum sentence for the weapons charge. Defendants argued that their respective 15- and 20-year prison sentences were not dictated by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.shtml">18 USC &#167; 924(c)</a> [text], which provides that "any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm" shall be sentenced to no less than five years in prison in addition to any sentence for the underlying crime. Both defendants received five-year extensions to their additional sentences of 10 and 15 years for carrying guns while committing crimes involving drug trafficking. They argued that the trial courts failed to apply the "except" clause of &#167; 924(c), which makes the provision applicable, "[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law." The defendants argued that the "except" clause should apply if any of the charges on which they were convicted or charges on which they were convicted stemming from the criminal transaction carried a longer minimum sentence. The court, rejecting that argument, agreed with the government that the "except" clause applies only "if another provision of the United States Code mandates a punishment for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime or crime of violence, and that minimum sentence is longer than the punishment applicable under &#167; 924(c)." The court explained:<blockquote>We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a &#167; 924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction. Under the "except" clause as we comprehend it, a &#167; 924(c) offender is not subject to stacked sentences for violating &#167; 924(c). If he possessed, brandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty would be 10 years, not 22. He is, however, subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in &#167; 924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by &#167; 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.</blockquote>The court noted that Congress passed the current version of &#167; 924(c) to increase penalties for crimes committed with guns and that the defendants' construction of the law would decrease sentences compared to the previous version of the statute. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case.

<p>The court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-479.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-opens-october-2010-term-with-arguments-on-bankruptcy-sentencing.php">report</a>] in October when it opened its current session. In July 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], held, in an <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/08/08-10857.0.wpd.pdf">unpublished opinion</a> [text, PDF], that the trial court properly applied &#167; 924(c) to Carlos Gould who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and possession and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. In February 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/081623p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the trial court correctly applied &#167; 924(c) in sentencing Kevin Abbot to twenty years in prison after police arrested him during a 2004 raid on an abandoned property that contained drugs, drug paraphernalia and two handguns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-11556.htm">Tolentino v. New York</a> [docket], the court will determine whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/exclusionary_rule">exclusionary rule</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] prohibits police from using a defendant's driving record compiled by the state's Department of Motor Vehicles obtained after illegally stopping the defendant. The <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/CTAPPS/">Court of Appeals of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/CTAPPS/decisions/2010/mar10/37opn10.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the exclusionary rule does not bar police from using evidence that a driver had his license suspended 10 previous times after police allegedly illegally stopped the vehicle. Relying heavily on <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/468/1032/case.html">INS v. Lopez Mendoza</a> [opinion text], the court reasoned that since a defendant's identity is never subject to exclusion, information obtained only through learning his identity, such as his driving record, is not subject to exclusion either.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-5443.htm">Fowler v. United States</a> [docket], the court will determine the federal nexus required to convict a defendant under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1512.html">18 USC &#167; 1512(a)(1)(C)</a> [text], which prohibits killing or attempting to kill a person with the intent to "prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense or a violation of conditions of probation, parole, or release pending judicial proceedings." The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200815463.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Charles Fowler violated the statute by killing a police officer who had stopped Fowler and his accomplices who were planning a bank robbery in a stolen vehicle containing drugs and who had recently committed an interstate robbery. Fowler protested that prosecutors failed to establish that it was likely the officer would transfer information to federal investigators or that it was likely that a federal investigation would be opened. The court held, however, that prosecutors need only establish that the defendant killed the victim to prevent the communication of a possible federal offense and that they had met that burden.</p>

<p>Also Monday, the court refused to dismiss the <em>writ of certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1272.htm">Kentucky v. King</a> [docket, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1272.htm">cert. petition</a>, PDF] as improvidently granted. The court will determine when lawful police action impermissibly "creates" exigent circumstances that preclude warrantless arrest. The case was appealed from the <a href="http://courts.ky.gov/supremecourt/default.htm">Supreme Court of Kentucky</a>  [official website] to determine which of the five tests currently being used by US circuit courts should be used to determine this issue. The Kentucky court <a href="http://courts.ky.gov/supremecourt/default.htm">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the officers were not in hot pursuit of a fleeing criminal and, therefore, the exigent circumstances used to validate the warrantless arrest were self-created. The court originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in September, and the respondent had sought a dismissal because the charges against him were dropped since review was granted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They are accused of participating in the murder of more than 800 Bosnian Muslims during the massacre.

Bakri also reportedly praised insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan while vowing not to inform authorities of any information he learned about future terrorist attacks.

Justice Ming Chin, writing for the majority, held that &#167; 68130.5(a) does not violate Federal Immigration law due to the fact that the exemption is not based on formal legal residency:<blockquote>Because the exemption is given to all who have attended high school in California for at least three years (and meet the other requirements), and not all who have done so qualify as California residents for purposes of in-state tuition, and further because not all unlawful aliens who would qualify as residents but for their unlawful status are eligible for the exemption, we conclude the exemption is not based on residence in California. Rather, it is based on other criteria. Accordingly, section 68130.5 does not violate section 1623.</blockquote>Illegal immigrants will remain ineligible to receive state or federal financial aid benefits. Kris Kobach, counsel for IRLI says he will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AF0U420101116">appeal the case</a> [Reuters report] to the Supreme Court. 

<p>The IRLI lawsuit was one among many immigration suits currently pending across the country. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">denied</a> motions to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the constitutionality of the controversial Arizona <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Under the law, it is designated a crime to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500. In September, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that two ordinances passed by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, making it more difficult for illegal immigrants to live or work in the town are <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted Monday to ban animal cruelty or crush videos, revising the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">1999 legislation</a> [18 USC &#167; 48 text] that was struck down by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=US+Supreme+Court">news archive</a>] in April. The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h5566ih.txt.pdf">Prevention of Interstate Commerce in Animal Crush Videos Act of 2010</a> [HR 5566 text, PDF] maintains that creating, selling or distributing animal crush videos, which feature small animals being tortured or killed, is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison.The revised legislation more narrowly defines what constitutes a crush video, excluding videos depicting "customary and normal veterinary or agricultural husbandry practices," as well as videos of hunting, fishing or trapping. Originally passed by the House in July, the Act slightly alters the language approved by the Senate in September and will now go back for reconsideration. 

<p>The House was forced to revise the Act following the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">United States v. Stevens</span>, in which the 1999 law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] for being substantially overbroad and therefore in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. Legislators hope that the new amendments to the law will afford it greater enforceability and staying power in their efforts to ban crush videos. Following the Supreme Court's decision, animal rights activists <a href="/hotline/2010/04/stevens-opinion-contains-seeds-of.php">focused</a> on the <a href="/hotline/2010/04/in-wake-of-stevens-decision-congress.php">narrowness</a> of the ruling, as well as the dissent, and <a href="/hotline/2010/04/stevens-court-left-open-issue-of.php">called on</a> [JURIST comments] Congress to revise the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Thai <a href="http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/">Cabinet</a> [official website, in Thai] <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/206678/viktor-bout-extradited-to-us">approved the extradition</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] and handed Bout over to US law enforcement officials for immediate departure to the US. Bout has been fighting extradition since 2008 when he was arrested and accused of running an arms trafficking network in South America, Africa and Afghanistan. Upon arrival in the US, Bout faces charges stemming from a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/states/newsrel/nyc050608_indictment.pdf">2008 indictment</a> [text, PDF] for selling weapons to a terrorist group and conspiring to kill US nationals. The Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/2a047880dbc20a8ec32577dd004d304d?OpenDocument">opposes the extradition</a> [press release], claiming political motivation fueled the Thai government's decision:<blockquote>There is no doubt that the illegal extradition of Viktor Bout is a consequence of the unprecedented political pressure exerted by the United States on the government and judicial authorities in Thailand. All this can only be characterized as interference in the administration of justice and calls into question the independence of Thailand's judicial system and of decision making by the Thai authorities.</blockquote>The Russian government maintains that Bout is innocent. If convicted in the US, Bout faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

<p>In October, the Bangkok Criminal Court paved the way for Bout's extradition to the US when it <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/thailand-court-dismisses-charges-against-suspected-russia-arms-dealer.php">dismissed money laundering and fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] against him. In an attempt to avoid extradition to the US, Bout <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/accused-russia-arms-dealer-appeals-us-extradition-in-thailand-court.php">appealed the decision</a> [JURIST report], requesting that the charges be reinstated. In August, a Thai appeals court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-court-approves-us-extradition-of-suspected-russia-arms-dealer.php">Bout must be extradited</a> [JURIST report] to the US within three months or be released from Thai custody. The court's decision overturned a ruling by the Bangkok Criminal Court in August 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/thailand-court-refuses-extradition-to.php">refusing to extradite Bout</a> [JURIST report] on the basis that the accusations made by the US were not cognizable under Thai law. Bout has been in Thai custody since he was <a href="http://www.interpol.int/public/ICPO/PressReleases/PR2008/PR200810.asp">arrested</a> [Interpol press release] in a joint operation carried out by US and Thai authorities in which Bout allegedly sought to sell arms to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9272/farc_eln.html">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [CFR backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ffrf.org/">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website], its members Jan and Pat Doe, and their three children, who are students at New Hampshire public schools, brought the lawsuit against the US government, the Hanover and Dresden school districts and the School Administrative Unit. The suit challenged the 2002 <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XV/194/194-15-c.htm">New Hampshire School Patriot Act</a> [text], which requires schools to authorize a time during the day for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. FFRF claims that the recitation of the pledge in New Hampshire's public schools violates the Establishment Clause, Free Exercise Clause, Equal Protection Clause,p and Due Process Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">US Constitution</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], as well as the New Hampshire Constitution and federal and state law. Upholding the law, Chief Judge Sandra Lynch wrote:<blockquote>In reciting the Pledge, students promise fidelity to our flag and our nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church. The New Hampshire School Patriot Act's primary effect is not the advancement of religion, but the advancement of patriotism through a pledge to the flag as a symbol of the nation.</blockquote>The appeals court's ruling affirms a 2009 district court ruling. Plaintiffs were represented by atheist <a href="/currentawareness/newdow.php">Michael Newdow</a> [JURIST news archive], who <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/11/15/court_upholds_nh_law_allowing_pledge_in_school/">plans to request a rehearing</a> [AP report] by the full First Circuit.

<p>Other federal courts have also upheld similar state laws. In October, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-court-rules-texas-pledge-of-allegiance-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the words "one state under God" in the Texas Pledge of Allegiance do not violate the First Amendment.

<p>The British government has not shied away from the Guantanamo Bay controversy, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/uk-to-launch-investigation-into-torture-allegations.php">launching an investigation into torture allegations</a> in May, as well as ruling that state intelligence agencies <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">cannot use secret evidence</a> [JURIST reports] in their defense against abuse.

The motion came after an anonymous juror's note was read in court, indicating that the juror was alone in her views and was being <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/nyregion/16ghailani.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">attacked for her conclusions</a> [NYT report]. The juror requested to be removed or replaced. The note came on the third day of deliberations in the high-profile case, which is the first of the Obama administration's attempts to try <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-ghailani-trial-20101116,0,3627585.story">prominent terror suspects in federal court</a> [LAT report]. Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the juror's request and instructed the jury to continue their deliberations. In denying the motion, Kaplan noted that it was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-15/embassy-bombing-juror-feels-attacked-over-views-must-keep-deliberating.html">unrealistic to expect a unanimous verdict so soon</a> [Bloomberg report] given the size of the trial record, which has swelled to 2,200 pages with hundreds of pieces of evidence. 

<p>Ghailani faces charges for his alleged involvement in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombings of US embassies</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=embassy+kenya+tanzania">news archive</a>] in Tanzania and Kenya. The trial began in October with <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-court-hears-opening-statements-in-ex-guantanamo-detainees-civilian-trial.php">opening statements</a>, following a delay when Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-bars-key-witness-in-trial-of-ex-guantanamo-detainee.php">barred key US government witness</a> [JURIST reports] Hussein Abebe from testifying. In July, Kaplan ruled that Ahmed Ghailani is not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-rules-former-guantanamo-detainee-fit-to-stand-trial.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. In June, Kaplan denied a request from Ghailani to be exempt from prison strip searches, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-subject-to-strip-search.php">citing security concerns</a> [JURIST report]. In May, Kaplan refused to dismiss criminal charges against Ghailani despite claims that he had been tortured in prison. Kaplan held that even if Ghailani was mistreated while in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] custody, there was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-drop-charges-against-exguantanamo-detainee.php">no connection between that and the current prosecution</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shaaban went missing from his hometown in Alexandria, Egypt, on November 7 and was found dead in a canal near where he lives on November 11. According to Ahmed Shaaban's family, his body was covered in bruises. They accuse police officers from Sidi Gaber police station of torturing and killing Shaaban. According to AI, the family received an anonymous phone call one day after Shaaban went missing saying they he was in custody at Sidi Gaber and being subjected to torture. "These disturbing allegations of enforced disappearance and death in custody, and possibly unlawful killing by police, must be immediately and fully investigated by an independent body," said Malcolm Smart, AI's director for the Middle East and North Africa.

However, reports have surfaced that Shaaban and his friend Ahmed Farraq Labib were <a href="http://www.egynews.net/wps/portal/news?params=106805">accused of stealing a mobile phone</a> [EGY News report, in Arabic] on the day that Shaaban went missing. Labib is currently in police custody at Sidi Gaber.  

<p>Sidi Gaber police officers are also currently under investigation for another incident in which a man was dragged out of a cafe and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/06/24/egypt-prosecute-police-beating-death">publicly beat to death</a> [HRW report]. According to the US State Department's Human Rights Report for Egypt, in 2009, there were <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136067.htm">30 reported instances of torture in police custody</a> [report]. Egypt investigated some of these, and, in several of the cases, punished the responsible officers and made them pay compensation to the victims.

Shortly thereafter, Diallo, a Peul and the head of the <a href="http://ufdg2010.org">Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea</a> (UDFG) [party website, in French] <a href="http://ufdg2010.org/new/nos-communiques/declaration-de-l-alliance-cellou-dalein-president-relative-a-l-election-de-cellou-dalein-diallo-comme-president-de-la-republique">declared himself the winner</a> [press release, in French]. Now Diallo is alleging that the election was the result of "fraud on a massive scale" in the runoff, including "computer manipulation" of votes, ballot stuffing and systematic suppression and intimidation of ethnic Peuls in UDFG stronghold districts. UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon Monday urged the people of Guinea to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4927">accept the election results</a> [press release] and "resolve any differences through legal means." He also "call[ed] on the international community to provide Guinea with concrete support as the country embarks on a new phase towards peace, consolidation and development" and congratulated the nation on its first "peaceful, orderly" democratic transfer of power.

<p>November's election ended two years of military rule under a transitional government formed by military captain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who staged a coup in the wake of the death of former president <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/23/lansana-conte-profile">Lansana Conte</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], the nation's ruler for 24 years. In September, two Guinean election officials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guinea-officials-convicted-of-election-fraud.php">convicted of election fraud</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to a year in jail in connection with irregularities that arose in the June presidential primary election, one incident in a string of controversies responsible for multiple delays of the runoff, which was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/guineaNews/idAFLDE66K1LY20100721?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">initially scheduled for July</a> [Reuters report]. In May, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) sent a delegation from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) [official websites] to Guinea to<a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-prosecutors-investigating-2009-military-violence-in-guinea.php"> further investigate the killing</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280603.stm">more than 150 pro-democracy protesters in Conakry</a> [BBC backgrounder] in September 2009. The protesters had rallied against Camara, who announced in October that he intended to push elections forward three months and stand for election, breaking a promise not to run made shortly after he took power. Camara was ultimately forced into exile two months later after being shot in the head in an assassination attempt staged by one of his aides. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, which passed 261-103, eliminates the court's ability to examine the recent "crisis taxes" imposed on banks, energy companies, foreign retail and telecommunication firms. Once the law is signed by <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=28133">President Pal Schmitt</a> [EP profile], the court will only be able to invalidate tax and budget legislation if it infringes on  basic human rights like the right to privacy and the freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Critics argue that the legislation threatens democratic freedoms. The <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Hungarian Civic Party</a> (FIDESZ) [party website, in Hungarian] controlled legislature decided to restrict the power of the court after it issued a decision last month <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/index.php?id=2010__oktober_26">striking down a 98 percent retroactive tax</a> [press release, in Hungarian] on public severance payments.

<p>Hungary faces a growing budget deficit and is on the verge of a severe economic crisis. The National Assembly is currently debating the 2011 budget and adopted the series of unconventional taxes and budget policies in order to conform to the EU's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/deficit/index_en.htm">Excessive Deficit Procedure</a> for <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/deficit/countries/hungary_en.htm">Hungary</a> [materials]. The <a href="http://www.mkkt.hu/">Fiscal Council of Hungary</a> [official website, in Hungarian] forecasts that the "crisis taxes" [No. T/1374] are expected the <a href="http://www.mkkt.hu/download/000/319/T_1374_Special%20tax%20on%20certain%20sectors.pdf">increase budget revenues</a> [report, in Hungarian] and satisfy the Pay-As-You Go rule. Without the "crisis taxes" Hungary would not be able to meet next year's budget deficit target of less than 3 percent GDP. In 2007, the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/hungary-high-court-endorses-opposition.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a proposed referendum on unpopular economic reform proposals advanced by former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5360116.stm">Ferenc Gyurcsany</a> [BBC profile]. The high court ruling reversed a prior ruling by the <a href="http://www.valasztas.hu/en/03/3_0.html">National Election Committee</a> [official website], which barred the referendum on the grounds that it would have affected the budget in violation of Article 28C-5a of the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/hu00000_.html">Hungarian Constitution</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from an <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">April 7 incident</a> [JURIST report] in which police fired on a crowd of anti-government demonstrators, killing more than 85 people. The crowd eventually overwhelmed security forces, ultimately overtaking the Kyrgyz government and forcing Bakiyev into exile. Families of the victims held an <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-52973120101117?pageNumber=1">angry demonstration</a> [Reuters report] during the trial in the capital city of Bishkek, calling for the accused men to be punished. Human rights activists in the country have argued that the accused men will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11775467">not receive a fair trial</a> [BBC report] because of prevalent bias. Bakiyev, who now lives in Belarus and will be tried <em>in absentia</em>, maintains that police only shot at the protesters after the crowd began firing on Kyrgyz government headquarters. Kyrgyzstan's interim government, led by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile], <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Bakiyev with murder in April. Otunbayeva has <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring Bakiyev and other members of the former government to justice.

<p>The country's new parliament, elected last month amid ongoing unrest, <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/central/Kyrgyzstans-New-Parliament-Holds-First-Session-107029653.html">held its first assembly last week</a> [VOA report] and discussed the possibility of a coalition government. Last month's parliamentary elections were the first since a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">new constitution took effect</a> in July after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved by voters</a> [JURIST reports] in a nationwide referendum. In September, a court in Kyrgyzstan <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-president-issues-shoot-to-kill-order-as-ethnic-violence-continues.php">issued the first convictions</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the June 2010 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/14/kyrgyzstan-conflict-background">ethnic violence</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kyrgyzstan+violence">news archive</a>] against Uzbeks in primarily the southern cities of Osh and Jalal'abad. The conflict is believed to have been linked to Bakiyev's overthrow. In August, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/08/16/where-justice-0">reported</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-group-claims-kyrgyzstan-armed-forces-played-role-in-ethnic-clash.php">report</a>] that Kyrgyzstan armed forces played a role in instigating and at times taking part in the attacks against ethnic Uzbeks. The group called on the international community to ensure the effective and speedy deployment of an international police force and to support efforts for an international investigation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Aziz, who served in the government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saddam+hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive] as both the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-court-sentences-saddam-era-deputy-pm-aziz-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] last month by the Iraqi High Criminal Court. The sentence was rendered on charges that Aziz, while serving in his governmental roles, was involved in the persecution of various Iraqi religious parties. In the interview, in which Talabani also answered questions regarding the recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/iraq-parliament-approves-national-government-unity-agreement.php">formation of a new government</a> [JURIST report], he cited his political beliefs as the main justification underlying his refusal to sign the execution order. He stated, "I will not sign the order to execute Tariq Aziz, I cannot sign an order of this kind because I'm a socialist, I feel compassion for [him]."

<p>Aziz is currently serving a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">15-year sentence</a> [JURIST report], which is the result of a prior conviction in March 2009. However, the death sentence based on this most recent conviction cannot be carried out in the absence of the approval of the Presidency Council. </p>

<p>In July, the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-transfers-26-saddam-era-officials-to-iraqi-custody.php">transferred 26 Saddam-era Iraqi officials</a> [JURIST report], including Aziz, from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Camp+Cropper">Camp Cropper</a> [JURIST news archive] to the Iraqi-controlled Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad. That month, Aziz was also charged with additional crimes alleged to have occurred during Hussein's regime, with his lawyer contending that the current Iraqi government was attempting to find a reason to execute him. Aziz's family has called for his release on health grounds, based on claims he has had two heart attacks in addition to having <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/imprisoned-saddam-era-iraqi-foreign.php">suffered a stroke</a> [JURIST report] in January. In August 2009, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-court-convicts-top-saddam.php">convicted of forcing Kurdish displacement</a> [JURIST report] from northeast Iraq during the late 1980s, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Prior to his March conviction for the 1992 murders of 42 merchants accused of price-gouging during a period of UN-imposed sanctions, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the 1999 killing of protesters who rioted in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Myanmar's military government <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11474823">formally abolished</a> [BBC report] the NLD in May for failing to register for elections, which took place earlier this month. Suu Kyi had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/suu-kyi-files-challenge-to-myanmar-dissolution-of-opposition-party.php">filed an appeal</a> while under house arrest for the dissolution of her party under a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-election-laws.php">controversial election law</a> [JURIST reports]. Suu Kyi asked the court to annul the part of the election law that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">bars political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] from participating in elections and also to establish a parliament of lawmakers who won in the 1990 elections. Suu Kyi originally filed suit with the court in April, but her <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/suu-kyi-files-suit-in-myanmar-to-stop.php">claim was rejected</a> [JURIST report]. The dissolution was seen as political move by the military government in order to keep the NLD from participating in Myanmar's 2010 elections, the first in 20 years.

<p>Suu Kyi's visit to the High Court marked her first visit to Rangoon since the <a href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/ministry/home/MPFmain.htm">Myanmar Police Force</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">released</a> [JURIST report] her on Saturday after almost eight years of house arrest. Her release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest. Though the challenge was originally scheduled to be heard in October, the court waited until after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to issue its ruling. It is anticipated that Suu Kyi will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=20040">assist in a challenge</a> [AP report] against the election results in which the ruling party maintained its hold on power, but the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/8140269/Burma-regime-warns-Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-against-election-challenge.html">military government has warned</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] against any kind of action by the opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ocampo also said that the ICC is looking into <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hMiMnMdC71QRdqaK4EHhUUF-dUrQ?docId=5158815">additional claims</a> [CP report] of witness intimidation and bribery. While Ocampo did not name the politician in his report, the statement was most likely in reference to former Cabinet minster William Ruto. Last week, the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> (KNCHR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-rights-group-accuses-official-of-interfering-with-icc-election-investigation.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Ruto of interfering with the ICC investigation into the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">2007 post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive], denying accusations of bribing witnesses. Two witnesses, Ken Braziz Wekesa and William Kepkemboi Rono, claimed earlier that week that they were <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1051352/-/item/1/-/mvq88b/-/index.html">bribed by the KNCHR</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em>], a government-funded human rights group, to testify to the ICC against Ruto. Rono and Wekesa claimed they were bribed by KNCHR commissioner <a href="http://www.knchr.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=14">Hassan Omar Hassan</a> [KNCHR profile] with money, entry into safe houses and an eventual promise to be moved out of Kenya. The KNCHR, <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/We%20housed%20chaos%20witnesses,%20says%20KNCHR/-/1056/1052144/-/o2da1vz/-/index.html">admitting they housed the prospective witnesses</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em>], requested an investigation into Ruto's influence on the witnesses to change their testimonies. The KNCHR also wants the police to arrest Wekesa and Rono and charge them with perjury. Although the two witnesses gave statements to the ICC, they were not slated to testify at the tribunal. 

<p>The ICC announced last month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icc-to-present-cases-against-instigators-of-kenya-post-election-violence.php">present two cases</a> against the six individuals most responsible for causing the post-election violence, down from the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-prosecutor-accuses-officials-in.php">initial 20 officials</a> [JURIST reports] the ICC prosecutor initially accused. It has not been revealed if Ruto will be among those charged, although he was implicated in the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/dmdocuments/KNCHR%20doc.pdf">initial report on the violence</a> [text, PDF] compiled by the KNCHR. In September, a businessman <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-businessman-challenges-legality-of-icc-investigation.php">challenged the legality of the ICC investigation</a>, claiming it was made illegal by Kenya's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">recently ratified constitution</a> [JURIST reports]. However, Justice and Constitutional Affairs <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/justice.htm">Minister Mutula Kilonzo</a> [official website], said the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-justice-minister-denies-challenge-to-icc-investigation.php">government supports the investigation</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-grants-prosecutors-request-to.php">ICC began conducting an investigation</a> in March after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/kenya-parliament-rejects-bills.php">Kenyan parliament rejected</a> [JURIST reports] conducting their own in February. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">Kenyan presidential election of 2007</a> [JURIST report] left at least 1,000 people dead and 500,000 displaced in Kenya after protests erupted from allegations that <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] committed voter fraud.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nabil, a former law student, was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-blogger-sentenced-to-prison-for.php">convicted in 2007</a> [JURIST report] for posting statements critical of Islamic authorities and Egyptian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6045958.stm">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile], calling him a dictator. Nabil also allegedly called his university, <a href="http://www.azhar.edu.eg/">Al-Azhar University</a> [academic website, in Arabic], "the university of terrorism." Charges against him included inciting sedition, insulting Islam, harming national unity and insulting the president. Nabil's four-year sentence had ended on November 5, but he was held by authorities for 10 more days for unknown reasons. Following the expiration of his prison sentence, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on Egyptian authorities to immediately <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egyptian-blogger-held-despite-completing-prison-sentence-2010-11-11">investigate allegations of mistreatment</a> [press release] and to explain the reasons for his continued detention. On Wednesday, <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://en.rsf.org/egypt-blogger-kareem-amer-finally-17-11-2010,38830.html">praised his release</a> [press release], criticizing Egyptian authorities for what the rights group described as poor conditions of his detention, "physical mistreatment" and torture. Egyptian authorities have yet to release a statement. Nabil's supporters have said that government repression and censorship have become more prevalent in recent years, as the US has let up political pressure for reforms. Nabil's case was the first in which a blogger has been charged with a crime. 

<p>The Egyptian government has faced ongoing criticism from international human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners. On Tuesday, AI called for Egyptian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ai-calls-for-investigation-into-death-of-young-man-who-was-allegedly-in-police-custody.php">promptly and thoroughly investigate</a> [JURIST report] the death of 19-year-old Ahmed Shaaban who was allegedly tortured in police custody. Sidi Gaber police officers are also currently under investigation for another incident in which a man was dragged out of a cafe and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/06/24/egypt-prosecute-police-beating-death">publicly beat to death</a> [HRW report]. According to the US State Department's Human Rights Report for Egypt, in 2009, there were <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136067.htm">30 reported instances of torture in police custody</a> [DOS report]. Egyptian authorities investigated some of these, and, in several of the cases, punished the responsible officers and made them pay compensation to the victims. In 2008, it <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/egypt-suspends-280-police-officers-for.php">suspended 280 police officers</a> [JURIST report] alleged to have abused their power and committed human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The jury in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] deliberated for five days before <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/17/AR2010111707280.html">finding Ghailani guilty</a> [WP report; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/nov/18/guantanamo-cleared-african-embassy-bombing-video">video</a>] of conspiracy to damage or destroy US property. The charge carries a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and could result in a life sentence. A guilty verdict on only one of the 285 charges is somewhat of a blow to the Obama administration's hopes to try prominent terror suspects in federal court. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/November/10-opa-1315.html">brief statement</a> [text] following the verdict indicating that they are pleased that Ghailani will face at least 20 years in US prison. Critics of the administration's desire to try terrorists in US courts view the result as proof that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/nyregion/19detainees.html?_r=1&hp">civilian courts are not the place</a> [NYT report] for terrorists. Many cite to the judge's <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-bars-key-witness-in-trial-of-ex-guantanamo-detainee.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] to exclude testimony and a key government witness that came from confessions made during enhanced interrogation as an example of why civilian courts are not suited for terrorist trials.

<p>Earlier in the week, a defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-denies-motion-for-mistrial-of-ex-guantanamo-detainee.php">motion for mistrial was denied</a> [JURIST report] after an anonymous juror's note was read in court, indicating that the juror was alone in her views and was being attacked for her conclusions. The juror requested to be removed or replaced. The trial began in October with <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-court-hears-opening-statements-in-ex-guantanamo-detainees-civilian-trial.php">opening statements</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the judge ruled that Ghailani is not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-rules-former-guantanamo-detainee-fit-to-stand-trial.php">fit to stand trial </a>[JURIST report]. In June, Judge Lewis Kaplan denied a request from Ghailani to be exempt from prison strip searches, citing <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-subject-to-strip-search.php">security concerns</a> [JURIST report]. In May, Kaplan refused to dismiss criminal charges against Ghailani despite claims that he had been tortured in prison. Kaplan held that even if Ghailani was mistreated while in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] custody, there was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-drop-charges-against-exguantanamo-detainee.php">no connection between that and the current prosecution</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

General Noel Rakotonandrasana allegedly led a group of about 20 soldiers into the capital city and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/africa/18madagascar.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">tried to take control</a> [NYT report] of government institutions and seize power from <a href="http://www.madagascar-presidency.gov.mg/president/">President Andry Rajoelina</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7943820.stm">profile</a>] on the same day that citizens voted to amend the constitution. Thirty-six-year-old Rajoelina, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madagascar-court-approves-president.php">came to power</a> [JURIST report] last year after a military coup, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/17/madagascar">organized the national referendum</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to change the president's minimum age requirement in Madagascar's <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ma00000_.html">constitution</a> [text] from 40 to 35 years of age, so that he could run in the next presidential election. Former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1866530.stm">Marc Ravalomanana</a> [BBC profile], who was ousted last year by Rajoelina, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gv7H_72esb6E6FEQoGgAJfoNy5bg?docId=CNG.9be0c029adaf0eb4667c81e939f5af84.3c1">supported the military action</a> [AFP report] and saw it as an effort to promote democracy. The capital city has been operating normally as the soldiers stay nearby at a military base, despite <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/madagascarNews/idAFLDE6AG1RW20101117">threats</a> [Reuters report] to take over the presidential palace and the international airport.

<p>Madagascar has faced <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6AG1X920101117?pageNumber=1">ongoing political unrest</a> [Reuters timeline] for almost two years, and Rajoelina's regime has not been recognized by the international community. In August, a Madagascar court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/madagascar-ex-president-sentenced-over-protester-deaths.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Ravalomanana to life in prison with hard labor for ordering the killing of opposition protesters in February 2009. Ravalomanana, who has been living in South Africa since his overthrow in March of last year, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11120620">sentenced <em>in absentia</em></a> [BBC report] on charges of murder and accessory to murder in connection with the deaths of at least 30 people by his presidential guard. Ravalomanana has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madagascar-ex-president-sentenced-in.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three times since he left power, and his lawyer claimed that the trials have been politically motivated to keep him from returning to Madagascar and running for reelection.

The order comes after a gay French couple challenged the ban in a Reims court, saying it <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/French-court-to-examine-legality-of-same-sex-marriage-ban/articleshow/6938061.cms#ixzz15eLrbzI5">limited their personal freedoms</a> [AFP report]. Rights groups are optimistic that the ban will be overturned, as the trend in French law is moving towards equal rights among gay and straight couples. Last year, a French court ordered the country's government to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/france-court-rules-gay-woman-may-adopt.php">extend adoption rights to a gay woman</a> [JURIST report]. The court held that French <a href="http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_title08.html#chapter1">adoption law</a> [Article VIII French Civil Code], which currently allows single people to adopt children but bars same-sex partners from doing so, <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/11/10/la-justice-autorise-l-adoption-d-un-enfant-par-un-couple-d-homosexuelles_1265022_3224.html">illegally discriminates</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French] against homosexuals. 

<p>Courts both foreign and domestic are increasingly having to rule on the issue of gay marriage. In the US, judges in <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wyoming-same-sex-marriage-ban-challenged.php">Wyoming</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">California</a> [JURIST reports] have confronted the issue this year. Governments in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/argentina-lower-house-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Argentina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/kenya-lawmakers-refuse-to-include-equal.php">Kenya</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mexico-city-legislature-approves-same.php">Mexico</a> [JURIST reports] are also addressing the issue. In 2007, the French Court of Cassation ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/france-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">same-sex marriages are not valid under French law</a> [JURIST report] and that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. The case arose in 2004 when Stephane Charpin and Bertrand Charpentier were <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/frances-first-same-sex-marriage.htm">married</a>  [JURIST report], after which both a local court and intermediate appeals court ruled that the marriage was invalid. State lawyers argued that it was not an issue for the courts to decide, but rather was a question to be answered by parliament. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] officer was allegedly complicit in the abuse of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>], causing him to falsely admit to terrorism charges. The US <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dropped all charges</a> against Mohamed in 2008, and he was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">returned</a> [JURIST reports] to Britain in 2009, after spending nearly seven years in detention, including four years at Guantanamo Bay. The prosecutor said investigations will continue of people higher up in the chain of command as well as <a href="http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/sis-home-welcome.html">MI6</a> [official website] officers. Earlier this week, the UK agreed to pay 16 former Guantanamo detainees, including Mohamed, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] over claims that its agents colluded in torture abroad. The UK said that the settlement was not an admission of guilt.

<p>The <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/civilappeals.htm">England and Wales Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/482.html">ruled</a> [judgment text] in May that state intelligence agencies <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">cannot use secret evidence</a> [JURIST report] in their defense against abuse accusations by Mohamed and several other UK residents who were held at Guantanamo Bay. The judgment overturned a November <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2009/2959.html">ruling</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uk-court-rules-evidence-may-be-kept.php">report</a>] of a UK high court, which held that defendants MI5 and MI6 could utilize a "closed material procedure" that would allow them to rely on certain evidence without disclosing it to opposing counsel or committing it to the public record. The procedure, typically employed in criminal proceedings, is designed to allow concealment of evidence where disclosure would cause "real harm to the public interest," harm the agencies argued would result if they were compelled to publicly adduce state intelligence as part of their defense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court dismissed CLS's claim on the grounds that CLS had not raised the nondiscrimination policy issue in its opening brief:<blockquote>CLS's hindsight attempt to string together an argument from quotes scattered throughout its opening brief confirms that it made no pretext argument at all, much less "specifically and distinctly." [...] But even after assiduously digging through CLS's opening brief, and carefully reviewing the passages CLS claims contain its pretext argument, we've found nothing reasonably supporting its existence.</blockquote>CLS argued that it had preserved the selective application issue throughout arguments before the court. Hastings <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-hears-religious-student.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the local chapter's application for registered student organization (RSO) status because the CLS bylaws exclude students based on religion and sexual orientation. Hastings' RSO policy mirrors the state discrimination policy and mandates that RSOs must allow "all comers" to participate regardless of status or beliefs. 

<p>In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST news archive] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1371.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1371">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-upholds-all-comers-mandate-for-student-group-funding-at-public-school.php">report</a>] that the "all comers" policy at Hastings, which limits funding to student organizations that adopt the school's nondiscrimination policy, is reasonable and viewpoint neutral and does not violate the First Amendment. CLS claimed that Hastings' refusal to grant the group RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association and free exercise of religion, and sought an exemption from the school's open-access requirement. The Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's ruling, holding that Hastings' policy met these specifications under the school's educational mission, but limited its opinion to "all comers" policies at public institutions. In 2004, CLS became the first group to seek exemption from Hastings' nondiscrimination policy. CLS chapters exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in "unrepentant homosexual conduct" or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith, which all members are required to sign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The nine plaintiffs are adults who were sentenced to life without parole when they were minors. The rights group argues that sentencing children to lifelong prison sentences without the possibility of parole violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html#amdt14a_hd13">due process</a> and constitutes <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt8_user.html#amdt8_hd8">cruel and unusual punishment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] under the Fourth and Eighth Amendments, respectively. Deborah Labelle, a lawyer for the ACLU of Michigan, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/human-rights-racial-justice/aclu-lawsuit-challenges-life-without-parole-michigan-juveniles">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>These life without parole sentences ignore the very real differences between children and adults, abandoning the concepts of redemption and second chances. As a society, we believe children do not have the capacity to handle adult responsibilities, so we don't allow them to use alcohol, join the Army, serve on a jury or vote - yet we sentence them to the harshest punishment we have in this state - to die in adult prisons.</blockquote> Under Michigan law, minors between ages 14 and 17 must be tried as adults if charged with certain felonies. If the minors are convicted, then judges lack sentencing discretion and must give mandatory life sentences without parole. 

<p>According to the ACLU, the US is the only country to sentence children to life in prison without parole. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-7412.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-life-sentences-for-juveniles-facing-non-homicide-charges.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-7412">Graham v. Florida</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the imprisonment of a juvenile for life without the possibility of parole as punishment for the juvenile's commission of a non-homicide offense. The court made a similar ruling in 2005 in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZS.html">Roper v. Simmons</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the constitution prohibits capital punishment in cases against juveniles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36785&Cr=Bolivia&Cr1=">commended progress</a> [UN News Centre report] by the Bolivian government in adopting reforms to end discrimination while voicing concerns over the lack of access to justice, particularly in rural communities. Noting various advances, Pillay commended several social programs adopted by the Bolivian government, particularly ones aimed at alleviating poverty and exclusion. Pillay suggested that "the soundest nation-building is one that takes into full account and promotes the rights of all citizens irrespective of their ethnicity, culture, sex, age, class or language." Pillay's comments come after her first visit to the country, where she spent five days talking to <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/">President Evo Morales</a> [official website, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3203752.stm">profile</a>] and other key government officials. In addition, Pillay met with indigenous representatives and authorities, torture victims, and representatives from the Afro-Bolivian community.

<p>The UN reported last year that the indigenous people of Bolivia and Paraguay are often <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31892&Cr=indigenous&Cr1=">forced into labor and face discrimination</a> [press release], severe poverty and violence, urging the two countries to take action in order to protect the human rights of these groups. In October, Morales signed a controversial <a href="http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/07/179617_pdf.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF; in Spanish] into law that permits the government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/bolivia-president-signs-controversial-anti-racism-bill-into-law.php">punish media outlets for publishing racist content</a> [JURIST report]. The legislation comes as part of a wider campaign by Morales to advance the interests of the majority indigenous community, which has been a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/bolivia-president-promises-justice-for.php">theme of his presidency</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the Bolivian National Congress approved legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bolivia-congress-advances-indigenous-rights-bill.php">create an independent justice system</a> [JURIST report] for indigenous communities. Bolivia's new <a href="http://www.constituyentesoberana.org/3/leyesdecretos/052010/250510_1.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF text, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in February 2009, giving more power to the country's indigenous majority. Morales said that the charter represented a new beginning, by providing for <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-constitution-reforms-called.php">redistribution of land and natural resource revenues</a> [JURIST report], the creation of congressional seats reserved for indigenous representatives and the institution of special courts for some indigenous communities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, introduced by <a href="http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2009_10/house/bios/riceTom/riceTomBio.htm">Rep. Tom Rice</a> (R) [official website], amends <a href="http://www.roswellgov.com/DocumentView.aspx?DID=978">Title 50, Chapter 36</a> [text, PDF] of the Georgia code to include post-secondary education among the public benefits that require a verification of lawful presence in the US. Last month, the <a href="http://www.usg.edu/regents/">Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia</a> [official website], adopted a policy under which five Georgia universities were effectively <a href="http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/111810/new_737801301.shtml">barred from admitting illegal immigrants</a> [AP report] starting fall 2011. The legislation will be considered by the state legislators in January. 

<p>The issue of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] has been the subject of legislation and lawsuits across the country. On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S167791.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that illegal immigrants are eligible to receive in-state tuition benefits at California's public colleges and universities. The court concluded that the California law did not violate federal immigration law because the exemption was not based on formal legal residency. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">denied</a> motions to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">dismiss a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the constitutionality of the controversial Arizona <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Under the law, it is designated a crime to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500. In September, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that two ordinances passed by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, making it more difficult for illegal immigrants to live or work in the town are <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling was issued in a case involving efforts to recall <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/">Senator Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) [official website]. The recall proceedings were triggered last September after a recall committee filed a notice of intent to recall with the New Jersey secretary of state. The secretary of state refused to begin the proceedings after determining that such efforts would violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">US Constitution</a> [text]. The recall committee appealed the decision to the state appeals court, which determined that the recall was constitutional. In overturning the lower court's ruling, the Supreme Court examined the US Constitution and historical record surrounding ratification. The court held that, because the US Constitution explicitly set the requirements for a senator's term and manner of removal, states are preempted from enacting laws authorizing the recall of senators. In its ruling, the court also addressed the portion of the state statute allowing recall of local officials. The court held that recall at the local level is valid and recognized local recall as an important way to hold state and local officials accountable. A spokesman for Menendez indicated that the court's ruling is a <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/nj_recall_committee_with_ties.html">victory against fringe groups</a> [<em>Star Ledger</em> report] attempting to corrupt the political process. Lawyers for the recall committee have indicated they will appeal the decision to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>]. 

<p>The US Supreme Court has previously struck down state statutes attempting to place additional requirements or limits on federally elected officials. In 2001, the court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-929.ZS.html">Cook v. Gralike</a> [materials] that a Missouri law requiring notice of a candidate's position on term limits to be placed on election ballots was a violation of the constitution. The court held that states have limited power related to federal elections under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Elections Clause</a> [text], which primarily grants power to proscribe procedures for federal elections. In 1995, the court similarly struck down an Arkansas constitutional amendment placing term limits on federal offices in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1456.ZS.html">US Term Limits v. Thorton</a> [materials]. The court held that states have no authority to "change, add to or diminish" the requirements enumerated in the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Qualifications Clause</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bout was <a href="http://www.interpol.int/public/ICPO/PressReleases/PR2008/PR200810.asp">arrested</a> [Interpol press release] in 2008 in a joint operation carried out by US and Thai authorities in which he allegedly sought to sell arms to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9272/farc_eln.html">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [CFR backgrounder]. Russia has continued to show strong support for Bout, claiming that he is an innocent businessman. If convicted, Bout could receive a maximum of a life sentence and a minimum of 25 years. Bout's next court date is scheduled for January 10. 

<p>Earlier this week, the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/thailand-extradites-accused-russian-arms-dealer-to-us.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] Bout to the US to stand trail.

The court's ruling overturned a decision it issued a year earlier, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/thailand-court-refuses-extradition-to.php">refusing to extradite Bout</a> [JURIST report] on the basis that the accusations made by the US were not cognizable under Thai law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The directive came <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/chief-justice-florida-supreme-court-says-state-foreclosure-court-hearings-must-be-ope">in response to transparency concerns</a> [ACLU report] raised by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], media outlets and open-government organizations. These groups were particularly concerned by reports from across the state that suggested a number of foreclosure courts were allowing proceedings to occur behind closed doors rather than publicly as mandated by Florida law. In the memo, Canady stated that "[t]he courts of Florida belong to the people of Florida. The people of Florida are entitled to know what takes place in the courts of this state. No crisis justifies the administrative suspension of the strong legal presumption that state court proceedings are open to the public."

<p>In October, New York <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/appeals/chjjl.htm">Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/pdfs/AdminOrder_2010_10_20.pdf">announced</a> [statement, PDF] a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/new-york-courts-requiring-lawyers-to-confirm-accuracy-of-foreclosure-paperwork.php">new court rule</a> [JURIST report] that requires lawyers to file a separate <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/foreclosures/Affirmation-Foreclosure.pdf">affirmation</a> [form, PDF] confirming the accuracy of paperwork used in residential foreclosure cases. The new rule was effective immediately and has been added to the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/index.htm">New York State Unified Court System</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/foreclosures.shtml">residential foreclosure rules</a> [text]. Lippman explained that the new rule was an effort to <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/press/pr2010_12.shtml">provide better protection</a> [press release] to people facing the possibility of losing their home, particularly in response to the recent discoveries of errors in foreclosure documents nationwide. Also in October, attorneys general from all 50 states and the District of Columbia <a href="http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/oct_2010/Foreclosure_Affidavit_joint_stmt.pdf">announced</a> [joint statement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/state-ags-to-investigate-foreclosure-practices.php">report</a>] that they have formed a bipartisan group called the Mortgage Foreclosure Multistate Group (MFMG), which will investigate allegations of procedural defects committed by mortgage loan companies during foreclosure processes. The MFMG explained that its investigation will focus on "robo-signing," a process by which individuals signed affidavits and other foreclosure documents without having personal knowledge of the facts and without confirming the accuracy of supporting documentation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXYtQ4oYcU1jex63lHKcrOom4N6g?docId=CNG.84021ce08fb57eea0b910a170ea74146.191">approved</a> [AFP report] by a vote of 19-0, and has received strong support from the entertainment industry. The bill would create a more streamlined and efficient process for the Justice Department to crack down on websites involved in piracy or the sale of counterfeit goods, even allowing for courts to order the shutdown of domains based outside the US. While the measure met no opposition in committee, it has been criticized widely by digital rights groups and it is likely to face some opposition when it goes before the full <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> or <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official websites].

<p>In October, the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/">Office of the US Trade Representative</a> (USTR) [official website] and other participating countries <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/nations-unveil-draft-of-international-anti-counterfeiting-pact.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/webfm_send/2338">draft</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2010/acta-fact-sheet-and-guide-public-draft-text">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA) [USTR backgrounder], an international pact to defend intellectual property rights from counterfeit and piracy. The draft was released after <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-european-commission-announce.php">three years</a> [JURIST report] and 10 rounds of negotiations among the ACTA parties, which include the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia, Mexico and Korea, representing more than 50 percent of world trade. The agreement would establish a framework for combating counterfeiting and piracy of commercial goods that encourages international cooperation as well as strong enforcement practices. Participating countries agreed to further examine the document and plan to finalize the text of the agreement as soon as possible. The agreement will undergo a final review before it is opened for signatures. Notably, China, a source of many of the world's counterfeit goods, is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6951ZP20101006">not a participant</a> [Reuters report] in the agreement or discussions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new package includes <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AH42X20101118">USD $15.8 million</a> [Reuters report], adding to the original disbursement in June of USD $148 million. The compensation was approved after the government faced criticism for perceived leniency in the sentencing of seven men <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/india-court-hands-down-convictions-in-bhopal-gas-case.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in June on charges of "death by negligence." The men were sentenced to two years imprisonment and ordered to pay USD $2,100. The convictions were the first related to the Bhopal disaster in which nearly 3,800 people were killed when toxic gas was accidentally released in the middle of the night by a chemical plant owned by a <a href="http://www.unioncarbide.com/about/index.htm">Union Carbide</a> [corporate website] subsidiary company. Upwards of 15,000 others later died from exposure to the gas, and 50,000 were left permanently disabled.

<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Indian Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced in August that it will <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/india-high-court-to-reconsider-bhopal-convictions.php">reconsider a ruling</a> [JURIST report] allowing the men to be charged with negligence instead of culpable homicide. If the convictions are overturned and the men tried on charges of culpable homicide, they could face sentences of up to 10 years in prison. In July, the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/india-apologizes-for-improperly-dumping-waste-related-to-bhopal-gas-incident.php">apologized for improperly dumping waste</a> [JURIST report] related to the incident The apology came one month after cabinet ministers announced the government would consider increasing compensation for victims of the disaster and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/india-to-consider-further-penalties-in-related-to-bhopal-gas-incident.php">seek the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of the former chairman of Union Carbide so he could stand trial in India.  A settlement was reached between Union Carbide and the Indian government in 1989 with the company paying $470 million to end its liability. The cabinet members, however, indicated the government was willing to revisit the settlement and possibly seek further compensation from Union Carbide. <a href="http://www.dow.com/">Dow Chemicals</a> [corporate website], which purchased Union Carbide in 1999, contends that the settlement ended all possible claims against the company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Deputy+Prosecutor+_Prosecutions_.htm">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile], urged security forces to refrain from using excessive force against civilians. The statement asserted that the ICC would evaluate all reported acts of violence resulting from the crackdown. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] also declared its <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36804&Cr=+Guinea+&Cr1">concern over the actions of the security forces</a> [UN News Centre report] in reacting to election demonstrations. The Guinean government declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, three days after Alpha Conde was declared the winner of the November 7 run-off election. The OHCHR reports excessive use of force against unarmed civilians by the Force Speciale de Securisation du Processus Electoral, a special police unit that was formed to secure the electoral process. Additionally, there have been reports of ethnically motivated violence between the Peuhl and Malinke groups. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] also i<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/guinea-authorities-must-stop-arbitrary-arrests-and-killings-2010-11-18">called on Guinean authorities to halt killings</a> [text], arbitrary arrests and torture that have resulted from post-election crackdown. The state of emergency will be in effect until the election results are confirmed by the Supreme Court, expected to be next Monday. 

<p>November's election ended two years of military rule under a transitional government formed by military captain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who staged a coup in the wake of the death of former president <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/23/lansana-conte-profile">Lansana Conte</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], the nation's ruler for 24 years. In October, the OHCHR expressed concern that security forces in Guinea "<a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-rights-office-says-guinea-security-forces-committed-abuses-in-election-demonstrations.php">committed serious human rights violations</a>" [JURIST report] in subduing demonstrations. In September, two Guinean election officials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guinea-officials-convicted-of-election-fraud.php">convicted of election fraud</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to a year in jail in connection with irregularities that arose in the June presidential primary election, one incident in a string of controversies responsible for multiple delays of the runoff, which was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/guineaNews/idAFLDE66K1LY20100721?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">initially scheduled for July</a> [Reuters report].

The protesters had rallied against Camara, who announced in October that he intended to push elections forward three months and stand for election, breaking a promise not to run made shortly after he took power. Camara was ultimately forced into exile two months later after an assassination attempt staged by one of his aides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The brief, filed in the <a href = "http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] supports the suit's proposed arguments that the PPACA violates the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. In making their argument, the senators attacked the individual mandate, arguing:<blockquote>Indeed, in more than 200 years of debate as to the proper scope of the Commerce Power, the Supreme Court has never suggested that the Commerce Power allows Congress to impose affirmative obligations on passive individuals, or to punish individuals for failing to purchase a particular product. To the contrary, every landmark Commerce Clause case has dealt with congressional efforts to regulate different kinds of activity under the Commerce power. In every significant Commerce Clause case the Supreme Court has always had to decide whether Congress may regulate a given form of activity.</blockquote><em>The Hill</em> lists the 33 <a href = "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/130037-mcconnell-and-32-republicans-file-brief-on-repealing-health-reform">signatories</a> to the brief, all of whom <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00396">voted against passage</a> [roll call] of the bill. 

<p>Florida <a href = "http://myfloridalegal.com/">Attorney General Bill McCollum</a> [official website] filed the lawsuit in March, which is joined by <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">20 states</a> [JURIST report] and the <a href = "http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>]. The suit was <a href = "http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">allowed to proceed</a> [JURIST report] in October, despite an attempt to dismiss. On Thursday, McCollum sent a <a href = "http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-8BBKU3/$file/McCollum_BondiLetter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] asking 13 other state attorneys general to join Florida in the suit. A federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in October that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions and it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax. In August, a federal judge allowed a similar lawsuit filed in Virginia to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">proceed on narrow grounds</a> [JURIST report], addressing only <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/subject-matter_jurisdiction">subject matter jurisdiction</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the legal sufficiency of the complaint. Several days later, McCollum cited the ruling in his <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-files-response-to-motion-to-dismiss-health-care-lawsuit.php">response</A> [JURIST report] to the Obama administration's motion to dismiss the Florida challenge, filed in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6AH0LL20101118">Honduras investigation</a> [Reuters report] will focus on the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">June 2009 coup</a> [JURIST report] that removed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123134.stm">Manuel Zeleya</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zelaya">news archive</a>] from power. Moreno-Ocampo did not elaborate on the Nigeria investigation. Following a preliminary investigation, Article 15 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] requires the prosecutor to submit his findings to the ICC's pre-trial chamber if he believes there is a reasonable basis to proceed with a formal investigation. If the pre-trial chamber agrees that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation and finds it likely that the ICC has jurisdiction, it will authorize Moreno-Ocampo's office to conduct such an investigation.

<p>In July, a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/honduras-judge-drops-abuse-of-power-charges-against-ousted-leader-zelaya.php">dismissed abuse of power charges</a> against Zeleya because Zelaya's successor <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-president-pardons-military.php">granted amnesty</a> [JURIST reports] to Zeleya and those involved in his removal. In June, <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-honduras-to-investigate-violations-stemming-from-2009-coup.php">accused the Honduran government</a> [JURIST report] of failing to address human rights violations stemming from the June 2009 coup. AI contends that hundreds of people opposed to the coup have been beaten and detained. The group cited evidence that judges critical of the coup have "suffered a series of arbitrary transferrals and unfair disciplinary proceedings" as well as threats and intimidation. The interim government has been attempting to restore Honduras's reputation internationally. In May, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] announced that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/honduras-drops-suit-against-brazil-for-sheltering-ousted-president-zelaya.php">Honduras dropped proceedings against Brazil</a> [JURIST report] brought by the Honduran interim government last October in response to the sheltering of Zelaya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Holder calls for increased use of DNA evidence</title>

Among the changes, defendants who plead guilty will no longer have to waive their right to DNA evidence under the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/dpic-summary-innocence-protection-act-2004">Innocence Protection Act of 2004</a> [text]. The memo also calls for the collection of DNA from all federal arrestees. Holder said in the press release that DNA collection, when available, is the most helpful ways to find facts:<blockquote>DNA evidence is one of the most powerful tools available to the criminal justice system, and these new steps will ensure the department can use DNA to the greatest extent possible to solve crimes and ensure the guilty are convicted. Improving both the collection and the use of DNA evidence will help law enforcement and prosecutors keep communities safe."</blockquote>The collection of DNA from federal arrestees has already been enacted, but Holder stressed it as a priority.

<p>Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-access-to-dna-testing.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Skinner v. Switzer</span> on a convicted prisoner's right to seek access to DNA testing. The issue is whether a convicted prisoner seeking access to biological evidence for DNA testing may assert a civil rights claim under &#167; 1983 or if such a claim is cognizable only under a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court decision to dismiss Skinner's &#167; 1983 claim seeking access to DNA evidence that may prove his innocence in the murders for which he is now sentenced to death, stating that relief could only be sought through habeas corpus. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-6">District Attorney's Office v. Osborne</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-finds-no-constitutional.php">report</a>] that a defendant does not have the right to obtain post-conviction access to the state&#8217;s biological evidence in order to do DNA testing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Costa Rica contends that 50 Nicaraguan soldiers remain in the area and that <a href="http://www.ticotimes.net/News/News-Briefs/Costa-Rica-Takes-Dispute-With-Nicaragua-to-the-Hague_Friday-November-19-2010">Nicaragua is attempting to build a canal </a> [<em>Tico Times</em> report] there. The filling came after Nicaraguan President Jose Daniel Ortega rejected a nearly unanimous <a href="http://www.oas.org">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) [official website] <a href="http://www.oas.org/consejo/resolutions/res978.asp">resolution</a> [text] inviting Nicaragua to withdraw its troops. Ortega indicated the OAS had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/15/google-map-dispute-nicaragua">killed any possibility of resolving the dispute through dialogue</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and lashed out at several neighboring OAS member states accusing them of being influenced by the drug trade. Ortega's environmental adviser also decried the environmental damage claims <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5hZphmpL4W6eO5zQpYtwbAzuJxFcg?docId=1409218">accusing Costa Rica of polluting the San Jose river</a> [EFE report, in Spanish]. Costa Rica has requested the court <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/11/19/nicaragua.costa.rica.dispute/">stop the construction of the canal</a> [CNN report] to avoid irreparable harm. The OAS is set reconvene in December to <a href="http://www.latercera.com/noticia/mundo/2010/11/678-308622-9-costa-rica-eleva-demanda-contra-nicaragua-ante-corte-internacional-de-justicia.shtml">attempt to resolve the dispute</a> [<em>La Tercera Mundo</em> report, in Spanish], but it is questionable whether Nicaragua will comply. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rene Castro has expressed confidence, however, that the ICJ can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/19/AR2010111900020.html">compel Nicaragua to withdraw</a> [AP report].

<p>The dispute centers around Calero Island, a small area of land at the mouth of the San Jose river which has been <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2010/11/nicaragua-costa-rica-google-images-border-dispute.html">disputed territory for over a century</a> [LAT report]. The dispute arose last month when Eden Pastora, director of the dredging project, relied on a <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/11/costa-rican-nicaraguan-country-border.html">Google Maps error</a> [Google Maps statement] based on flawed US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] information to send troops to the area that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/arias-urges-costa-rica-to-take-google-maps-border-dispute-to-un.html">Nicaragua now refuses to leave</a> [Bloomberg report]. In 2009, the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icj-rules-costa-rica-has-right-to.php">adjudicated another dispute</a> [JURIST report] between Costa Rica and Nicaragua surrounding use of the San Jose river, which separates the two Central American nations. The court <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/133/15321.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] in July 2009 that Nicaragua had interfered with Costa Rica's right of free navigation on the San Juan river four years after Costa Rica filed the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=coni&case=133&k=37">complaint</a> [case materials] in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The parties <a href="http://www.877wtchero.com/wtcverdict/11-19-10%20Allocation%20Neutral%20%20Opt-In%20Report.pdf">relayed</a> [settlement document; <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attorneys-and-court-confirm-success-of-911-settlement-109267934.html">press release</a>] to Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] that 95.1 percent of the 10,043 eligible plaintiffs opted in to the settlement, barely reaching the 95 percent threshold. The plaintiffs, represented by <a href="http://www.877wtchero.com/index.html">Paul Napoli and his law firm</a> [firm website], had faced a Tuesday deadline to approve the settlement, which leads to a total payout of at least $625 million. Each individual plaintiff will  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/nyregion/20zero.html?src=twrhp">receive between $3,250 and $1.8 million</a> [NYT report], depending on the extend of their injuries and illnesses. The settlement divides the plaintiffs into four tiers depending on their severity of their injuries. Over 98 percent of tier-four plaintiffs, with the worst injuries, opted in to the negotiated settlement. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were unsure whether late filed opt-in papers will be accepted by the court.

<p>The settlement should bring some relief to the plaintiffs after seven years of litigation. Hellerstein had <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/11/19/911-health-settlement-accepted-by-95-of-plaintiffs/">encouraged</a> [WSJ report] the plaintiffs to accept the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nyc-reaches-7125-million-settlement-with-world-trade-center-cleanup-workers.php">$712.5 million settlement agreement</a> that was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-approves-settlement-with-911-cleanup-workers.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] last June. Hellerstein approved this settlement after lawyers had agreed to reduce their fees from 33.33 percent to 25 percent after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-rejects-proposed.php">throwing out an earlier agreement</a> [JURIST report] in March. In 2007, Hellerstein <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-permits-911-cleanup.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the class action lawsuit filed by cleanup workers against the city and the Port Authority could proceed.

Al Khazmi was arrested by Internal Security agents without a warrant in 2006 and died while in custody. The documents include an autopsy that noted "bruising and contusions all over [al Khazmi's] body" and concluded that his death was a result of blunt force trauma. The groups have also obtained a prosecutor's report noting that General Saleh Ragam, the agency's head, declined to investigate the incident. The documents have been submitted to the UN Special Rapporteurs on <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Torture, Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions</a>, and on the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/judiciary/index.htm">Independence of Judges and Lawyers</a> [official websites] for review. Alkarama and TRIAL previously submitted the claims to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website], which is expected to <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101119/world/libya_rights_torture_ngo">release its findings</a> [AFP report] in 2011.

<p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/libya-human-rights-progress-stalling-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in June stating that Libya had made some progress with regards to human rights, but that the situation remained "dire." The report included violations by the ISA, which "appear[s] to have unchecked powers to arrest, detain and interrogate individuals suspected of dissent or of terrorism-related activities." AI also echoed concerns about the use of the death penalty, which the group expressed weeks earlier when it <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/libya-executes-18-firing-squad-2010-06-01">condemned the execution</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-condemns-libya-executions.php">report</a>] of 18 people, including foreign nationals, in Libya. HRW issued a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/12/12/truth-and-justice-can-t-wait">similar report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/libya-making-slow-progress-on-human.php">report</a>] in December, finding that Libya is making strides towards greater transparency and acknowledgment of human rights but that it still has a long way to go.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] has twice approved the settlements, but the Senate previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-senate-fails-to-approve-minority-farmer-settlement.php">failed to do so</a> [JURIST report] in August after members of the Republican party objected to a unanimous consent motion proposed by Democratic members. The legislation will now return to the House before proceeding to President Barack Obama, who stated his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/19/statement-president-senate-passage-claims-settlement-act-2010">intent to sign the bill into law</a> [press release].

<p>Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-extends-deadline-for-congress-to-approve-indian-trust-settlement.php">extended the deadline</a> [JURIST report] for Congress to approve the Indian Trust settlement to January 7, 2011, marking the <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/docs/key_docs.php">seventh time</a> [case materials] an extension had been granted since the settlement was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. The settlements arose from two cases. Elouise Cobell originally filed litigation in 1996 related to DOI's alleged mismanagement of the Indian Trust, which was established by Congress in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases to Indian lands. Although it was determined that the US government had not engaged in fraud, it was held that DOI unreasonably delayed accounting of the trust. In 1999, black farmers alleged in <a href="http://www.bfaa-us.org/pigford-v-glickman.html">Pigford v. Glickman</a> [BFAA backgrounder] that they were being denied USDA farm loans or forced to wait longer for loan approval than were non-minority farmers.

This decision overturns the trial chamber's July <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc914784.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF]. In its judgment, the appeals chamber ruled that the trial chamber must consider both changed circumstances and if the grounds on which the decision for detention was chosen persist. Pursuant to Article 60 the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute(e).pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text], chambers are obligated to review an accused person's detention once every 120 days. Bemba is set to go on trial Monday.

<p>Last month, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc955067.pdf">affirmed</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/B94483A3-4F6E-403B-93B6-B3782AF0F1A6.htm">press release</a>] a trial chamber ruling and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-allows-trial-of-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to-proceed.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Bemba's appeal challenging the admissibility of his case before the ICC. The court also concluded that the ICC's jurisdiction over the case does not violate a Rome Statute provision that prohibits the ICC from hearing cases after a country has decided not to prosecute the person concerned. In April, defense lawyers argued before the court that charges against Bemba <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawyers-for-congo-rebel-leader-bemba.php">should be dropped</a> [JURIST report] because he had been denied due process and the charges are illegal. In addition, defense lawyers claimed that Bemba <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/congo-rebel-leader-bemba-claims-lack-of-funds-precludes-fair-trial.php">lacked the financial resources</a> [JURIST report] necessary to ensure a fair trial. The ICC ordered Bemba to stand trial in July 2009 for <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] committed between October 2002 and May 2003 while he was a military leader of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC). Bemba was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Belgium in May 2008 after the ICC issued a sealed warrant for his arrest.

The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-house-votes-to-ban-animal-cruelty-videos.php">approved the same ban</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, and the provision is now being forward to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] for his signature. If the bill is signed into law, the creating, selling or distributing animal crush videos, which feature small animals being tortured or killed, will be a crime punishable with up to five years in prison. This is a revision of 1999 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">legislation</a> [18 USC &#167; 48 text] that was struck down by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=US+Supreme+Court">news archive</a>] in April. Specifically, the revised legislation more narrowly defines what constitutes a crush video, excluding videos depicting "customary and normal veterinary or agricultural husbandry practices," as well as videos of hunting, fishing or trapping. 

<p>Congress was forced to revise the act following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-769">United States v. Stevens</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], in which the 1999 law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] for being substantially overbroad and therefore in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. Legislators hope that the new amendments to the law will afford it greater enforceability and staying power in their efforts to ban crush videos. Following the Supreme Court's decision, animal rights activists <a href="/hotline/2010/04/stevens-opinion-contains-seeds-of.php">focused</a> on the <a href="/hotline/2010/04/in-wake-of-stevens-decision-congress.php">narrowness</a> of the ruling, as well as the dissent, and <a href="/hotline/2010/04/stevens-court-left-open-issue-of.php">called on</a> [JURIST comments] Congress to revise the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The stay was granted in the case of Private First Class Andrew Holmes of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and allows time for the prosecution and defense to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013484178_soldierhearing21m.html">argue over the release of sealed photographs</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report]. Holmes was charged in June along with <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">Specialist Jeremy Morlock</a> [JURIST report] and three others in relation to the death of an Afghan civilian who was shot in January in Kandahar province. The prosecution alleges that Holmes and the others murdered the man and attempted to make it appear as if he were an enemy combatant. The stay request came during an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00000832----000-.html">Article 32 hearing</a> [10 USC &#167; 832], which will determine if the government has enough evidence to proceed to a court-martial. The photographs, reported to depict Holmes and others posing with the man's body, have been sealed due to concerns that they would incite opposition forces in Afghanistan. The defense <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/20/AR2010112002073.html">claims that the photographs show</a> [AP report] that Holmes did not shoot the man, and argues that refusing to release them violates Holmes' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag2_user.html#amdt6_hd16">Sixth Amendment right to a public trial</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court granted the prosecution 20 days to respond to the defense request, and 14 days following that for the reply from the defense. Holmes has maintained his innocence. 

<p>In late October the Army announced that <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-soldier-to-face-court-martial-for-killing-afghanistan-civilians.php">Morlock would undergo a court-martial</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the death of the Afghan civilian. The Criminal Investigation Division investigation into that civilian death was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">announced in May</a> [JURIST report]. The investigation was the latest into a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In April, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial. In December, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl. Green was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-sentences-ex-us-soldier.php">sentenced to five consecutive life terms</a> [JURIST report] in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECC disqualified the candidates <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/11/20101121151659447105.html">after finding widespread irregularities</a> [Al Jazeera report] in the voting in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. The disqualified candidates comprise almost one-tenth of those elected to the 249-seat <a href="http://wj.parliament.af/english.aspx">Wolesi Jirga</a> [official website], the Afghan Assembly. According to the ECC, the candidates <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g4WGqhY-wbX9AEbIqDiPoAM2h2Sg?docId=CNG.2220387bb052d60699dd2d159d3489ca.541">do not have a right to appeal</a> [AFP report] the decision. With the disqualification of the 21 candidates, it is expected that the ECC will certify the election results within days.

<p>While the ECC has disqualified candidates, the body and the Independent Election Commission face charges of <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-ag-opens-voter-fraud-investigation.php">possible voter fraud</a> [JURIST report]. The IEC was responsible for investigating complaints of voter fraud in the country, and is accused of tampering with the results. The Attorney General's office expressed concern that the IEC did not provide sufficient reason for last month's <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidation of 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], constituting nearly one-fourth of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide.

In April, Afghanistan's President, Hamid Karzai, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/afghanistan-president-accuses-un-eu.php">blamed foreign officials for the extensive irregularities</a> [JURIST report] that occurred during the presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US <a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/">Senator Ron Wyden</a> (D-OR) [official website] stalled a bill on Friday that would allow the federal government to block websites allegedly participating in copyright infringement. The <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/legislation/upload/CombatingOnlineInfringementAndCounterfeitsAct.pdf">Combatting Online Infringement and Counterfeit Act</a> (COICA) [text, PDF] aims to discourage Internet sites dedicated to infringement activities by allowing the Attorney General to petition for injunctive relief against such sites found in both domestic and international domains. Wyden objects to the bill because of the powers it gives the government, powers that the Senator feels may <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/11/20/businessinsider-oregon-senator-spikes-internet-blacklist-bill-2010-11.DTL">result in internet censorship</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report]. If Senator Wyden is successful in stalling the bill until 2011, it will have to be resubmitted to the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] for further consideration. 

<p>The COICA was easily <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/senate-panel-approves-bill-aimed-at-online-piracy.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] with a 19-0 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and has been hailed by the entertainment industry. Conversely, digital rights groups are strongly opposed to the bill, comparing the proposed restrictions to similar <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Internet+ban">Internet restrictions</a> [JURIST news archive] in Turkey and China. The COICA is part of the US initiative to discourage copyright infringement activities and infringement of other intellectual property rights. In October, the <a href="http://ustraderep.gov/">Office of the US Trade Representative</a> (USTR) [official website] and other participating countries <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/nations-unveil-draft-of-international-anti-counterfeiting-pact.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/webfm_send/2338">draft</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2010/acta-fact-sheet-and-guide-public-draft-text">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA) [USTR backgrounder], an international pact to defend intellectual property rights from counterfeit and piracy. The draft was released after <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-european-commission-announce.php">three years</a> [JURIST report] and 10 rounds of negotiations among the ACTA parties. Notably, China, a source of many of the world's counterfeit goods, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6951ZP20101006">is not a participant</a> [Reuters report] in the agreement or discussions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The number of reported incidents was down to 6,604 from 7,783 in 2008, while the number of reported victims was down to 8,336 from 9,691. Of these incidents, 61 percent were against persons, while the remaining percentage were directed towards property, numbers that were consistent with the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/fbi-report-shows-reported-hate-crimes.php">2008 report</a> [JURIST report]. For the both years, more than half of the hate crimes reported were racially motivated, while religious belief was the next largest targeted category. Although there was an increase in the number of federal agencies providing data, preventing an exact comparison of 2008 and 2009 statistics, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] is confident that its increased efforts in investigating hate crimes have brought about positive change. Special Agent Cynthia Deitle, the head of the FBI civil rights program in Washington, DC, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/november/hate_112210/hate_112210">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>During 2010, the FBI devoted additional resources to combat hate crime in those cities most at risk for bias-motivated violence. Working in collaboration with state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as our non-governmental partners, we are confident we can mitigate the risks and impact hate crimes have on individuals and communities.</blockquote>The FBI also cited additions to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:1:./temp/~c110XapnLP::">Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crime Prevention Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=matthew+shepard+act">news archive</a>] as positive improvements that will aid FBI investigation of hate crimes. 

<p>In June, Canadian police reported a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-police-report-35-percent-increase-in-number-of-hate-crimes.php">35 percent increase in hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] from 2007 to 2008. Conversely, Russian racial hate crimes <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">decreased slightly in 2009</a> [JURIST report] because of increased police efforts, according to a report from the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] in January. In December, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official websites] announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/doj-to-increase-enforcement-of-hate.php">increase its efforts to prosecute hate crimes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bemba is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AL2UL20101122">on trial</a> [Reuters report] for charges stemming from his activities as the military leader for the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC). It is alleged that during 2002 and 2003, he committed two crimes against humanity and three war crimes in the territory of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder]. While Bemba pleaded not guilty to all five charges, the prosecutors of the case intend to argue that his failure to control the troops he ordered into the CAR renders him criminally responsible for the rape and other crimes they committed there. Bemba is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/ECAF76D0-A9DF-42A2-9009-F43AB13A77BC.htm">being tried</a> [ICC press release] before three independent magistrates to ensure fairness and expediency. The trial, which had been postponed since April, can be viewed <a href="http://livestream.xs4all.nl/icc1.asx">here</a> [streaming video].

<p>Last week, appellate judges of the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc969582.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] that the trial chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-orders-new-review-of-congo-rebel-leader-bembas-continued-detention----dnp.php">must review</a> [JURIST report] Bemba's continued detention in The Hague. This decision overturned the trial chamber's July <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc914784.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF]. Pursuant to Article 60 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute(e).pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], chambers are obligated to review an accused person's detention once every 120 days. Last month, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc955067.pdf">affirmed</a> [judgment, PDF] a trial chamber ruling and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-allows-trial-of-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to-proceed.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Bemba's appeal challenging the admissibility of his case before the court. The court also concluded that its jurisdiction over the case did not violate a Rome Statute provision that prohibits the ICC from hearing cases after a country has decided not to prosecute the person concerned. The ICC held that the order issued by the CAR did not constitute a decision not to prosecute. In April, Bemba's lawyers argued before the court that charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawyers-for-congo-rebel-leader-bemba.php">should be dropped</a> [JURIST report] because he had been denied due process and the charges were illegal. In addition, defense lawyers claimed that Bemba <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/congo-rebel-leader-bemba-claims-lack-of-funds-precludes-fair-trial.php">lacked the financial resources</a> [JURIST report] necessary to ensure a fair trial. Bemba was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Belgium in May 2008 after the ICC issued a sealed warrant for his arrest. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Aamer, a UK resident, has been held by the US since 2002 on claims that he was fighting with the Taliban. Currently in his ninth year of detainment, the US has yet to charge Aamer with any crime. AI's UK director, Kate Allen, called on Foreign Secretary William Hague and US officials to give a specific timetable for Aamer's release:<blockquote>In the absence of charges or a proper trial we now need to see ... Mr Hague and the US authorities agreeing a specific timetable for Shaker's release. Dealing with what the government calls "legacy issues" in the "war on terror" must mean ensuring justice for Shaker. William Hague should make it a priority that he is returned to his family in Britain. At Amnesty we've always said that where the authorities suspect a person of terrorism they should be charged and given a fair hearing, but Guantanamo Bay has been an utter travesty of justice.</blockquote> Hague and the US have been in discussions over Aamer's release, but no indications of his release have been made. The UK agrees that if Aamer is released, they will be wiling to accept him, as they did with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">former detainee Binyam Mohammed</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Aamer is one of 16 Guantanamo Bay detainees for whom the UK government recently announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] agreement for allegations of torture. Those allegations prompted the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">launch an investigation into torture allegations</a> in May, as well as issue a ruling that state intelligence agencies <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">cannot use secret evidence</a> [JURIST reports] in their defense against abuse. Aamer has been described as an activist within the Guantanamo detention center, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/19/shaker-aamer-guantanamo-torture">negotiating with US military officials</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] over camp conditions and organizing hunger strikes when conditions did not improve. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 directing that the Guantanamo Bay military prison be closed "as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order." Although progress is being made, there are currently 174 men still detained at the facility, the majority of whom have been there for more than eight years without facing charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suspects are charged with hijacking a ship registered in Hamburg off the Horn of Africa and face maximum sentences of between 10 and 15 years in prison. The 10 accused pirates were arrested by the Dutch navy hours after they took over the "Taipan" on April 5. The container ship's crew hid in a panic room on board the ship and avoided capture by the pirates. The case is being <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hN-h7Iv9JheJC3yMnb6YGJH33r1g?docId=CNG.40ccdba1d2b38c4e26b3b463d9579d0d.7f1">held in a juvenile court</a> [AFP report] as some of the accused were under 18 years old at the time of the attack. One individual claims that he was as young as 13, and, in Germany, criminal charges may not be imposed on individuals who are younger than 14. Presiding Judge Bernd Steinmetz instructed the court to assume the youngest pirate was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-22/ten-somalis-are-tried-in-hamburg-court-over-indian-ocean-pirate-attack.html">at least 14 years old</a> [Bloomberg report] at the time of the attack until the issue can be resolved.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] began the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-court-begins-trial-of-accused-somali-pirates.php">first US piracy trial</a> [JURIST report] in more than 100 years. In May, the Netherlands <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Rechtbanken/Rotterdam/">District Court of Rotterdam</a> [official website, in Dutch] initiated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-court-begins-europes-first-somali-pirate-trial.php">first modern European trial</a> [JURIST report] of Somali pirates. The international community has been supporting actions taken against maritime piracy, but the UN has recently had to call for nations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-urges-nations-to-assist-kenya-in-conducting-piracy-trials.php">assist Kenya in conducting piracy trials</a> [JURIST report]. In April, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-security-council-urges-international.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling on member states to criminalize piracy under their domestic laws as well as an announcement from the UN that a trust fund established to combat piracy will be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34472&Cr=somali&Cr1=">funding five projects</a> [UN News Centre report] in an effort to help Somalia and its neighbors reduce acts of piracy committed in nearby bodies of water. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">Kenya</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Suu Kyi asked the court to annul the part of the election law that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">bars political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] from participating in elections and also to establish a parliament of lawmakers who won in the 1990 elections. Suu Kyi originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/suu-kyi-files-suit-in-myanmar-to-stop.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] with the court in April, but her claim was rejected. The dissolution was seen as political move by the military government in order to keep the NLD from participating in Myanmar's 2010 elections, the first in 20 years. Also Monday, reports emerged that Myanmar's government has <a href="http://www.news24.com/World/News/Myanmar-suspends-news-journals-20101122">suspended the publication of nine weekly news journals</a> [News 24 report] that it deemed had given too much coverage to Suu Kyi's recent release from house arrest.

<p>Suu Kyi's visit to the high court last week marked her first visit to Rangoon since the <a href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/ministry/home/MPFmain.htm">Myanmar Police Force</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">released</a> [JURIST report] her after almost eight years of house arrest. Her release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest. Though the challenge was originally scheduled to be heard in October, the court waited until after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to issue its ruling. It is anticipated that Suu Kyi will <a href="http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=20040">assist in a challenge</a> [AP report] against the election results in which the ruling party maintained its hold on power, but the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/8140269/Burma-regime-warns-Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-against-election-challenge.html">military government has warned</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] against any kind of action by the opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to preliminary results, nearly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AL2QX20101122">74 percent of voters approved the constitution</a> [Reuters report], which will keep <a href="http://www.madagascar-presidency.gov.mg/gouvernement/">President Andry Rajoelina</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7943820.stm">profile</a>] in power and allow him to run in the next presidential election scheduled for May 2011. The referendum poll, which had an approximate 53 percent voter turnout, had been overshadowed by strong political protest. On Wednesday, General Noel Rakotonandrasana allegedly led a group of about 20 soldiers into the capital city and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/madagascar-faces-coup-attempt-during-constitutional-referendum.php">tried to take control</a> [JURIST report] of government institutions and seize power from Rajoelina in a failed coup attempt. Former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1866530.stm">Marc Ravalomanana</a> [BBC profile], who was ousted last year by Rajoelina, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gv7H_72esb6E6FEQoGgAJfoNy5bg?docId=CNG.9be0c029adaf0eb4667c81e939f5af84.3c1">supported the military action</a> [AFP report] and saw it as an effort to promote democracy.

<p>Madagascar has faced <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6AG1X920101117?pageNumber=1">ongoing political unrest</a> [Reuters timeline] for almost two years, and Rajoelina's regime has not been recognized by the international community. In August, a Madagascar court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/madagascar-ex-president-sentenced-over-protester-deaths.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Ravalomanana to life in prison with hard labor for ordering the killing of opposition protesters in February 2009. Ravalomanana, who has been living in South Africa since his overthrow in March of last year, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11120620">sentenced <em>in absentia</em></a> [BBC report] on charges of murder and accessory to murder in connection with the deaths of at least 30 people by his presidential guard. Ravalomanana has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madagascar-ex-president-sentenced-in.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three times since he left power, and his lawyer claimed that the trials have been politically motivated to keep him from returning to Madagascar and running for reelection. Earlier in August, the country's political parties <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRL6Pvt4PBw3ERENeLlQjgPHdB-w">gave proposed names</a> [AFP report] for the country's next prime minister to Rajoelina and scheduled last week's constitutional referendum, parliamentary elections in March and a first round of presidential polls next May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

No further details as to his cause of death were released. Kunz, third on the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> [official website] most wanted list, remained free although he admitted to working at Belzec from 1942-1943. Israel Director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Dr. Efraim Zuroff expressed frustration that Kunz was <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441467&ct=8917913">never brought to justice</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The fact that Samuel Kunz lived in Germany unprosecuted for so many decades is the result of a flawed prosecution policy which ignored virtually any Holocaust perpetrator who was not an officer. It was only the recent, long-awaited change in this policy which led to Kunz's indictment and the opportunity to hold him accountable for his crimes. We urge the German authorities to expedite all such cases, given the advanced age of the suspects, so that a measure of justice can still be achieved.</blockquote>Kunz was accused of helping to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/07/2010728132256453542.html">murder 430,000 Jewish people</a> [Al Jazeera report] during his time at Belzec and of shooting 10 other people in separate incidents.

<p>Kunz was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-prosecutor-charges-former-nazi-camp-guard.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in July by prosecutors of the German city of Dortmund. He maintained that he <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/07/28/2740253/germany-charges-90-year-old-in-nazi-era-murders">never personally murdered anyone</a> [JTA report]. Kunz was also called as a witness in the case of fellow accused Nazi war criminal <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>].

<p>The Chinese government has recently focused attention on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">ridding corruption</a> [JURIST news archive] in official channels.

The court <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-22/serbian-court-sentences-two-for-war-crimes-during-bosnian-war.html">sentenced former Zvormik mayor Branko Grujic</a> [Bloomberg report] to six years in prison and former Zvormik local defense chief Branko Popovich to 15 years in prison for their roles in the torture and death of hundreds of Muslims in their hometown during the 1992-1995 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Serbia has undertaken an ongoing effort to apprehend those responsible for the atrocities that occurred in the region over the last two decades. Last month, the Belgrade Appeals Court <a href="/2010/10/serbia-appeals-court-overturns-war-crimes-conviction-of-bosnia-officer.php">overturned the war crimes conviction</a> of former Bosnian officer Ilija Jurisic and ordered a retrial, ruling that the trial court had convicted him on insufficient evidence.

In August, Croatian authorities <a href="/2010/08/croatia-extradites-convicted-djindjic-assassin-to-serbia.php">extradited</a> Sretko Kalinic to Serbia for his alleged connection with the <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/breaking-news-serbian-prime-minister.php">2003 assassination</a> [JURIST reports] of former Serbian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2844081.stm">Zoran Djindjic</a> [BBC obituary; <a href="http://www.zorandjindjic.org/">memorial website</a>, in Serbian]. In July, an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/former-bosnia-president-faces-extradition-from-the-uk.php">extradition hearing</a> [JURIST report] for former Bosnian president Ejup Ganic began in London to determine whether the former leader should be forced to face trial in Serbia for alleged war crimes. The continuing attempt to find all individuals responsible for the atrocities has <a href="/hotline/2010/01/serbias-genocide-suit-against-croatia.php">created a new political tension</a> [JURIST comment] in the region that most believe will not soon go away. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/22/AR2010112204862.html">ruled</a> [AP report] that defendants Charles Steger and former executive vice president James Hyatt are not protected by sovereign immunity because of their status as administrators of a state-funded higher education institution. Visiting judge William Alexander found that, though the positions are partially funded by the state, they do not qualify for sovereign immunity protection as high-ranking government officials, echoing a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/judge-allows-virginia-tech-wrongful.php">similar ruling</a> [JURIST report] made in January. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/families-of-virginia-tech-shooting.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], seeking $10 million in damages, accuses the administrators of gross negligence for failing to warn students of the shootings immediately after the first shooting at 7:15 AM. It is being brought by families of victims Julia Pryde and Erin Petersen who opted out of an <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/judge-approves-11-million-virginia-tech.php">$11 million dollar settlement</a> [JURIST report] to which 24 of the 32 victims' families agreed in June 2008. The trial is set for next September.

<p>The settlement with the other victims' families gave each family $100,000 plus medical expenses and provided for meetings with Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech administration and police officials. Many of the families in the settlement had considered wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits against the state of Virginia after an independent state panel reported that different school policies could have avoided some of the deaths, but the settlement terms required the families to release their claims. In December 2007, Congress <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/congress-passes-bill-closing-gun.php">passed by voice vote</a> an act that closes a <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/virgina-tech-gunman-prohibited-by.php">loophole</a> [JURIST report] that allowed Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho to purchase firearms despite a court order mandating psychiatric treatment. The Virginia Tech shootings left 33 people dead and 25 wounded in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/vatechshootings/?sid=ST2008061701801">deadliest shooting incident in US history</a> [WP backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Vicki Miles-LeGrange said she <a href="http://www.koco.com/r/25870985/detail.html">needed more time</a> [KOCO report] to deal with this issue, which pits the will of the voters against the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Still, she is expected to rule by the end of the month. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-islamic-law-ban-challenged.php">case was brought</a> [JURIST report] by Muneer Awad, executive director of <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] in Oklahoma, claiming the law is a violation of the First Amendment because it disfavors and stigmatizes his religion. Oklahoma voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">overwhelmingly approved the measure</a> [JURIST report] in the November 2 mid-term elections with 70 percent of the vote.

<p>Miles-LeGrange <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-islamic-law-ban-challenged.php">issued the temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] just six days after the election, stopping the Oklahoma <a href="http://www.ok.gov/elections/">Board of Elections</a> [official website] from certifying the results. SQ 755 would prevent Oklahoma courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures," requiring them only to look to legal precedents of other states for guidance, provided that state does not use Islamic law. It was sponsored by state <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/committees/member.aspx?memberid=54">Representative Rex Duncan</a> (R) [official website], who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">described it as a preemptive strike</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma. Duncan defended SQ 755 as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybvivrs_MH0">necessary to protect Oklahoma</a> [MSNBC report, video] from an attack on the fundamental Judeo-Christian principles on which he says the US is founded. On the other hand, <a href="http://themaydan.org/bios.html">Haroon Moghul</a> [profile] Executive Director of the <a href="http://themaydan.org/index.html">Maydan Institute</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="/hotline/2010/11/oklahoma-ban-of-sharia-deems-Islam-as-un-american.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the passage of SQ 755 was done simply out of the "flawed logic" of a fear of everything Muslim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Asia Bibi, a mother of four, is the first woman to be sentenced to death under the blasphemy law, and her case has sparked international outrage and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/22/AR2010112202000.html">demands for her release</a> [AP report]. Pakistani <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/PressRoomInformationDetail.aspx?ID=1054">ordered a review</a> [press release] and may use his constitutional authority to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11818930">pardon her</a> [BBC report]. Critics of the laws believe they have been used as a means of discrimination and inciting violence. In its statement, HRW called on the Pakistani government to take action against Islamic militant groups who are targeting minority religions:<blockquote>Legal discrimination against religious minorities and the failure of Pakistan's federal and provincial governments to address religious persecution by Islamist groups effectively enables atrocities against these groups and others who are vulnerable. The government seldom brings charges against those responsible for such violence and discrimination. Research by Human Rights Watch indicates that the police have not apprehended anyone implicated in such activity in the last several years.</blockquote>The blasphemy laws were <a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=16718">introduced in 1986</a> [AsiaNews report] as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults. In response to the repeated calls for repeal, Pakistani <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Mom/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNLE_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIo_LBEMTfT-P_NxU_YLs7DRHR0VFAGW7A9Q!/dl2/d1/L0lDU0lKSWdrbUEhIS9JRFJBQUlpQ2dBek15cXchL1lCSkoxTkExTkk1MC01RncvN19VRkpQQ0dDMjBPVVFFMDJFVDlGTVBKMzBPMC9Ga19fXzE3/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_UFJPCGC20OUQE02ET9FMPJ30O0_WCM&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MomCL/ministry/about/minister">Federal Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti</a> [official profile] said the laws <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/11/23/pakistan-will-not-repeal-blasphemy-law-govt-minister/">may be amended</a> [Reuters report] to prevent misuse, but they will not be repealed. 

<p>In May, the <a href="http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php?cur_t=vnormal">Pakistan Telecommunications Authority</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/pakistan-government-blocks-facebook-over-mohammed-drawing-competition.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Internet service providers to <a href="http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1390&Itemid=301">block</a> [press release] social networking site <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website] in response to a competition created by a group of the website's members entitled "Draw Muhammad Day." The PTA issued the order following a decision by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lahore+high+court">Lahore High Court</a> (LHC) [JURIST news archive] to block the website indefinitely. Depicting the Prophet Muhammad is considered blasphemous by Muslims, and has been a source of international controversy since 2005 when a Danish newspaper published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=danish+cartoon">series of cartoons</a> [JURIST news archive]. In February, Shahbaz Bhatti told the Agence France-Presse that he has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-to-revise-blasphemy-laws.php">speaking to various political parties</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan and that his government is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gN_fU6rinxd4J-egRTpxlQrY5sdA">committed to doing away with laws</a> [AP report] that are discriminatory to minorities. Bhatti made the comments at an interview with the AFP in Washington, DC, where he met with various lawmakers and officials during the National Prayer Breakfast. Bhatti discussed a proposed change in the law that would force judges to investigate blasphemy cases before they are docketed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 5-4 vote, the court found that the <a href="http://volokh.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Maynard.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] filed by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General</a> [official website] did not overcome the limitations of the automobile exception to the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] warrant requirement. The court further rejected the argument that its <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">previous ruling</a> [JURIST report] frustrated the common practices sustained in visual and photographic surveillance of public places. Rather, the court noted that "this case does not require us to ... decide whether a hypothetical instance of prolonged visual surveillance would be a search subject to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment." Chief Judge David Sentelle dissented, claiming that the court was ignoring precedent established by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2281447873975736215&q=460+U.S.+276&hl=en&as_sdt=8000000002">United States v.

The three-judge panel had distinguished the present case because too much personal information is revealed over longer periods of GPS surveillance. 

<p>Courts have struggled with how to apply Fourth Amendment protections to modern technology. In September, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that at times the government might need a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">warrant to obtain cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. In June, the US Supreme Court unanimously <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an employer's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">search of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. Last year, the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2009/2009-Ohio-6426.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that police must <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">obtain a warrant before searching data stored in a cell phone</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 65-33 vote, the legislature decided that a <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_PALESTINIANS?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">referendum would be required</a> [AP report] for any agreement involving the surrender of annexed land that fails to win a two-thirds majority in parliament. The legislation would apply to possible peace deals that include withdrawal from the Golan Heights or East Jerusalem, territories annexed in 1967. Under the new bill, a two-thirds Knesset majority vote would be required to cede land in East Jerusalem to the Palestinians or in the Golan Heights to Syria. Otherwise, either withdrawal would become subject to a national referendum. Tzipi Livni, the head of the opposition Kadima party, and Anat Wilf of the Labour party, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/11/23/israel.referendum.bill/?hpt=T2">opposed the bill</a> [CNN report], which is supported by <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website].

The court's decision overturned the <a href="http://www.gaappeals.us/">Georgia Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruling denying the defendant's motion for a new trial. Annie Ling, whose native language is Mandarin Chinese, filed the motion after a jury convicted her of cruelty to children in the first degree. Ling argued that her trial counsel failed to secure an interpreter for trial, instead relying on her husband to help convey a last minute plea agreement offer. The court held that lack of an interpreter can impede a defendant's right to be present at trial in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause</a> [texts] of the US Constitution. The court held that "when a question is raised in a motion for new trial as to whether a criminal defendant's due process rights have been violated by the absence of a qualified interpreter, the trial court must make and explain its findings on the issue on the record." The court remanded the case to the trial court in order for a finding of fact regarding Ling's claim regarding the trial counsel's failure to convey the prosecution's final plea agreement offer.

<p>Rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] have spoken out in support of court interpreters for defendants with limited English proficiency. The ACLU, which submitted a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-5-28-LingvGeorgia-AmicusBrief.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] on behalf of Ling, released a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/court-rules-defendants-limited-english-proficiency-have-constitutional-right-court">statement</a> [press release] Monday applauding the court's decision. In response to the decision, Azadeh Shahshahani, Director of the National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project at the ACLU of Georgia said, "The constitutional guarantee of due process applies to everyone in this country, not just fluent English-speakers." The ACLU has <a href="http://acluva.org/5686/rights-groups-and-residents-of-virginia-urge-dhs-to-reject-statewide-287g-program/">also opposed</a> [press release] a <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB1338">bill</a> [text] voted on by the Virginia legislature which would require non-English speaking defendants to pay for interpreters at their criminal trials. The bill passed the House but was halted by the Senate's Committee for Courts of Justice. <br />

Pillay expressed particular concern for Nasrin Sotoudeh, the human rights lawyer who has been <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11699603">conducting hunger strikes</a> [BBC report] since her <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-detained.php">imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] in September for allegedly spreading propaganda and colluding against national security.

Pillay called for Sotoudeh's release:<blockquote>As we approach international Human Rights Day on 10 December, the world will be focusing on situations where human rights activists are not free to organize or speak out. I am very concerned that Nasrin Sotoudeh's case is part of a much broader crackdown, and that the situation of human rights defenders in Iran is growing more and more difficult. ... I urge the Iranian authorities to review her case urgently and expedite her release.</blockquote>Pillay also noted that, "[f]reedom of speech and freedom of assembly are enshrined in international law, most importantly in the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], which is a binding treaty that Iran has ratified." Next week, the <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] will conduct a judicial colloquium in Tehran to instruct 30 Iranian judges and prosecutors on correct treatment of detainees, as well as how to conduct fair trials.

<p>Pillay previously <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-chief-criticizes-iran-sri.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Iran's human rights record in March while presenting her annual report.

Iran <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/iran-defends-human-rights-record-before.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its human rights record to the UN in February. Sotoudeh worked on several high-profile cases related to the 2009 presidential election. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of mohareb, translated as being "enemies of God." Rahmanipour was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January. Sotoudeh also represented <a href = "http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [IPS profile], a well-known press activist who was <a href = "/paperchase/2006/08/iran-court-sentences-outspoken-editor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to four years in prison in 2006 for publishing articles against the constitution and offending the state media.

In total, the judges <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112302458.html">rejected 23 petitions</a> [WP report], including motions regarding whether Demjanjuk, who is Ukranian born but obtained US citizenship after World War II, is fit for trial. His family and physician argue that Demjanjuk, who is 90 years old, is too frail and in too much pain to make it through the trial. "While they silence the prison doctors and deny us the weekly clinical reports - against all Western legal and humanitarian standards - the judges rely on a court appointed medical stooge whose therapy is to shoot my father with various drugs and call him fit," Demanjanjuk's son, John Jr., said in statement appended to his father's. John Demjanjuk Sr. said, "The decision to continue with this trial is a crime of infringement of the law and a deprivation of my liberty. With this statement, I bring a charge against Judges Alt, Lenz and Pfluger for infringement of the law and deprivation of my liberty. I ask that my statement be provided to the authorities who must investigate and decide to take action regarding this serious charge."

<p>In May, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">refused to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the charges against Demjanjuk , although his defense lawyers claimed there was a lack of evidence. It is alleged that Demjanjuk <a href="http://www.abendzeitung.de/muenchen/92205">volunteered to work at Sobibor</a> [Abendzeitung report, in German] after being captured by German forces while serving as a member of the Soviet army. Multiple appeals were filed in regards to Demjanjuk's health, but he was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a>, and his appeals were <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] in October 2009. Demjanjuk's <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] last November, but the hearings have been limited to no more than two-90 minute sessions per day in deference to his health. Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/accused-nazi-guard-deported-to-germany.php">deported to Germany</a> [JURIST report] from the US in May 2009. According to a leaked Department of Justice <a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/confidential-report-provides-new-evidence-of-notorious-nazi-cases?ref=us#p=1">report</a> [text], the US acted as a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/leaked-doj-report-reveals-nazi-safe-havens-in-us.php">safe harbor for Nazis</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/forum/2010/11/us-inaction-aiding-and-abetting-nazis-after-the-fact.php">commentary</a>] after World War II.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-court-sentences-saddam-era-deputy-pm-aziz-to-death.php">sentenced to death by hanging</a> [JURIST report] last month by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/review-862-p399/$File/irrc_862_Newton.pdf">Iraqi High Criminal Court</a> [ICRC backgrounder, PDF] following a conviction on charges related to the former regime's effort to eliminate Shiite Muslim resistance efforts after the First Gulf War.  The petition filed by Giovanni Di Stefano attacks the conviction, citing a failure to prove the crime:<blockquote>Under normal circumstances and in any other judicial systems operative in a democratic country under the criminal law the basis for a conviction is based upon 'beyond reasonable doubt.' In civil law it is 'on the balance of probabilities.'  In Iraq a judge has to be simply 'satisfied' of the evidence and that is by far from any international standards which the Constitution of Iraq requires.</blockquote>The petition notes that Aziz was convicted under Article 406 of the Iraqi Penal Code which requires that a person "willfully kills" and points to the prosecution's assertion that "Mr Aziz was a member of the ruling party and that he did not object or supported the decision to persecute members of the Da'wa Party and the killing of Mr Al Sadre." The petition concludes that the prosecution did not meet their required burden of proof and asks Talabani to issue a pardon citing Article 73 of the<a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf"> Iraqi Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which gives the president the power to "issue a special pardon on the recommendation of the Prime Minister."  The petition argues the power to pardon can be used "unilaterally and without prior motion," however, that <a href="http://www.arabmonitor.info/news/dettaglio.php?idnews=32198&lang=en">proposition is disputed</a> [Arab Monitor report]. Current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki represents the Shia Da'wa party that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hzlOtpV2sm0fBwlH-7jWwrO6vAJw?docId=N0209021290437535934A">Aziz was convicted of persecuting</a> [UKPA report].

<p>The petition follows pressure from the Vatican and various European countries opposed to the death penalty.  On Wednesday, Talabani said in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEmA6AxOhgM">interview </a>[video] that he will not sign the execution order for Aziz, citing his opposition to capital punishment.  Talabani also indicated that he felt compassion for Aziz who is a Christian and an old man. Aziz's family has called for his release on health grounds, claiming he has had two heart attacks and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/imprisoned-saddam-era-iraqi-foreign.php">suffered a stroke</a> [JURIST report] in January. In August 2009, Aziz was convicted of <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-court-convicts-top-saddam.php">forcing Kurdish displacement</a> [JURIST report] from northeast Iraq during the late 1980s, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Prior to his March conviction, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the 1999 killing of protesters who rioted in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr.<br />

Anwar filed suit in 2006 after Mahathir allegedly suggested at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. His suit was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/malaysia-judge-rejects-anwar-defamation.php">dismissed</a> by the Federal Court in 2007, and an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/malaysia-appeals-court-dismisses-former.php">rejected</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-malaysia-deputy-pm-appeals.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports] last year. The Federal Court upheld that ruling Wednesday, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-8R1YBLnM-ZzZ4hDBmhB36kCZcw?docId=CNG.b9563120a4c64fddca80a6a945060645.811">fining Anwar</a> [AFP report] 70,000 ringgit (USD $22,320) for legal costs. Anwar, who served as deputy premier under Mahathir until 1998, had previously sued Mahathir for defamation in 1999, but the case was rejected at the time as "unsustainable."

<p>Anwar is currently facing trial on charges of sodomizing his former aide Mohamad Saiful Bukhari Azlan in 2008. He has described the charges as a farce aimed at preventing him from taking his seat in <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/eng-index.php">Parliament</a> [official website] following gains made by his party in the 2008 elections. He <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-opposition-leader-enters-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in February. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the Malaysian government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/malaysia-urged-to-drop-sodomy-charges.php">drop all charges</a> [JURIST report] against Anwar. HRW alleges that the trial has been "plagued by serious due process problems and government interference" and that the government should therefore drop all charges against Anwar. Earlier that month, the Malaysian Federal Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/malaysia-appeals-court-rules-opposition.php">rejected</a> Anwar's <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">claim</a> [JURIST reports] that his 1998 removal from office was unconstitutional. He recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The trial began in September and had already been postponed due to alleged ethnic violence against the defendants' families. Lawyers for the Uzbek men said that they will appeal the conviction.

Two others were sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the last was sentenced to nine. Among those given life sentences was prominent Uzbek human rights activist Azimjan Askarov. The convictions were later described as <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51515820100915">politically motivated</a> [Reuters report].

The ruling was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juw4OCsGEMajdlq9TdgsaCaK4XcA?docId=CNG.e713b74f11e700b9b9cc9978ac3db0ec.771">welcomed</a> [AFP report] by environmental groups such as <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/">Greenpeace</a> [advocacy website], but the German Farmer's Association said that the risk of financial liability was too great and warned against planting GM crops.

<p>Courts and legislatures around the world have struggled with the increasingly prevalent issue of GM crops. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]  <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-475.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-injunction-against-genetically-modified-seed.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-475">Monsanto Company v. Geerston Seed Farms</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a trial court abused its discretion when it issued a nationwide injunction against a genetically modified alfalfa seed. The trial court sought to remedy a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] violation based on only a remote possibility of reparable harm. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/24/07-16458.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that NEPA plaintiffs are specially exempt from the requirement of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to obtain an injunction, affirming the nationwide injunction. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the opinion of the court, reversed the circuit court's ruling, stating that NEPA violations, absent unusual circumstances, are not exempt from the standard four-factor test to determine the availability of injunctive relief. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/43809545-Witt-Notice-of-Appeal.pdf">appealed</a> [text, PDF] the reinstatement order Wednesday, although the government has commented that the <a href="http://metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/11/breaking-doj-to-appeal-witt-re.html">appeal is standard procedure</a> [Metro Weekly report] and does not lessen President Barack Obama's commitment to repealing the policy. In September, Judge Ronald Leighton of the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] relied on testimony regarding Witt's exemplary record in finding that her sexual orientation did not hinder her unit, and that she should be <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">returned to duty</a> [JURIST report] as soon as possible. The Washington chapter of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has been representing Witt and struggling to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/air-force-major-dismissed-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-rejoin-military">secure her reinstatement</a> [press release] for the past four years. Witt worked for almost 20 years as a military flight nurse and received numerous honors and medals for her service before she was discharged under the DADT policy when authorities discovered that she had been in a long-term relationship with a civilian woman. 

<p>The Obama administration <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/US-response-10A465-11-10-10.pdf">filed a brief</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-not-to-block-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] earlier this month asking the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] not to rescind the stay preventing suspension of the military's DADT policy. The filing was in response to a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DADT-10A465-vacate-application.pdf">petition filed a week earlier</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-asks-supreme-court-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> [advocacy website] asking the court to overturn the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">indefinite extension</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-temporarily-blocks-suspension-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. The government asked the court not to interrupt the policy while it is being considered in lower courts. The filing noted that Obama and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] oppose the policy, but also stressed their support for the repeal of the policy through legislative measures, citing the need for deliberation, advance planning and training before transitioning from the 17-year-old policy. Also this month, Gates called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report], and, in October, he issued a memorandum <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior Department of Defense officials. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were found guilty on charges of piracy, attacking to plunder a maritime vessel and assault with a dangerous weapon for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols, which was deployed to combat piracy in waters off the eastern coast of Africa. They were <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-prosecutors-indict-11-suspected.php">charged by a federal grand jury</a> in April, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/eleven-accused-somali-pirates-plead-not-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July. They face mandatory life sentences at a sentencing hearing scheduled for March 14.

<p>Several other nations have also been conducting piracy trials. Earlier this week, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">German court began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 10 suspected Somali pirates in that country's first piracy trial in 400 years. Last month, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Yemeni court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a group of 10 Somali pirates to five years in prison. Recently, the high court of Mombasa ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-court-rules-no-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenya does not have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] outside of its national waters, releasing nine suspected Somali pirates. The ruling could have implications for future piracy prosecutions, as Kenyan courts have handled the bulk of piracy trials. Other nations that have conducted such trials include the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-court-begins-europes-first-somali-pirate-trial.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Vielmann has been <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/20/internacional/1290253967.html">imprisoned in Spain</a> [<em>El Mundo</em> report, in Spanish] since his arrest in Madrid last month, and was to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306673.html">extradited on charges</a> [AP report] that he ordered the extrajudicial execution of seven inmates at the Pavon prison near Guatemala City in 2006. The <a href="http://www.cicig.org/">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/guatemala-corruption-commission-issues-arrest-warrants-for-former-officials.php">issued the warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Vielmann's arrest in August, along with warrants for other former Guatemalan officials in its continued effort to end criminal impunity and dismantle illegal security groups there. Vielmann maintains that the inmates died in their attempt to fight against the invasion of thousands of police officers and soldiers seeking to regain control of the prison. 

<p>Official corruption has long been a problem in Guatemala, and there has been recent disagreement over whether CICIG is serving its purpose, with some arguing that it has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/11/14/general-lt-guatemala-war-on-impunity_8103611.html">overstepped its mandate</a> [AP report]. However, the commission has been busy prosecuting alleged criminals. In June, the <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Guatemalan Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/guatemala-high-court-removes-attorney-general.php">removed</a> Attorney General Conrado Reyes from office after the former head of CICIG, Carlos Castresana, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/head-of-un-guatemala-anti-corruption-commission-resigns.php">accused him of ties to organized crime</a> [JURIST reports]. In March, following an 11-month investigation with CICIG, Guatemalan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/top-guatemala-police-officials-arrested.php">arrested two high-ranking police officials</a> [JURIST report] tasked with leading the country's war on drugs on charges of corruption and drug trafficking. Also in March, the US State Department released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/137411.pdf">2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report</a> [text, PDF], which highlighted Guatemala as a key player in the Latin American drug trade. Corruption among high-ranking officials was cited as one of the country's biggest problems. The Guatemalan Congress <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/guatemala-congress-establishes-body-to.php">voted to create CICIG</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 in order to investigate organized crime and official corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stemmed from $190,000 donated by corporate interests to DeLay's political action committee (PAC) during the 2002 midterm election, which was allegedly funneled through the <a href="http://www.gop.com/">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC) [party website] for use in state elections. The RNC then distributed the money to seven legislative candidates at DeLay's direction in order to circumvent a <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/EL/15/253/D/253.094">state election law</a> [Tex. Elec. Code &#167; 253.094] forbidding corporate contributions to political campaigns, according to prosecutors.

DeLay maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, calling the trial both an <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101125/ap_on_re_us/us_delay_trial">abuse of power and a miscarriage of justice</a> [AP report].

<p>In August, DeLay's lawyer confirmed that a US Department of Justice (DOJ) criminal probe into DeLay's association with lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive] had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/doj-ends-delay-criminal-probe-without-filing-charges.php">dismissed without charges being filed</a> [JURIST report]. The investigation lasted six years and included grand jury testimony from former aides as well as a review of more than 1,000 documents and e-mails from DeLay's office. In August 2008, a Texas appeals court allowed the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-appellate-court-refuses-to.php">money laundering indictment</a> [JURIST report] against DeLay's associates to stand. In 2007, a Texas appeals court ruled against reinstating a charge of conspiracy to violate the state's election law against DeLay and his two associates. After he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/breaking-news-delay-indicted-for-money.php">indicted</a>, DeLay <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/delay-steps-down-as-house-majority.php">stepped down as House majority leader</a> and later <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/delay-to-resign-from-congress-as-legal.php">resigned from Congress</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The call was prompted by the release of <a href="http://www.the-monitor.org/lm/2010">"Landmine Monitor 2010"</a> [materials], an annual report detailing the treaty's progress released by the <a href="http://www.icbl.org/intro.php">International Campaign to Ban Landmines</a> (ICBL) [advocacy website]. The 2010 report shows international progress in preventing deaths from landmines, as well as in eradicating their use. HRW criticized the US government's stance on the issue while noting that it, along with almost all 37 states who have not joined the treaty, "are in de facto compliance with most of the treaty's provisions." HRW stated:<blockquote>The US should not be on the outside looking in at the most successful humanitarian and disarmament treaty of the past decade. The Obama administration has been pondering the Mine Ban Treaty for more than a year now. It's time to make the right decision.</blockquote> The US State Department said last November that the US would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-will-not-become-party-to-anti.php">maintaining its current policy</a> [JURIST report], with spokesperson Ian Kelly <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2009/nov/132362.htm">stating</a> [text] that "[the Obama administration] ... determined that we would not be able to meet our national defense needs, nor our security commitments to our friends and allies if we sign this convention." Despite this, the US government sent representatives to the December 2009 convention of state parties, where it announced that US landmine policy was under review. US representatives will attend the <a href="http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Treaties/MBT/Annual-Meetings/10MSP">Tenth Meeting of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty</a> [summit website], convening in Geneva next week.

<p>The US is one of only two countries in the western hemisphere that is not a party to the treaty. The treaty currently has 156 state parties worldwide, with two additional signatories who have not ratified the treaty. In 2004, the Bush administration <a href = "http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=3218&programID=89&from_page=../friendlyversion/printversion.cfm">geared US policy away</a> [CDI backgrounder] from signing the mine treaty and substituted usage of persistent mines with non-persistent mines. The Clinton administration did not sign the Mine Ban Treaty, but in 1998 issued <a href = "http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd-64.htm">Presidential Decision Directive 64</a> [FAS backgrounder], instructing the US military to explore alternate weapons and outlining US commitment to sign the treaty by 2006. The treaty opened for signature in December 1997, and signatory countries <a href = "http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Treaties/MBT/Treaty-Basics">ban the use</a> [ICBL backgrounder] of anti-personnel mines, destroy stockpiles and take measures towards clearing mines, as well as help countries with fewer resources clear mines and give assistance to victims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A Spanish judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/spain-judge-orders-release-of-guatemalas-former-interior-minister.php">ordered Vielmann's release</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday after Guatemalan authorities failed to request his extradition to face charges before the <a href="http://www.cicig.org/">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website, in Spanish]. Guatemalan authorities were accused of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gs3lH2KBhOjZP5HdXoIvIiR_JPFw?docId=5548696965b74c64a7bc8c6722584caa">purposely frustrating these efforts</a> [AP report] by CICIG head Francisco Dall'Anese, who alleged that the Foreign Ministry had withheld papers necessary to the extradition for two weeks without reason. The ministry responded by insisting that it had "complied with all terms and acted promptly in the extradition process." It went on to state that the delay was due to the need to obtain the necessary signatures from the Spanish embassy, and the extradition papers were held by the ministry for only three days. The request process was then suspended in compliance with an <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=317:exp-4136-2010-de-fecha-18-11-2010&catid=49:casentencias&Itemid=73">order</a> [text, in Spanish] to do so by the Guatemalan <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish]. The Guatemalan government has until December 13 to request the extradition, but Dall'Anese expressed skepticism at the prospects of this.

<p>The arrest warrant was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/guatemala-corruption-commission-issues-arrest-warrants-for-former-officials.php">issued in August</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the extrajudicial execution of seven inmates at the Pavon prison in 2006. Vielmann has maintained his innocence, contending that the inmates died in a prison riot. Official corruption has been an ongoing problem in Guatemala. In June, the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/guatemala-high-court-removes-attorney-general.php">removed</a> Attorney General Conrado Reyes from office after the former head of CICIG, Carlos Castresana, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/head-of-un-guatemala-anti-corruption-commission-resigns.php">accused him of ties to organized crime</a> [JURIST reports]. In March, the US State Department released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/137411.pdf">2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report</a> [text, PDF], which highlighted Guatemala as a key player in the Latin American drug trade. Corruption among high-ranking officials was cited as one of the country's biggest problems. The Guatemalan Congress <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/guatemala-congress-establishes-body-to.php">voted to create CICIG</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 in order to investigate organized crime and official corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The CJA is <a href="http://cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=412">seeking disciplinary action</a> [CJA backgrounder] against New York licensed psychologist Dr. John Leso, including revocation of his license to practice psychology, based on techniques he developed while leading a behavioral science consultation team at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2002 and 2003. In July, the CJA filed a <a href="http://cja.org/downloads/Leso%20Complaint.Final.07.07.2010.pdf">licensing complaint</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.op.nysed.gov/">New York Office of the Professions</a> (NYOP) [official website] against Leso requesting an immediate investigation of his conduct, as well as acts committed by interrogators following his recommendations and under his supervision at Guantanamo Bay. The NYOP <a href="http://cja.org/downloads/No.%202.%20NYOP%20Denial%20of%20Jurisdiction.7.28.10.pdf">denied jurisdiction</a> [ruling, PDF] over the complaint on the grounds that Leso's conduct was not consistent with the practice of psychology as defined under New York law, and therefore was not governed by New York rules of professional ethics.

<p>This complaint is the most recent in the history of condemnations of Guantanamo Bay medical professionals. In April 2009, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList2/Home?OpenDocument">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [official website] reported that medical professionals <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/red-cross-report-alleges-guantanamo.php">violated codes of medical ethics</a> [JURIST report] by participating in and assisting in ill-treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees. A 2008 <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/phrbrokenlaws.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="/pdf/phrbrokenlawssummary.pdf">executive summary</a>, PDF] by the <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians For Human Rights</a> [official website] revealed that abuse and torture claims made by former detainees held by the US in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and Iraq are <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doctors-examine-ex-detainees-find.php">supported by medical examinations</a> [JURIST report] performed by the group. Doctors from 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/doctors-attack-unethical-medical.php">wrote a letter</a> [JURIST report] in September 2007 condemning the US military for its treatment of detainees, particularly the policy of force-feeding to counteract hunger strikes. A month earlier, a <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/298/5/563">commentary</a> [text] published in the <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> [journal website] asserted that force-feeding was a <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/doctors-say-guantanamo-force-feeding.php">violation of medical ethics</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Swedish appeals court additionally shortened their prison sentences from one year to between four and ten months but increased the damages owed to the entertainment industry to 46M kronor (US$6.5M). A fourth co-founder, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, still awaits an appeal due to illness. All four men deny the charges against them, claiming not to have broken Swedish copyright laws because The Pirate Bay does not actually host any copyrighted material. Instead, they claim their site simply provides a forum for the transfer of <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent.htm/printable">BitTorrent files</a> [backgrounder], a system that allows users to transfer large files from several users for faster downloading times. The site still remains in operation, despite Swedish authorities' efforts to shut it down. Neji plans to appeal to the Swedish Supreme Court. 

<p>In June of 2009, several <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/hollywood-companies-file-suit-against.php">Hollywood production companies filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in Sweden against the operators of The Pirate Bay, seeking an injunction.

The eleven were found guilty of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101127/wl_africa_afp/egyptvoteislam">taking part in election demonstrations</a> [AFP report] and campaigning for Muslim Brotherhood using leaflets that contained religious slogans.  On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] expressed concern regarding the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/24/egypt-systematic-crackdown-days-elections">crackdown of opposition parties</a> [press release] ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. The Egyptian government passed constitutional amendments in 2007 that have severely limited independent judicial supervision.  Muslim Brotherhood members are contesting for 30 percent of the seats in the People's Assembly as independents.  Abdelmoneim Maqsud, Muslim Brotherhood's chief lawyer, told HRW that security forces have arrested 1,306 members, and have brought 702 members before prosecutors. 

<p>The Muslim Brotherhood has previously been targeted by the Egyptian government.  In April, Attorney General Abdul Magid Mahmoud announced that five international MB members will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/egypt-court-to-try-muslim-brotherhood.php">tried in an Egyptian criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on charges of money laundering.  Egypt has also used the emergency laws extensively against other opposition parties.  In July 2009, the trial of 26 individuals with alleged ties to Hezbollah was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/egypt-to-try-26-hezbollah-linked-terror.php">transferred to a court</a> [JURIST report] established under the emergency laws.  In February 2009, a military court utilized the laws during a trial in which it <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-court-imprisons-opposition-leader.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] opposition leader Magdy Ahmed Hussein to two years in prison. The emergency laws have been in effect continuously since the 1981 assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/egypt-parliament-extends-state-of-emergency.php">renewed</a> [JURIST report] most recently in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Fletcher Dawson <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/Toronto+terrorist+gets+years+jail/3892968/story.html">handed down</a> [<em>National Post</em> report] the sentence, which is greater than the eight years advocated by the defense, but Chand, who has been in prison since 2006, was <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/11/26/toronto-18-sentence.html">credited for time served</a> [CBC report] and will only serve another seven months and 10 days. Chand was previously <a href="http://www.ppsc-sppc.gc.ca/eng/nws-nvs/comm/2010/23_06_10.html">found guilty</a> [press release] of "participation in a terrorist group" and "counseling to commit fraud over $5,000 for the benefit of a terrorist group," which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, after attempting to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/06/23/toronto-18-verdict.html">take out fraudulent bank loans</a> [CBC report] in order to support the group. Both sides have 30 days to appeal the sentence. 

<p>Last month, the court also <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ontario-court-sentences-convicted-toronto-18-leader-to-16-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Fahim+Ahmad">Fahim Ahmad</a> [JURIST news archive], the leader of the "Toronto 18", to 16 years in prison for his role in the terrorist organization. Ahmad's sentence was greater than the 12 years suggested by the defense but less than the 18 years requested by the <a href="http://www.ppsc-sppc.gc.ca/eng/">Public Prosecution Service of Canada</a> (PPSC) [official website]. The sentence follows an unanticipated change to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/accused-toronto-18-leader-pleads-guilty-mid-trial.php">guilty plea mid-trial</a> [JURIST report] in May. In February, Toronto 18 member Shareef Abdelhaleem was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-judge-convicts-toronto-18-member.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] after a Canadian judge found that virtually no evidence existed to support his claims of entrapment. In January, Amin Mohamed Durrani was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/toronto-18-member-released-after.php">released</a> [JURIST report] after pleading guilty to participating in and assisting a terrorist group. Also in January, a Canadian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-toronto-18.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two members of the group, Zakaria Amara and <a href="/forumy/2008/04/toronto-18-terrorism-case-no-trial-by.php">Saad Gaya</a> [JURIST op-ed], to life and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in the plot.

The Court reversed the decision of the appellate court by finding that during their investigation of a citizen for the possible existence of marijuana farms, the police did not violate the citizen&#8217;s rights by enlisting his electric company to monitor unusual patterns that could indicate illegal activities. The court held that the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/UpdateNotice/index.html?rp14=%2Feng%2FConst%2FConst_index.html">Constitution</a> [text] "does not cloak the home in an impenetrable veil of privacy," and that it would be both impractical and unreasonable to expect otherwise. It added:<blockquote>Also noteworthy here is that the home itself was never directly the object of a search. The location where the search took place was not the home but the transformer box where the power lines entering the home could be accessed. After some confusion in the courts below about whether the transformer was located on Mr. Gomboc&#8217;s property, it was common ground before this Court that it was not.  Accordingly, no direct territorial privacy interest is engaged in this case.</blockquote>The dissent argued that when a citizen gives a utility company access to information such as electricity use, he does so only under the condition that it is used for service purposes only, and kept private from other parties, including the government.

<p>Earlier this year, Canada launched legal probes to investigate privacy violations of both <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-launches-legal-probe-into-google-privacy-violations.php">Google</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-privacy-commissioner-launches.php">Facebook</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this week, a US appeals court allowed a previous ruling against prolonged surveillance with global positioning systems (GPS) <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-ruling-against-warrantless-gps-tracking-to-stand.php">to stand</a> [JURIST report]. In August, the court ruled that prolonged monitoring of a suspect's GPS data violates his Fourth Amendment <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">protection against unreasonable search and seizure</a> [JURIST report]. The appellate court found that there exists a reasonable expectation of privacy in the "whole of a person's movements over the course of a month" because the combination of all such movements is not actually or constructively exposed to the public. The decision adds to a split among appellate courts on the issue, although the court noted that decisions to the contrary "were not alert to the distinction ... between short-term and prolonged surveillance" in the relevant precedent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reports <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40403749/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/">have surfaced</a> [AP report] of vote buying and the ejection of independent vote monitors from polling locations. The ruling <a href="http://www.ndp.org.eg/en/Index.aspx">National Democratic Party</a> (NDP) has taken tough measures to hold onto its control of the 508-seat <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/English/default.htm">Egyptian Parliament</a> [official websites]. The NDP <a href="http://www.ndp.org.eg/en/News/ViewNewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=74777">denies</a> [press release] the problems, saying that they are from &#8220;an outlawed group of people try[ing] to stifle the positive indications of the elections by spreading rumors about the whole process.&#8221; On Friday, eleven people <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/egypt-court-sentences-11-for-religious-election-campaigning.php">were found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of taking part in election demonstrations and campaigning for the banned <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>], the only legitimate opposition party threat. At least 1,200 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested during the run-up to Sunday's election. The problems with this election raise issues for next year's presidential elections.

<p>In the run-up to this election Egypt has attempted to silence opposition voices. In October, Egypt <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/egypt-cancels-permits-to-broadcast-live-television.php">issued new media restrictions</a> [JURIST report] that critics say effectively put all live television media, including talk shows and news shows, under government control. The telecommunications regulator cancelled the broadcast permits of all private media companies forcing them to apply for new licenses through the state television agency. The Muslim Brotherhood has also been targeted. In April, Attorney General Abdul Magid Mahmoud announced that five international MB members will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/egypt-court-to-try-muslim-brotherhood.php">tried in an Egyptian criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on charges of money laundering.  Egypt has also used the emergency laws extensively against other opposition parties. In May, the Egyptian Parliament <a href="http://ww.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/egypt-parliament-extends-state-of-emergency.php">voted to extend</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=egypt+emergency">state of emergency</a> [JURIST news archive] for two years. Despite the two-year extension, parliament voted to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/05/20105116134595496.html">limit the application of the emergency laws</a> [Al Jazeera report] only to cases of terrorism and drug trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The list of crimes range from serious offenses such as murder, rape and drug trafficking, to nonviolent crimes, including social security fraud and false claims for welfare benefits. A counter-proposal, which included stricter penalties for foreigners who commit crimes and the option for a judge to review each deportation case, failed to garner majority support. The initiative, promoted by the <a href="http://www.svp.ch/g3.cms">Swiss People's Party</a> (SVP) [party website, in French], has been met with strong criticism from the international community, which argues the initiative violates international law, specifically a <a href="http://www.europa.admin.ch/themen/00500/00506/00519/index.html?lang=en">1999 Bilateral Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons</a>. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a statement <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGNAU2010112819766&lang=e">urging the Swiss government not to enforce</a> [press release] the provisions of the initiative. AI Europe and Central Asia Deputy Programme Director John Dalhuisen said the initiative violates human rights:<blockquote>If put into practice, the amendment to the constitution risks violating Switzerland's obligations under international law, in particular the obligation not to return anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture or other forms of persecution. Switzerland cannot, and must not, allow popular -- and xenophobic -- initiatives to override its obligations under international law. Switzerland should also grant persons subject to deportation the opportunity to appeal any decision.</blockquote>The Swiss government will now begin the process of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/28/AR2010112803296.html">refining the initiative</a> [WP report] to comply with international treaties, and Parliament will vote to implement the initiative into law. 

<p>The controversial vote comes one year after Swiss voters passed another SVP initiative to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/switzerland-voters-approve-ban-on.php">ban the construction of minarets</a> [JURIST report], a type of tower associated with Islamic mosques. The ban was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-switzerland.php">opposed by the international community</a> [JURIST report] and angered Muslims around the world. In March, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/d_res_dec/A_HRC_13_L_1.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-council-condemns-switzerland.php">report</a>] condemning international religious discrimination and xenophobia. The resolution specifically criticized Switzerland's ban on the construction of minarets. In December 2009, a Swiss Muslim <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-minaret-ban-challenged-in.php">launched a legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the ban in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. It has been argued that the ban violates Articles 9, 13 and 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Udomsak Nitimontree dismissed the suit, brought in June by the <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/english/index.html">Electoral Commission of Thailand</a> (EC) [official website], citing the commissioner's failure to follow proper filing procedure by taking more than 15 days to file the complaint in court. Only six of the nine judges remained on the panel to deliver the verdict, with three judges recusing themselves for their involvement with the Democratic Party. If the suit had been successful, the Democratic Party would have been dissolved and party leaders, including current <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/en">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website], would have been banned from participating in politics for five years. 

<p>In August, the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-court-opens-trial-against-ruling-party.php">began hearing the case</a> [JURIST report], which centered around the misuse of an EC electoral grant where the EC alleged funds from the grant had been transferred to senior party officials in violation of the <a href="http://countrystudies.us/thailand/82.htm">Political Party Act</a> [LoC Backgrounder]. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-election-commission-calls-for.php">EC called for the dissolution of the party</a> [JURIST report] in April for failing to report donations from the business community and alleged misuse of the funds. The commission's decision came amid some of the deadliest political clashes Thailand has experienced in nearly two decades, as Thai protesters, known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=red+shirts">news archive</a>], called for new elections and Vejjajiva's resignation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court is considering whether a state court sentence-reduction motion consisting of a plea for leniency constitutes an "application for State post-conviction or other collateral review" under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002244----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2244(d)(2)</a> [text], resulting in an extension of the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [text, PDF] one-year limitations period for a state prisoner to file a federal <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the district court's judgment that a petition for leniency is different from an appeal to correct legal errors and therefore does not result in a tolling of the statute of limitations under AEDPA. The First Circuit's decision was in line with a Tenth Circuit ruling on the same issue, but the Third, Fourth and Eleventh Circuits had previously ruled that a petition for leniency does not toll the statute of limitations under AEDPA.

<p>Also Monday, the court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-996.pdf">Walker v. Martin</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-credit-card-notice-issue.php">report</a>] on whether a state law barring a prisoner from collaterally attacking his conviction is adequate to support a procedural bar to filing a <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. A California state law prevents prisoners from collaterally attacking their judgment when the prisoner "substantially delayed" filing his <em>habeas</em> petition. The court will decide whether the law is inadequate to bar the collateral attack because it is vague and because state courts failed to apply the state law consistently. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2009/11/20/08-15752.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that the state's law was not well-established or "consistently applied" and therefore did not constitute a procedural bar to collaterally attacking the conviction. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Aziz <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-29/tariq-aziz-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-over-fourth-set-of-iraq-charges.html">received a lesser sentence</a> [Bloomberg report] compared to other co-conspirators whom the Iraqi court found had greater involvement with the genocide of the Shiite Kurds and sentenced them to death by hanging. The 10-year sentence is the third judgment against Aziz, adding to his <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">March 2009 conviction</a> for murder and his <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-court-sentences-saddam-era-deputy-pm-aziz-to-death.php">recent death sentence</a>  [JURIST reports] for efforts to eliminate Shiite Muslim resistance efforts after the First Gulf War.

<p>Aziz could have received the death penalty in this case for his actions against the Kurds, but the court did not impose that sentence and Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Talabani">news archive</a>] has indicated that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/iraq-president-refuses-to-approve-execution-of-ex-foreign-minister.php">not sign a death warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Aziz's existing sentence.

The president's <a href="http://www.ytn.co.kr/_comm/pop_mov.php?s_mcd=0101&s_hcd=&key=201011291724100696">statement</a> [video, report in Korean] was the first addressed to the public since last week's attack on the residential area. He characterized North Korea's military action, which injured 16 and resulted in the deaths of two civilians in addition to two South Korean marines, as a crime against humanity because attacks against civilians are forbidden in times of war. Lee also vowed that North Korea will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AR19920101129?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FworldNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+International%29">face retaliation efforts</a> [Reuters report] if it continues provocation through the use of military means. In addition to addressing the public, Lee visited US troops stationed in South Korea to personally thank them for their showing of support, part of which has included continued participation with South Korean warships in military maneuvers. Japan has also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/world/asia/30seoul.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss">showed support</a> [NYT report] for South Korea, with prime minister Naoto Kan condemning North Korea's actions as "barbaric."

<p>North Korea's ongoing conflict with the South is not the only human rights issue for which the country has faced criticism. Earlier this month, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-committee-condemns-north-korea-rights-violations.php">UN committee condemned</a> [JURIST report] what it called persistent, "grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights" of its own people. In March, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] condemning North Korea for human rights violations. The <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.13 materials] decried "grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in particular the use of torture and labour camps against political prisoners and repatriated citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." Seeing little improvement, the council extended the assignment of Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [official profile], a Thai law professor who was appointed as a UN human rights expert in 2004, for one year and asked that North Korea and the UN General Assembly cooperate with and assist Muntarbhorn in his mission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder condemned WikiLeaks' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/statessecrets.html">recent release of government cables</a> [NYT backgrounder], saying that it <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/11/29/wikileaks/index.html?hpt=T1">threatens US national security</a> [CNN report], specifically by risking the safety of those serving the country and straining important diplomatic relationships. Holder said during a press conference, that "there is an active ongoing criminal investigation that [the DOJ] is conducting with the Department of Defense." He added, "there is a basis to believe crimes have been committed, and we are in the process of investigating those crimes." On Sunday, the Obama administration issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/28/statement-press-secretary">statement</a> [press release] through Press Secretary Robert Gibbs condemning the releases as "reckless and dangerous." Holder did not say when he expected to announce the investigation's results.

<p>Last month, UN Commissioner on Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-iraq-abuses.php">each</a> <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-iraq-governments-urged-to-investigate-reports-of-detainee-abuse.php">requested</a> [JURIST reports] that the US investigate alleged human rights abuses committed by US soldiers in Iraq detailed in documents posted on WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in July that documents posted to the website <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/wikileaks-founder-alleges-documents-may-reveal-us-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.php">may tie the US to war crimes in Afghanistan</a>. Also in July, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org">Pfc. Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; NYT <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/bradley_e_manning/index.html">backgrounder</a>] for leaking a controversial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzYTxuW2vmzk">classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq and classified State Department documents.

Manning was detained in Kuwait in May after releasing the video, entitled "Collateral Murder," on Wikileaks. Wikileaks does not ask sources to identify themselves, but Manning was reported to authorities by former hacker Andrian Lamo, who learned of the leaks after forming an online friendship with the soldier. Due to the gravity of the charges, Manning's investigation could lead to a court-martial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The cable says that then-deputy chief of the US mission to Germany, John Koenig, pressured Germany with the intention "not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German Government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S." German prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/germany-issues-arrest-warrants-in-cia.php">obtained arrest warrants</a> on January 31, 2007, for the 13 CIA officials involved but <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-rejects-germany-bid-for-extradition.php">decided not to seek extradition</a> [JURIST reports] later in the year, after the meeting with the US. The leaked document is seen as proof of the diplomatic pressure the US has put on even some of its strongest allies over its handling of terrorism suspects. Ben Wizner of the <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/us-pressured-germany-not-prosecute-cia-officers-torture-and-rendition">criticized</a> [statement] the US's action as a way to shield officials from accountability saying, "[t]he best way to restore our standing in the world, reassert the rule of law and strengthen our democracy is to support, not obstruct, meaningful accountability for torture."

<p>WikiLeaks is a website which purports to be a not-for-profit media organization that anonymously publishes leaked classified government documents. It has recently come under controversy due to a string of leaked documents including the cable in the El-Masri case. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official websites] said Monday they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/doj-announces-wikileaks-criminal-investigation.php">conducting criminal investigations</a> [JURIST report] into WikiLeaks over its release of confidential government communications. El-Masri claims that the CIA kidnapped him while he was traveling to Macedonia in 2003 and transported him to a secret detention facility in Afghanistan where he was held for four months. The case has been a controversial issue in both the US and in Europe. In October, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/europe-rights-court-to-review-macedonia-role-in-cia-extraordinary-rendition.php">review the involvement </a> [JURIST report] of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in El-Masri's arrest. In May, the Spanish National Court Office of the Prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-prosecutor-requests-arrest-warrants-for-cia-rendition-agents.php">petitioned judge Ismael Moreno</a> [JURIST report] to issue arrest warrants against the 13 CIA officials allegedly involved. The Prosecutor's Office argues that the court has jurisdiction to issue the warrants because the agents made a stop in Spanish territory using hidden identities without official Spanish government authorization to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Vicki Miles-LeGrange ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Muneer Awad, executive director of <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] in Oklahoma, who brought the suit claiming that State Question 755 (SQ 755) violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] because it stigmatizes his Muslim religion. Miles-Legrange found that Awad was substantially likely to succeed on the merits:<blockquote>Specifically, the Court finds that plaintiff has made a strong showing that State Question 755's amendment's primary effect inhibits religion and that the amendment fosters an excessive government entanglement with religion.  While defendants contend that the amendment is merely a choice of law provision that bans state courts from applying the law of other nations and cultures, regardless of what faith they may be based on, if any, the actual language of the amendment reasonably, and perhaps more reasonably, may be viewed as specifically singling out Sharia Law, conveying a message of disapproval of plaintiff's faith.</blockquote>Miles-LeGrange also stressed that the Bill of Rights was meant to protect the majority from taking away rights of individuals. SQ 755 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] in the November 2 mid-term elections with 70 percent of the vote.

<p>Miles-LeGrange's preliminary injunction comes less than a week after she <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-extends-order-blocking-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">extended</a> a temporary restraining order she <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-islamic-law-ban-challenged.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] just six days after the election, stopping the Oklahoma <a href="http://www.ok.gov/elections/">Board of Elections</a> [official website] from certifying the results. SQ 755 would prevent Oklahoma courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures," requiring them only to look to legal precedents of other states for guidance, provided that state does not use Islamic law. It was sponsored by state <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/committees/member.aspx?memberid=54">Representative Rex Duncan</a> (R) [official website], who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">described it as a preemptive strike</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma that would <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybvivrs_MH0">undermine</a> [MSNBC report, video] Judeo-Christian principles on which he says the US is founded. Critics <a href="/hotline/2010/11/oklahoma-ban-of-sharia-deems-Islam-as-un-american.php">contend</a> [JURIST comment] that it is based simply on an irrational fear of everything Muslim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ibrahim, originally charged with <a href=/jurist_search.php?q=pirates">piracy</a> [JURIST news archive], reached an agreement with prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/somalia-piracy-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-us-court.php">plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of attacking to plunder a vessel, committing an act of violence against persons on a vessel and the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence. Monday's sentencing marks the first in Norfolk for acts of piracy in more than 150 years. Ibrahim still faces additional sentencing after <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/somalia-piracy-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-dc-federal-court.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST report] in the District of Columbia to charges relating to a 2008 attack on the M/V CEC Future.

<p>Earlier this month, a federal jury in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against Ibrahim and five other defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">Kenya</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bram is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/29/afghanistan.sport.killings/">charged</a> [CNN report] with conspiracy to commit assault and battery, unlawfully striking another solider, violating a lawful order, dereliction of duty, cruelty, maltreatment and endeavoring to impede an investigation. He is not among the five men accused of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. If convicted of all the charges, he could face nine-and-a-half years in prison. Bram is accused of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AT15M20101130">severely beating an Army private</a> [Reuters report] in his unit to keep the solider from informing superiors about alleged drug abuse within the unit. 

<p>This the second court-martial resulting from an investigation into 12 infantry men accused of terrorizing civilians and fellow soldiers and illegal drug use in Afghanistan. In June, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">charged Specialist Jeremy Morlock</a> [JURIST report] with three counts of premeditated murder and one count of assault in the death of three Afghan civilians. The Army <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">announced in May</a> [JURIST report] that its Criminal Investigation Command was opening an investigation into the civilian deaths in Kandahar. The charges are the latest in a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In April, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial. Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">reduced from 15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi civilian. In December, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl.

The panel <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/33fd9c0607be66f188256d480060b74b/e5a3b5c9bfe0cfbb882576a9007fbd45/$FILE/order%20to%20reduce%20prison%20population.pdf">approved</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judges-approve-california-plan.php">report</a>] a revised <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/2009_Press_Releases/docs/11-12_Filed-Stamped_Filing.pdf">prison reduction plan</a> [text, PDF] in January, but action on the plan has been delayed, pending the government's Supreme Court appeal. Counsel for the state of California argued that the "extraordinary and unprecedented order ... requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates ... is extraordinarily premature." Counsel for the prisoners argued that the court must allow the lower court to provide a remedy for 20 years of overcrowding that has violated inmates' constitutional rights. The justices appeared split with the more conservative justices favoring California's position and the liberal justices favoring the prisoners'. Justice Anthony Kennedy may cast the deciding vote.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-804.pdf">CIGNA Corp. v. Amara</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on what "showing" is required to entitle participants of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/erisa.htm">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [materials] to recover benefits where there has been an alleged inconsistency between the explanation of benefits and the terms of the plan. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit applied a "likely harm" standard when affirming the district court's ruling. The circuit courts are deeply divided over this issue, with some requiring a showing of prejudice or reliance in order to recover benefits and others only requiring a discrepancy between the explanation of benefits and the terms of the plan. The Second Circuit has been the only circuit to apply the "likely harm" standard.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

Humphries</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that, when alleging a municipality violated their civil rights under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text], plaintiffs "must show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or custom," even if they are only seeking injunctive or declaratory relief. Tuesday's opinion, authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, drew heavily from <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/436/658/case.html">Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services</a> [opinion text], which held that, to prevail on a &#167; 1983 claim for monetary damages, plaintiffs must show a municipal policy or custom that caused their injuries. The court rejected the petitioners' arguments that <span class="casename">Monell</span> should me be limited to monetary damages, pointing out that language in the statute does not differentiate between types of relief requested. The court reasoned that its ruling in <span class="casename">Monell</span> left no room for holding municipalities strictly liable for the actions of their employees or for actions that are not part of that municipality's policy or custom. The court remanded the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for proceedings consistent with Tuesday's ruling. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision.

<p>The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-350.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-nasa-background-checks-evidence.php">report</a>] in October after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-to-consider-removal.php">agreeing to hear the case</a> [JURIST report] in February. The case arose after two parents were unable to have their names removed from California's <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/childabuse/">Child Abuse Central Index</a> [official materials], a database that collects reports of child abuse, after the charges against them were dismissed. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/01/30/0556467.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that the inability to remove "factually innocent" suspects from the database violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment and subsequently awarded $652,000 in attorney's fees for the appeal. The county challenged the Ninth Circuit's ruling on the grounds that the couple failed to show that the county had adopted a policy or practice that resulted in the constitutional violation, as required by <span class="casename">Monell</span> and that their failure to do so meant that they were not "prevailing parties" for the purposes of fee awards under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001988----000-.html">42 USC &#167; 1988</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investigation will be the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/201011301541530892.html">first formal investigation by a major regulatory agency</a> [Al Jazeera report] into the Internet search giant's business practices. The announcement follows complaints from three Europe-based search service providers that Google lowered the ranking of unpaid search results of their competing services and imposed exclusivity obligations on advertising partners with the goal of shutting out competition. The three companies that lodged complaints are UK-based price comparison site <a href="http://www.foundem.co.uk/">Foundem</a>, French legal search engine <a href="http://www.ejustice.fr/">ejustice.fr</a> and Italian shopping site <a href="http://www.ciao.it/">Ciao</a> [websites], owned by Microsoft through its own search engine Bing, which has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gISfW3QPAtgpTqdV2934DmcjKVkw?docId=ab7728e4f30a495f96e01786448094fd">struggled to wrestle online market share</a> [AP report] away from Google. In a <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2010/11/our-thoughts-on-european-commission.html">statement</a> [text], Google stressed:<blockquote>We've always focused on putting the user first by providing the best possible answers as quickly as possible - and our product innovation and engineering talent have delivered results that users seem to like, in a world where the competition is only one click away. ... We built Google for users, not websites. ... Not every website can come out on top, or even appear on the first page of our results, so there will almost always be website owners who are unhappy about their rankings.</blockquote>Google pledged to "work closely with the Commission to answer their questions"  

<p>Currently, Google faces separate antitrust inquiries in Italy, Germany and France, in addition to the EU probe. Recently, Google has also faced criticism on privacy and copyright protection in several countries. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] confirmed that it is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fcc-investigating-google-for-street-view-privacy-breach.php">investigating Google</a> [JURIST report] to determine if it violated communications laws when its Street View vehicles inadvertently collected private user data, including passwords and URLs, over WiFi networks. Additionally, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] announced that the company committed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">"significant breach"</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] through its Street View data collection. In October, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's internal policies and procedures that led to the breach. Also in October, Canadian Privacy Commissioner <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.cfm">Jennifer Stoddart</a> [official website] announced that the Street View breach <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF]. Investigations were also initiated in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">South Korea</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain </a>[JURIST reports].

The <a href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/default.asp">Association of Chief Police Officers</a> [association website], a private company consisting of police officers from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said that it has published the data with the hopes of encouraging other victims to come forward and report crimes. According to the report, police view an apparent increase in these figured from 2008 as a positive sign, indicating that more crimes are being reported and not necessarily that more crimes are being committed. In all, 52,028 crimes were reported in 2009 with the motivation for the offense being prejudice: <blockquote><ul>
	<li>Race: 43,426</li>
	<li>Religion/Faith: 2,083</li>
	<li>Sexual Orientation: 4,805</li>
	<li>Transgender: 312</li>
	<li>Disability: 1,402</li>
	<li>Total: 52,028</li>
</ul></blockquote>The report says that 703 of the faith-based crimes were of antisemitic nature.

<p>Last week, the FBI reported a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fbi-reports-hate-crimes-decrease-for-2009.php">decrease in US hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] for 2009. The number of reported incidents was down to 6,604 from 7,783 in 2008, while the number of reported victims was down to 8,336 from 9,691. In June, Canadian police reported a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-police-report-35-percent-increase-in-number-of-hate-crimes.php">35 percent increase in hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] from 2007 to 2008. Conversely, Russian racial hate crimes <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">decreased slightly in 2009</a> [JURIST report] because of increased police efforts, according to a report from the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egner admitted to US federal officials in 2007 that he had been a member of the squad, which is alleged to have rounded up women and children in specially modified vans to gas them with carbon monoxide. He is currently fighting efforts by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-continues-efforts.php">revoke his citizenship</a> [JURIST report], which would allow the government to extradite him to Serbia to stand trial on numerous counts of war crimes.

<p>Serbia's <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Office the War Crimes Prosecutor</a> [official website] announced in 2009 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-to-seek-us-extradition-of-nazi.php">ask the US for Egner's extradition</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2008, Serbian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-nazi-guards-living-in-us-may.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that they were gathering evidence for a case against Egner. Earlier that same week, the DOJ filed a <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/library/alleged_nazi_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] seeking to revoke Egner's US citizenship. Egner became a US citizen in 1966 but failed to disclose his Nazi service on his citizenship application. The DOJ argued that he was ineligible for citizenship both because of his service and because he concealed that information on his application.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The tribunal <a href = "http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/103/16244.pdf">found</a> [judgment, PDF] that the DRC violated Articles 6 and 12 of the <a href = "http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z1afchar.htm">African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> [text] as well as Articles 9 and 13 of the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] by the arrest, two month imprisonment, and expulsion of <A href = "http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=1&code=&case=103&k=7a">Ahmadou Sadio Diallo</a> [ICJ case materials]. The ICJ did not find the DRC in violation of any international law when it seized the two companies, Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire, that Diallo founded in the DRC and prevented him from continuing business with them, however the court did find that his detention and expulsion were contrary to law, stating:<blockquote>The DRC has failed to produce a single document or any other form of evidence to prove that Mr. Diallo was notified of the expulsion decree at the time of his arrest on 5 November 1995, or that he was in some way informed, at that time, of the reason for his arrest. Although the expulsion decree itself did not give specific reasons, as pointed out above, the notification of this decree at the time of Mr. Diallo's arrest would have informed him sufficiently of the reasons for that arrest for the purposes of Article 9, paragraph 2, since it would have indicated to Mr. Diallo that he had been arrested for the purpose of an expulsion procedure and would have allowed him, if necessary, to take the appropriate steps to challenge the lawfulness of the decree. However, no information of this kind was provided to him; the DRC, which should be in a position to prove the date on which Mr. Diallo was notified of the decree, has presented no evidence to that effect.</blockquote> Earlier in the proceedings, Guinea demanded a payment of <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6188730.stm">36 billion pounds</a> [BBC news]. The DRC has six months to come to a settlement with Guinea, or the ICJ will determine a settlement amount.

<p>Diallo was a Guinean citizen living in the DRC, then known as Zaire, where he established the import-export companies Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire, which dealt with the containerized transport of goods. After attempting to to collect on debts from business partners Zaire Shell, Zaire Mobil, Zaire Fina and Gecamines, Diallo was arrested and imprisoned, and then released after two months, in 1988. After seizing several properties of Diallo, the Zairean Prime Minister issued an expulsion decree against him in 1995, when he returned to Guinea. Guinea <a href = "http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/103/7175.pdf">brought suit</a> [application, in French, PDF] against the DRC in 1998, contending that Diallo was "unlawfully imprisoned by the authorities of that State" and "divested from his important investments, companies, bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, then expelled." The DRC <a href = "http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/103/13493.pdf">argued</a> [press release, PDF] that since it was no longer the nation of Zaire, it could not be held liable to what had occurred under that regime, and also claimed that Diallo had not exhausted all local remedies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_21083.pdf">"Dashed Hopes"</a> [text, PDF] says that, though there has been some increase the amount of food stuffs allowed to enter the Gaza Strip, there is still a lack of raw materials for factories and other necessary supplies being let into the territory. The report says this is destroying the Gaza Strip's weak economy and keeping most of its people dependent on foreign aid. According to the report, 39 percent of the residents are unemployed and 80 percent of the population is dependent on foreign aid because they cannot afford necessary goods. The groups allege that the blockade is in violation of international law and that Israel is violating its legal duty as an occupying nation to ensure the welfare of the residents. The Israel Coordinator of Activities in the Territories responded that the accusations by the rights groups were <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=197300">biased and distorted</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] and meant to mislead the public. Israel said it is committed to carrying out the easing of the blockade and wants to ensure that the raw materials it allows into the territory cannot be used for terrorist or militaristic activities.

<p>The Gaza Strip blockade brought international attention back on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after a May 31 raid by the Israeli military of a Turkish ship bound for the strip left nine dead. Under international pressure to lift the blockade, Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official profile] in June <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-agrees-to-ease-blockade-in-gaza-strip.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the Security Cabinet agreed to ease the nation's land blockade of the Gaza Strip. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/gaza-blockade-violates-international-law-icrc.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to the blockade, labeling it a violation of international humanitarian law under <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/com/380-600038?opendocument">Article 33 of the Geneva Conventions</a> [text; ICRC <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">backgrounder</a>]. Israel has so far <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-rejects-international-inquiry-into-flotilla-attack.php">refused an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the flotilla attack. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-council-condemns-israel-attack-and-calls-for-independent-investigation.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Israel's raid on the ships and initiated an independent investigation into possible violations of international law. The Turkish ship on which the violence occurred was one of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/31/q-a-gaza-freedom-flotilla">six organized</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder] by the <a href="http://www.freegaza.org/">Free Gaza Movement</a> [advocacy website] to carry protesters and humanitarian supplies to the isolated Palestinian enclave. </p>]]></content:encoded>
