		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Monday refused to reconsider a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ex-ubs-banker-sentenced-to-40-months-in.php">40-month prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] given to former <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] banker Bradley Birkenfeld in August. Birkenfeld admitted to helping a California real-estate developer hide $200 million to avoid paying taxes and has cooperated with the government in its investigation of employees of Swiss banks that the government says take advantage of Switzerland&#39;s strict confidentiality laws to help Americans hide money and avoid paying taxes. Birkenfeld filed a motion for leniency based on his cooperation, but Judge William Zloch of the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] rejected that request. Birkenfeld is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on Friday.<br /><br />In November, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and the US <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-lauds-success-of-irs-amnesty-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that more than 14,700 Americans have reported to the IRS previously hidden overseas bank accounts in response to a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=206012,00.html">temporary forgiveness program</a> [official website], allowing delinquent taxpayers to avoid criminal prosecution for tax evasion by paying all overdue taxes and penalties. In September, the US and Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-switzerland-sign-treaty-on-sharing.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the amount of information shared between the two nations on would-be tax evaders. The agreement, constructed in accordance with Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/57/42219418.pdf">Model Tax Convention</a> [text, PDF], came one month after a Swiss banker and lawyer were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/swiss-banker-lawyer-charged-with.php">indicted in US federal court</a> [JURIST report] for helping clients hide assets. Earlier in August, the US reached a preliminary agreement with Switzerland over the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-reaches-deal-with-switzerland-over.php">identification of anonymous accounts</a> [JURIST report] in Swiss banks, which would aid US officials in identifying those who seek to evade taxes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian <a href="http://www.moha.gov.my/">Home Ministry</a> [official website, in Malay] on Monday appealed last week&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/malaysia-high-court-allows-non-muslims.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the High Court that non-Muslims can use the word &quot;Allah&quot; as a translation for the word &quot;God.&quot; The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/malaysia-court-accepts-catholic.php">case</a> [JURIST report] was brought by the <em>Herald</em>, a weekly Catholic publication, challenging the Malaysian government&#39;s three-year ban on the practice. The newspaper argued that other options such as &quot;Tuhan&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; were <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126239298638513113.html">not appropriate</a> [WSJ report] in the Malay-language editions of their publications, while Muslim groups have argued that use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; by the Catholic church was an attempt to confuse Muslims. The ruling triggered widespread protests throughout the country. The government is also <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=465945">seeking a stay of enforcement</a> [<em>Bernama</em> report] of last week&#39;s ruling pending appeal.<br /><br /><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Malaysia">Malaysia</a> [JURIST news archive], a Muslim-majority country, has struggled in recent years to find a balance between modernization and the policies of a more traditional Islamic government that has encouraged the spread of Sharia courts. Approximately 60 percent of Malaysians are Muslim, while Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus comprise about 35 percent of the population, falling under the jurisdiction of civil courts. Both civil and Sharia courts have the authority to address cases involving religious issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-26337.htm">rule</a> [text] ending a policy prohibiting people with HIV or AIDS from entering the country went into effect on Monday. The decision by the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) [official website] to remove HIV from its list of communicable diseases of public significance <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8438865.stm">ended</a> [BBC report] the 22-year-old ban. When the rule was published in November, Health and Human Services <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/">Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/11/20091102b.html">said</a> [press release], &quot;[t]he ability to travel freely and have access to affordable health care should be available to everyone. This change has been a long time coming, and I am pleased it is happening now.&quot; Clemens Ruland, a Netherlands native, is expected to be the <a href="http://www.fyne.co.uk/index.php?item=826">first HIV-positive visitor</a> [Fyne Times report] since the ban was lifted when he lands in New York Monday.<br /><br />The US had been one of only about a dozen countries that ban travelers with HIV or AIDS. In October, a report indicated China was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-considering-lifting-ban-on.php">considering lifting its ban</a> [JURIST report] against travelers with HIV or AIDS. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/dhs-easing-restrictions-on-hiv-positive.php">relaxed restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on issuing visas to HIV-positive applicants. Also in 2008, the US <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h5501enr.txt.pdf">removed a statutory restriction</a> [text] on issuing visas to HIV-positive foreigners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Peruvian Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema%5CSalasSupremas%5CSPT%5Cdocumentos%5CR.N.%20N%C2%BA%2019-01-2009-A.V..pdf">upheld</a> [decision, in Spanish] a 25-year sentence given to former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3112321.stm">Alberto Fujimori</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fujimori">news archive</a>] after his conviction on charges of ordering assassinations and kidnappings during his 1990-2000 presidency. The First Transitory Criminal Chamber last week <a href="http://elcomercio.pe/noticia/390160/condena-25-anos-fujimori-fue-ratificada">unanimously ratified</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Comercio</span> report, in Spanish] the sentence <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/peru-ex-president-fujimori-convicted-of.php">handed down</a> [JURIST report] in April for approving the November 1991 killing of 15 people in Lima&#39;s <a href="http://www.123exp-geography.com/t/18624464250/">Barrios Altos neighborhood</a> [backgrounder] and the July 1992 <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hemisphere/pubs/abducted.shtml">kidnapping and murder of 10 people</a> [MIT backgrounder] from Lima&#39;s La Cantuta University. The court voted <a href="http://www.larepublica.pe/politica/03/01/2010/tribunal-confirmo-la-condena-por-unanimidad">4-1</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Republica</span> report, in Spanish] to uphold Fujimori&#39;s sentence for the aggravated kidnapping of journalist <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/inv estigations/icij/journalists/profile/796/">Gustavo Gorriti</a> [ICIJ profile] and businessman Samuel Dyer Ampudia. The kidnapping, murder and &quot;disappearance&quot; of civilians was part of the so-called &quot;Dirty War&quot; carried out by Fujimora&#39;s government against the Maoist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3985659.stm">Shining Path</a> [BBC backgrounder] rebel group during the 1990s.<br /><br />In October, Fujimori was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison on multiple counts of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/peru-ex-president-fujimori-sentenced-to.php">illegal wiretapping and bribery</a> [JURIST report], a sentence which he <a href="http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=93471">plans to appeal</a> [IPS report, in Spanish].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Sunday upheld a ban against wearing the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_1.shtml">niqab</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=niqab">news archive</a>], or full-face veil, while taking university examinations. The Cairo Administrative Court <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100104/FOREIGN/701039884/1135">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [<em>National</em> report] filed by 55 niqab-wearing university students challenging the ban, which was put in place by the government in October. The government said that the ban was enacted partially because students were cheating on exams by using the niqab to disguise themselves as other candidates. The students claim that the ban infringes on their religious rights. The students&#39; lawyer says that he <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/01/201013155747114415.html">plans to appeal</a> [Al Jazeera report] to a higher court.<br /><br />Although many Egyptian women wear a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hijab">hijab</a> [JURIST news archive], or headscarf that leaves the face visible, use of the niqab has recently become more prevalent, creating controversy. The government also banned the niqab in public university dormitories in October, but that was overturned last month. In 2007, Egypt&#39;s Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/egypt-court-rejects-private-university.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Pages/default.aspx">American University of Cairo</a> (AUC) [official website] ban against wearing the niqab on campus, finding that the private university could not require a student to unveil her face because it was her constitutional right under Egyptian law to practice her religion. The court nonetheless said it would allow a mandatory identity check of veiled women by guards. While most Muslim scholars argue that wearing a headscarf is mandatory, not all agree that Islam requires women to wear a niqab.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://portal.kehakiman.gov.my/">Malaysian High Court</a> [Malaysian courts website] ruled Thursday that non-Muslims can use the word &quot;Allah&quot; as a translation for the word &quot;God&quot;, overturning a three-year government ban on the practice. The case was brought by the <em>Herald</em>, a weekly Catholic publication, against the Malaysian government in response to the ban. The newspaper argued that other options such as &quot;Tuhan&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126239298638513113.html">were not appropriate</a> [WSJ report] in the Malay-language editions of their publications, while Muslim groups have argued that use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; by the Catholic church was an attempt to confuse Muslims. The ruling has been opposed by Muslim groups, and the Malay-rights group <a href="http://www.pribumiperkasa.com/perkasa/">Pribumi Perkasa</a> [advocacy website, in Malay] has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ijmL8VIBCKACOZw5GEOz3XjXS8rg">called for demonstrations</a> [AFP report].

Approximately 58 percent of Malaysia&#39;s population of 26 million are ethnic Malays, generally Muslims under Sharia jurisdiction. The remaining 40 percent of the population are mainly ethnic Chinese, indigenous, or Indian, and are generally Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, or Taoist/Confucian falling under the jurisdiction of civil courts. Both civil and Sharia courts have the authority to address <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/malaysia-islamic-court-allows.php">cases</a> [JURIST report] involving religious issues.

Jankovic is accused of killing at least 19 civilians in eastern Bosnia during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">1992-95 Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. A spokesperson for Serbia&#39;s <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index.htm">Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor</a> [official website, in Serbian] indicated that Jankovic is potentially associated with the killing of Muslim civilians near the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik in 1992. The Serbian war crimes prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/serbia-war-crimes-prosecutor-indicts-2.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] two other alleged war criminals in August 2008 in connection with the killing of 700 Muslim civilians near Zvornik. <br /><br />Jankovic&#39;s arrest comes one month after a report detailing Serbia&#39;s cooperation with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/serbia-icty-cooperation-progressing.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] to the UN Security Council.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2bf5cd42-8bf0-4d3d-95a6-da4151e30396/1/doc/08-4726-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2bf5cd42-8bf0-4d3d-95a6-da4151e30396/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] are not required to confirm or deny the existence of electronic surveillance records under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. The suit was brought by advocates of former Guantanamo Bay detainees after the agencies invoked FOIA exceptions to information requests regarding warrantless electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP). The appellate court affirmed the district court&#39;s holding, finding that federal agencies are allowed to file <a href="http://www.doi.gov/foia/glomar.htm">Glomar responses</a> [DOI backgrounder] declining to address the existence of information, and that such responses are allowable in regards to information obtained through publicly known intelligence programs. Plaintiffs had argued that the Glomar doctrine is limited to information obtained by secret programs. The court wrote:<blockquote>The fact that the public is aware of the program&#8217;s existence does not mean that the public is entitled to have information regarding the operation of the program, its targets, the information it has yielded, or other highly sensitive national security information that the government has continued to classify. Indeed, the fact that the TSP&#8217;s existence has been made public reinforces the government&#8217;s continuing stance that it is necessary to keep confidential the details of the program&#8217;s operations and scope.<br /><br />We therefore hold that, as a threshold matter, and as a general rule, an agency may invoke the Glomar doctrine in response to a FOIA request regarding a publicly revealed matter. An agency only loses its ability to provide a Glomar response when the existence or nonexistence of the particular records covered by the Glomar response has been officially and publicly disclosed.</blockquote>The court found that the affidavits provided by the agencies met their burden of proof for the FOIA exception. Additionally, the court found no evidence that the NSA used the exception to conceal illegal or improper activities.<br /><br />The NSA&#39;s warrantless surveillance program has been harshly criticized since being disclosed by then-president George W.

		<title>Montana supreme court rules physician assisted suicide not banned by state law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A sharply divided <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/docContent.dll?Library=CISDOCSVR01^doaisd510&ID=003824347">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that physician assisted suicide is not banned by state law, making Montana the third state to allow the practice after Oregon and Washington. The Court upheld in part and reversed in part a lower court ruling, agreeing with its finding that physician assisted suicide is not illegal under state law, but giving no opinion on the greater constitutional question addressed by the lower court. Instead, it found in a 4-3 decision that physician assisted suicide was not rendered illegal under state statute or by public policy concerns, stating: <blockquote> There is no indication in [state law] that physician aid in dying is against public policy. Indeed, [it] reflects legislative respect for the wishes of a patient facing incurable illness. [It] also indicates legislative regard and protection for a physician who honors his legal obligation to the patient. [State statute] immunizes a physician for following the patient&#8217;s declaration even if it requires the physician to directly unplug the patient&#8217;s ventilator or withhold medicine or medical treatment that is keeping the patient alive. ... In light of the long-standing, evolving and unequivocal recognition of the terminally ill patient&#8217;s right to self-determination at the end of life ... it would be incongruous to conclude that a physician&#8217;s indirect aid in dying is contrary to public policy. ... [T]he inquiry stops there.</blockquote> An official of the Montana <a href="http://www.doj.mt.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01suicide.html?ref=us">said</a> [NYT report] that the ruling represented the Court&#39;s recognition that the issue should be resolved in the state legislature. The <a href="http://www.montanafamily.org/">Montana Family Foundation</a> [advocacy website] an opponent of physician assisted suicide, has <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/dec/31/montana-high-court-state-allows-assisted-suicide/">promised</a> [<em>Spokesman-Review</em> report] to take the issue to the state legislature.<br /><br />Montana&#39;s First Judicial District <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/montana-court-rules-assisted-suicide.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 that terminally ill patients have the right to commit physician assisted suicide. The case, <a href="http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/custom/sll/SLL_FN_Home.htm">Baxter v. Montana</a> [case materials], was brought by a number of terminally-ill Montanans, their doctors, and <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/">Compassion &amp; Choices</a> [advocacy website], an organization supporting the legalization of physician assisted suicide. The plaintiffs alleged that their right to assisted suicide was guaranteed by the <a href="http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/mca_toc/Constition.htm">Montana Constitution</a> [text], under provisions relating to their rights of privacy, individual dignity, due process, equal protection, and the right to seek safety, health and happiness in all lawful ways. The lower court held that terminally ill individuals have the right to die with dignity, and have the right to obtain self-administered medications to hasten death if they find their suffering to be unbearable. In November 2008, voters in Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/washington-supports-lethal.php">approved a ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] that allows terminally ill, legally competent adults to obtain lethal prescriptions without exposing themselves, their physicians, or others to criminal penalties. The Washington measure was modeled on neighboring Oregon&#39;s <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/index.shtml">Death with Dignity Act</a> [official materials], enacted in 1997 and <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court in 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Threats against judges, US attorneys, and assistant US attorneys have more than doubled over the last six years, according to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/plus/e1002r.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The report, conducted by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website], found that judges, US attorneys, and assistant US attorneys received 1,278 threats in 2008, compared to 592 in 2003. Additionally, the report found that threats are not always consistently and promptly reported. According to the report: <br /><blockquote><br />Moreover, when threats are reported, the USMS [US Marshals Service] does not consistently provide an appropriate response for the risk level posed by the threat. In addition, the USMS does not fully or effectively coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to respond to threats against federal judicial officials.<br /></blockquote><br />The report also found that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/">Executive Office for United States Attorneys</a> (EOUSA) [official website] and United States Attorneys Offices (UASO) could not adequately deal with threats.  Among the report&#39;s 14 recommendations were reinforcing in attorneys and judges the importance of reporting threats, establishing controls within the USMS to rate threat levels, and creating procedures to ensure better communication between the USMS and the FBI and local law enforcement.<br /><br />US judges and court administrators have been increasingly focused on <a href="http://www.ncsconline.org/wc/CourTopics/ResourceGuide.asp?topic=CtSecu">security issues</a> [NCSC materials] following a spate of <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/man-who-committed-suicide-in-wisconsin.php">attacks</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/suspected-pipe-bomb-explodes-outside.php">bombings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/ny-man-arrested-for-threatening.php">threats</a> [JURIST reports] directed at judges, their families, and their workplaces in recent years. In 2008, Brian Nichols was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-sentences-atlanta-gunman.php">sentenced to seven life terms</a> to be served consecutively in addition to other punishment for <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-judge-shot-in-atlanta.php">shooting and killing a federal judge</a> [JURIST reports] and other personnel in an Atlanta courthouse in an attempted escape. In April 2008, Ohio resident David Tuason was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/ohio-man-indicted-for-threatening-to.php">indicted for allegedly threatening to blow up the US Supreme Court building</a> [JURIST report] and attack black men, including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Other <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/ginsburg-oconnor-received-death.php">death threats</a> [JURIST report] have been reported against Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and now-retired Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor.<br /><br />3:00 PM ET - A gunman opened fire in a Las Vegas courthouse Monday morning, killing a security officer and wounding a deputy US marshal. The gunman, Johnny Lee Wicks, was shot dead by court security officers. Wicks was reportedly upset over losing a lawsuit related to his Social Security benefits.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A special court in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar</a> [JURIST news archive] Friday charged US citizen Kyaw Zaw Lwin, also known as <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/NYINYI.php">Nyi Nyi Aung</a> [Freedom Now backgrounder], with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/01/AR2010010100542.html">forgery and violating the country&#39;s foreign currency act</a> [AP report].  The charges could result in a maximum of ten years in prison if Aung is convicted.  Aung was arrested on September 3 when he entered the country, and was initially accused of inciting anti-government unrest.  He protested his arrest and treatment while in detention with a 12-day hunger strike in mid-December.  <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/home.php">Freedom Now</a> [advocacy website], which represents Aung, <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressRelease-NyiNyiAungURGENT.pdf">claimed</a> [press release] that the government had committed a variety of human rights violations:<blockquote>During his first two weeks of his detention, Burmese authorities tortured Mr. Aung. He was deprived of food and sleep, beaten, and denied medical treatment. Mr. Aung was also illegally deprived of his right to U.S. consular access. He is also being denied his rights under Burmese law to a public trial and regular access to counsel.<br /></blockquote>Fifty-three members of the US House of Representatives have <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressReleaseandHouseLetter-NyiNyiAung.10-18-09.pdf">called</a> [press release and letter, PDF] on Myanmar to release Aung, but the US government has not officially requested a release, despite additional <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/12/18/burma-clinton-should-press-release-burmese-american">calls</a> [press release] from international groups like <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website].<br /><br />Also Friday, Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court set January 18 as the date for the full court to hear final arguments by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] in her latest appeal.  Freedom Now represents both Aung and Suu Kyi. Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court agreed in December to hear Suu Kyi&#39;s appeal of the latest 18-month extension of her house arrest. The decision for the full court to hear her appeal came as the result of a preliminary hearing held after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/myanmar-high-court-to-consider-suu-kyi.php">initially agreed to consider the appeal</a> [JURIST report]. Suu Kyi&#39;s lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/suu-kyi-appeals-house-arrest-to-myanmar.php">filed the appeal</a> in October after a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/myanmar-court-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] an earlier appeal. They argue that her conviction should not stand because it is based on the now-defunct 1974 constitution.

Moussaoui&#39;s lawyers had requested that his guilty plea and be withdrawn and a new trial be granted, arguing that his plea was involuntary due to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentv">Fifth and Sixth Amendment</a> [text] violations. His lawyers also argued that his unawareness of the charges against him violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule11.htm">Rule 11</a> [text] of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and that his trial counsel did not have access to statements made by al Qaeda members denying Moussaoui&#39;s involvement in the 9/11 conspiracy. The appeals court rejected all of those arguments and &quot;affirm[ed] Moussaoui&#39;s convictions and sentences in their entirety.&quot;<br /><br />The appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/fourth-circuit-to-rehear-oral-arguments.php">ordered new arguments</a> in the case in July due to the retirement of Chief Judge Karen Williams, who heard <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fourth-circuit-hears-arguments-in.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] last January.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Incumbent Afghan Minister of Justice <a href="http://www.moj.gov.af/?lang=en&p=e2">Sarwar Danish</a> [official profile] was among 17 cabinet nominees who were <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Afghan_Parliament_Starts_Voting_On_New_Cabinet/1919354.html">rejected</a> [RFE report] on Saturday by the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/PVE/Default.aspx">Wolesi Jirga</a> [official website], Afghanistan&#39;s lower house of parliament. Danish, who has served as Minister of Justice since 2004, is one of <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Proposed_Afghan_Cabinet_Stocked_With_Familiar_Faces/1910034.html">11 current cabinet members</a> [RFE report] nominated by Afghan President <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/sroot_eng.aspx?id=166">Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>] to fill posts in his new cabinet.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in Afghanistan <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=1813">Kai Eide</a> [official profile] said Sunday that the lack of a full cabinet was a &quot;political setback, in the sense that it prolongs the situation without a functioning government,&quot; but <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=1783&ctl=Details&mid=1882&ItemID=7100">expressed hope</a> [press release] that parliament&#39;s use of its constitutional authority would result in a more transparent and accountable government. <br /><br />In November, Afghan authorities announced that they had <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/afghan-cabinet-ministers-investigated.php">questioned two cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] and were investigating 15 other government officials on corruption charges, but would not release their identities pursuant to Afghan law. The announcement came a week after Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/afghanistan-president-vows-to-fight.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] in his inaugural address to fight governmental corruption, and in the face of growing international pressure. Karzai <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8363148.stm">announced</a> [BBC report] the formation of a commission to investigate corruption in November, after Afghanistan was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-afghanistan-ranked-most-corrupt.php">ranked</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] as the second most corrupt country in the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Richardo M. Urbina of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/memorandum-of-dismissal-of-charges-against-blackwater-guards/original.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges against the five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] guards indicted for their involvement in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in September 2007. Urbina cited statements of the defendants which he said were given under the threat of job loss and with the promise of immunity. Because of the unconstitutionality of the statements, Urbina determined, prosecutors had to put together a case without them, something they had failed to do, explaining: <blockquote>The compelled statements of [the] defendants played a determinative role in the government&#8217;s decision to focus the prosecution on them. ... [It] guided the questioning of witnesses during the investigation, resulted in the discovery of physical evidence and provided the government with a version of events that each defendant was locked into and helped steer the investigation. In sum, far from being unimportant and insubstantial, the defendants&#8217; compelled statements pervaded nearly every aspect of the government&#8217;s investigation and prosecution, and the government&#8217;s use of those statements appears to have played a critical role in the indictment against each of the defendants. Accordingly, the court declines to excuse the government&#8217;s reckless violation of the defendants&#8217; constitutional rights as harmless error.</blockquote> Prosecutors <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122124185">expressed disappointment</a> [NPR report] with the decision, but have yet to announce whether they will appeal. A spokesman for the Iraqi government has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/01/201011101136634433.html">stated</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] that it will push for an appeal, fearing the decision as it stands will cause a strain in relations between the two countries. The Iraqi government also stated that an independent investigation carried out by the Iraqi investigators had conclusively confirmed the guilt of the defendants.<br /><br />Prosecutors from the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-dropping-charges-against-blackwater.php">dropped manslaughter charges</a> [JURIST report] against one of the defendants in November. Five defendants <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/indicted-blackwater-guards-plead-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to manslaughter and weapons charges last January. The five guards were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-indicts-five-blackwater-guards.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on charges of voluntary manslaughter, attempt to commit manslaughter, and using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, which carries a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence. A sixth guard pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. A <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> [official website] inquiry into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report]. Iraq security contractors <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">lost their immunity</a> from prosecution under the new US Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq that was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] in December 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/john_g_roberts_jr">Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</a> [OYEZ profile] issued an unusually brief <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/newsroom/2009/2009YearEndReport.pdf">year-end report</a> [PDF] on the federal judiciary Thursday in his capacity as head of the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/judconf.html">Judicial Conference of the United States</a> [official website], declining to address judiciary needs as done in previous years. On a single page, the 2009 report said the federal courts were &quot;operating soundly&quot; and thanked judges and court employees for their service. The report skirted budgetary requests, reasoning that only essential information should be passed on when the federal government was facing &quot;many difficult issues&quot; and when many citizens were experiencing hardship. In a four-page statistical appendix, however, Roberts noted several significant trends:<BLOCKQUOTE><ul><li>The total number of cases filed in the Supreme Court decreased from 8,241 filings in the 2007 Term to 7,738 filings in the 2008 Term&#8212;a decrease of 6.1%.<br /><li>The number of cases filed in the Court&#8217;s <em>in forma pauperis</em> docket decreased from 6,627 filings in the 2007 Term to 6,142 filings in the 2008 Term&#8212;a 7.3% decrease.<br /><li>In 2009, filings in the regional courts of appeals declined 6% to 57,740. Filings of criminal appeals, bankruptcy appeals, and original proceedings rose, but reductions occurred in filings of civil appeals and appeals of administrative agency decisions.<br /><li>Civil filings in the U.S. district courts rose 3%, increasing by 9,140 cases to 276,397.<br /><li>Criminal case filings (including transfers) rose 8% to 76,655, and the number of defendants climbed 6% to 97,982, surpassing the previous record for the number of defendants, 92,714, set in 2003. The number of criminal cases reached its highest level since 1932, the year before ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed prohibition.<br /><li>Immigration filings climbed to record levels, as cases jumped 21% to 25,804, and the number of defendants rose 19% to 26,961.</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>Last year, Roberts&#39; report called for cost-of-living raises for federal judges. In his <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/roberts-again-urges-salary-increase-for.php">2007 report</a> [JURIST report], Roberts called for judicial pay raises in accordance with pending legislation. In <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/roberts-calls-lack-of-pay-hike-for.php">2006</a> [JURIST report], Roberts declared that raises were necessary to keep up with private-sector salaries and to maintain the quality and independence of federal judges. Roberts&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/roberts-calls-for-judicial-pay-raise.php">first annual report</a> [JURIST report] as Chief Justice in 2005 contained similar requests.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Serbian government on Monday filed a lawsuit against Croatia in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], accusing the Croatian government of committing genocide during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+war">1991-1995 Balkan War</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/vest.php?id=62448">suit</a> [press release] is in response to a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=cry&case=118&k=73">similar suit</a> [case materials] filed by Croatia against Serbia in 1999. The ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/icj-takes-croatia-genocide-case-against.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last year that it has jurisdiction to hear that case. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said that Serbia had hoped to avoid filing suit but was left with no choice when Croatia refused to withdraw its case. In its suit, Serbia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/04/world/AP-EU-Serbia-Croatia-World-Court.html">claims</a> [AP report] that Croatia committed genocide by expelling its Serb population in 1995.<br /><br />In 2007, the ICJ ruled in a similar lawsuit brought by Bosnia against Serbia. The court found that although the Serbian government was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/icj-serbia-not-guilty-of-bosnia.php">not directly responsible for genocide</a> [JURIST report] during the war, the country failed to meet its obligations to prevent genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. That case marked the first time that a UN member state had been tried for genocide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Tuesday ordered that $21.2 million in gold coins and bullion seized last year from the offices of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7898924.stm">Allen Stanford</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=allen+stanford">news archive</a>] be returned to investors. Stanford is accused of <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/stanford/StanfordIndict.pdf">defrauding investors</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-indicted-in-7.php">report</a>] out of $7 billion. Judge David Godbey of the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] ruled that the gold must be returned to the more than 200 investors whose assets were stored in the Stanford vaults. Also Tuesday, Stanford&#39;s lawyers asked the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] to review a lower court order denying him bail.<br /><br />Last week, it was reported that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/doj-investigating-financier-stanford.php">begun investigating</a> [JURIST report] political donations and other connections between Stanford and US lawmakers. Stanford donated more than $2.3 million to lawmakers&#39; campaigns and spent more than $5 million in lobbying efforts while allegedly carrying out the fraud. Stanford has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him and was originally set to be released on $500,000 bail until prosecutors successfully appealed the decision. Through three of his investment companies, Stanford allegedly violated the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/33Act.htm">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/34Act.htm">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/uscode15-80a-1.htm">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [texts]. He was originally <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20901.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">JURIST report</a>] in February with running a fraudulent investment scheme by selling certificates of deposit on the promise of improbably high interest rates.

Israeli <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Personalities/From+A-Z/Daniel_Ayalon.htm">Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Danny Ayalon</a> [official profile] met Tuesday in Jerusalem with UK <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/TheLawOfficers/Pages/AttorneyGeneralBiog.aspx">Attorney General Patricia Janet Scotland</a> [official profile] to <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/MFA+Spokesman/2010/Deputy-FM-Ayalon-meets-with-British-Attorney-General-5-Jan-2010.htm">challenge</a> [press release] several British arrest warrants for Israeli politicians and military officials, stating that the warrants are straining Israeli-British foreign relations. The arrest warrants are the result of Palestinian plaintiffs working with British lawyers to file charges against Israeli officials. Scotland, who also <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/cgi-bin/dovrut/dovrut_search_eng.pl?mesge126268782732688760">gave a speech</a> [press release] on Tuesday at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Ayalon that UK officials were working to resolve the issue and protect senior officials traveling to the UK.<br /><br />Israeli officials are concerned about the possibility of being charged with war crimes in Britain and other foreign countries based on the theory of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder], which allows a country to prosecute serious crimes against humanity no matter where the activity takes place. Last month, Former Israeli foreign minister <a href="http://tzipilivni.co.il/">Tzipi Livni</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a UK trip</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on war crimes charges relating to Israel&#39;s Gaza offensive. In October, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/11/Lieutenant-General%20Moshe%20Ya-alon">Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-cabinet-minister-cancels-uk-trip.php">called off</a> [JURIST report] a scheduled trip to the UK after legal advisers from the Israeli <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] said that he may be arrested over his involvement in a 2002 airstrike that killed a Hamas leader and 14 civilians.

The <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText09/HouseText09/H5294.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] passed by a vote of 67-3 in the <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/house/">House</a> and 31-3 in the <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/Senate/">Senate</a> [official websites], receiving support from both Democrats and Republicans. Neither domestic partnerships or civil unions are recognized in Rhode Island, and the bill will require that a same-sex partner produce documentation establishing the nature of the relationship, such as proof of a joint bank account, mortgage, or car registration, and that the relationship had lasted for a year or longer. The legislation will also apply to unmarried heterosexual couples. Carcieri, a Republican, had argued that the &quot;bill represents a disturbing trend over the past few years of the incremental erosion of the principles surrounding traditional marriage.&quot;<br /><br />The veto of the burial rights bill comes amid a larger battle in Rhode Island over same-sex marriage, which, according to a <a href="http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2009/05/survey">Brown University poll</a> [press release], has the approval of 60 percent of registered voters in the state. Rhode Island and Maine remain the only two states in New England that do not recognize same-sex marriage after legislation to legalize same-sex marriage was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">vetoed by voters in Maine</a> [JURIST report] in November. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, and is set to become legal in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports], pending Congressional inaction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/institutions-and-politics_6814/new-french-government_5631/michele-alliot-marie-biography_9235.html#so_4">Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie</a> [official profile] and French <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/ministry_158/ministers_1903/bernard-kouchner_5617/index.html">Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner</a> [official profile] on Wednesday announced plans to create a special judicial service to investigate and charge individuals accused of crimes against humanity and genocide in France or in other countries. The <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2010/01/06/pour-la-creation-d-un-pole-genocides-et-crimes-contre-l-humanite-au-tgi-de-paris-par-michele-alliot-marie-et-bernard-kouchner_1287995_3232.html">new judicial unit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> report, in French] would streamline the prosecution of Rwandans living in France who are accused of war crimes committed during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1288230.stm">1994 Rwandan conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwanda">news archive</a>]. Alliot-Marie and Kouchner said in their joint <a href="https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.gb.asp?liste=20100106.gb.html">statement</a> [press release]: <br /><blockquote><br />Today, the judicial treatment of genocide and crimes against humanity encounters a number of specific difficulties. The offenses in question take place beyond our borders. The lack of coordination of the data, evidence and witness statements complicates the task of investigators and judges. The technical nature of the matters involved necessitates special high-level skills. The complexity of the litigation inevitably slows down the proceedings. The increase in the number of unresolved cases, particularly those of more than 15 Rwandans awaiting trial, is spurring us to act fast.<br /></blockquote><br />The proposal is part of a bill that will be considered in Parliament during the first half of this year. <br /><br />Under French law, there must be a connection between France and the alleged crime in order to prosecute individuals in the French justice system. This stands in contrast to the theory of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder] used in several other countries, including the UK. Earlier this week, foreign relations between Israel and the UK further <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-officers-abandon-uk-visit.php">deteriorated</a> [JURIST report] as a result of several British arrest warrants charging senior Israeli politicians and military officers of war crimes. In October, Spain, which has exercised universal jurisdiction to indict such individuals as Osama bin Laden and Augusto Pinochet, passed a law <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limiting the reach</a> [JURIST report] of its universal jurisdiction statute to those offenses committed by or against Spaniards, or where the perpetrators are in Spain. This limitation led to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-groups-urge-spain-to-continue.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] from human rights groups that support the broad use of universal jurisdiction against accused war criminals.

The case was <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-1065.htm">Pottawattamie County v. McGhee</a> [docket], in which the Court had been asked to consider whether a prosecutor may be subjected to a civil trial and potential damages for a wrongful conviction and incarceration where the prosecutor allegedly (1) violated a criminal defendant&#39;s &quot;substantive due process&quot; rights by procuring false testimony during the criminal investigation, and then (2) introduced that same testimony against the criminal defendant at trial. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/11/071453P.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the prosecutor was not protected from suit by absolute immunity. The two sides moved for dismissal Monday under <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/ctrules/2007rulesofthecourt.pdf">Supreme Court Rule 46</a> [text, PDF] without specifying reasons.<br /><br />The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in_04.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case on November 4.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the trial over the constitutionality of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a>, which banned <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archives] in California, will be videotaped and broadcast on YouTube. Judge Vaughn Walker of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/07/BA121BEGI8.DTL">ruled</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] that while the trial will not be broadcast live, it will be recorded and posted on the court&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/usdccand">YouTube channel</a> [website]. Walker&#39;s ruling came over the objection of Proposition 8 supporters, who <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gay-marriage7-2010jan07,0,6401906.story">argued</a> [LAT report] that broadcasting the proceedings would result in an unfair trial because of witness intimidation. The broadcast is allowed under an experimental program approved by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] last month that allows cameras in civil, non-jury cases. The case, <a href="https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> [case materials], is set to go to trial on Monday.<br /><br />Last month, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-denies-disclosure-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex marriage proponents cannot access Proposition 8 supporters&#39; internal campaign communications. The court denied disclosure of the documents on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] grounds, reversing a decision by Walker. In November, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ninth-circuit-upholds-ruling-to-block.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] Walker&#39;s denial of a motion to intervene in the suit by conservative advocacy group the Campaign for California Families. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/bush-gore-lawyers-file-prop-8-challenge.php">lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] in May by former US solicitor general <a href="http://www.gibsondunn.com/Lawyers/tolson">Ted Olson</a> and prominent litigator <a href="http://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/data/0001">David Boies</a> [professional profiles], who were opposing counsel in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html">Bush v. Gore</a> [opinion], which decided the outcome of the contested <a href="/election2000.htm">2000 US Presidential election</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/marshals/">US Marshals Service</a> [official website] will <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_COURTHOUSE_SECURITY?SITE=TXKER&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">conduct an extensive review</a> [AP report] of courthouse security nationwide, Assistant Director for Judicial Security <a href="http://www.justice.gov/marshals/contacts/bio/prout.htm">Michael Prout</a> [official profile] told the Associated Press on Wednesday. The announcement of a security review comes just two days after a courthouse official was killed and a deputy marshal was wounded in an <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/courthouse-shooting-80624367.html">attack on a Las Vegas courthouse</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Las Vegas Review-Journal</span> report]. In his comments, Prout noted that while the Las Vegas courthouse had modern security measures that aided in reducing the potential harm from the attack, that is not the case in many courthouses nationwide. No timetable was given for the the initiation of the review.<br /><br />The attack on the Las Vegas courthouse occurred the same day that the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/threats-againsts-us-judges-and.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] showing that the number of threats against judges and attorneys had more than doubled over the past six years. That report was critical of the US Marshals Service for not providing an appropriate response or coordinating with other law enforcement agencies. Courthouse security has become a significant issue as judges have increasingly become the targets of violence. In 2008, Brian Nichols was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-sentences-atlanta-gunman.php">sentenced to seven life terms</a> to be served consecutively for <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-judge-shot-in-atlanta.php">shooting and killing a federal judge</a> [JURIST reports] and other personnel in an Atlanta courthouse in an attempted escape. In April 2008, Ohio resident David Tuason was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/ohio-man-indicted-for-threatening-to.php">indicted for allegedly threatening to blow up the US Supreme Court building</a> [JURIST report] and attack black men, including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Civil rights groups on Monday opposed <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/010310_statement.shtm">stricter screening procedures</a> [TSA press release] for passengers entering the US from 14 countries, calling the measures unconstitutional. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/airline-security-must-protect-rights-well-safety">called on</a> [press release] the US government to &quot;adhere to longstanding standards of individualized suspicion and enact security measures that are the least threatening to civil liberties and are proven to be effective.&quot; Former FBI agent and national security policy counsel with the ACLU Michael German said:<br /><blockquote><br />Singling out travelers from a few specified countries for enhanced screening is essentially a pretext for racial profiling, which is ineffective, unconstitutional and violates American values. Empirical studies of terrorists show there is no terrorist profile, and using a profile that doesn&#39;t reflect this reality will only divert resources by having government agents target innocent people. Profiling can also be counterproductive by undermining community support for government counterterrorism efforts and creating an injustice that terrorists can exploit to justify further acts of terrorism.<br /></blockquote><br /><a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] National Executive Director Nihad Awad <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=26185&&name=n&&currPage=1&&Active=1">said</a> [press release] that the new screening measures amount to &quot;religious profiling&quot; against Muslims. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] maintained that the new procedures do <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/01/04/tsa.measures.muslims/index.html">not amount to racial or ethnic profiling</a> [CNN report]. Pro-troop advocacy group <a href="http://www.moveamericaforward.org/">Move America Forward</a> (MAF) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.moveamericaforward.org/release.php?id=15">responded</a> [press release] that &quot;law enforcement [needs] to have the freedom and ability to scrutinize and follow up on anyone without fear of being labeled a &#39;racist&#39; or &#39;profiling.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />The enhanced screening procedures, which will affect travelers entering the US from Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, come after Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 last month. Abdulmutallab has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-files-charges-in-attempted-detroit.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with willfully attempting to destroy an aircraft or aircraft facilities in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000032----000-.html">18 USC &sect; 32</a> [text]. Last week, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-outlines-measures-taken-following.php">announced steps</a> [JURIST report] the federal government is taking to address air travel security following the incident. He said that as soon as the attempted attack was discovered, officials increased screening requirements and increased the number of air marshals aboard flights. He also confirmed that he had ordered the review of how the US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=no-fly">no-fly list</a> [JURIST news archive] is managed as well as screening and other security procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Tuesday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-security-reviews">pledged to improve</a> [transcript] airline passenger security, calling last month&#39;s attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 &quot;a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence.&quot; Obama said that the US government had sufficient information to uncover the plot, but that &quot;our intelligence community failed to connect those dots.&quot; According to a review of the terrorist watch list system being conducted by Obama&#39;s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser John Brennan, the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, should have been placed on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=no-fly">no-fly list</a> [JURIST news archive]. Obama said that the terrorist watch list has already been reviewed and that more individuals have been added to the no-fly list. Obama called for initial reviews to be completed this week, with specific recommendations for corrective action. He concluded:<br /><blockquote><br />In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems - and the people in them - to be accountable and to work as intended: collecting, sharing, integrating, analyzing, and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocent lives - not just most of the time, but all the time. That&#39;s what the American people deserve. As President, that&#39;s exactly what I will demand.<br /></blockquote><br />Obama also confirmed that the US will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspending the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of prisoners from <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> to <a href="/countries/yemen.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archives], but promised to continue to work toward closing the facility.<br /><br />On Monday, civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/010310_statement.shtm">stricter screening procedures</a> [TSA press release] for passengers entering the US from 14 countries, calling the measures unconstitutional.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar on Tuesday warned opposition activists that they could execution if they continue anti-government protests. Najjar&#39;s <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE60420L20100105">statement</a> [Reuters report] came one day after the Intelligence Ministry announced that <a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=211350">several foreigners</a> [<em>Tehran Times</em> report] were among those arrested in last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/done-four-killed-hundreds-arrested-in.php">violent protests</a> [JURIST report]. Najjar said that the foreigners would also face punishment if found guilty of crimes. The protests, which were the largest since those that followed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">June presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive], interrupted the Shia Muslim celebration of Ashura, which marks the seventh century death of the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s grandson Hussein. The protests resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries, and more than 300 arrests. Among those reported dead is the 35-year-old nephew of opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mir+hossein">Mir Hossein Mousavi</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years. In September, human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of rights violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">beatings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-forcing-confessions-from-political.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/pressoffice/district_court_opinion_01052010.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the majority of restrictions on cigarette advertising imposed by the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1256enr.txt.pdf">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> [text, PDF]. The upheld limitations include a ban on distributing clothing and goods with logos or brand names affixed, as well as sponsorship of cultural, athletic, and social events. In finding that these restrictions did not violate the First Amendment, Judge Joseph McKinley wrote, &quot;the Act&#39;s ban on free samples clearly regulates the distribution of a product, not speech&#8212;and, even if thought of as a speech restriction, it would seem fully permissible as a restriction on price, i.e., tobacco products cannot be free.&quot; McKinley did permit the continued use of color and graphics in tobacco advertisements and labels, striking down those portions of the law by quoting the Supreme Court&#39;s language from <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/447/557/case.html">Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric v. Public Service Commission</a> [opinion text], &quot;The State cannot regulate speech that poses no danger to the asserted state interest ... nor can it completely suppress information when narrower restrictions on expression would serve its interest as well.&quot; The ruling was seen as a victory for anti-smoking groups such as the <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/index.php">Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/Script/DisplayPressRelease.php3?Display=1187">called the decision</a> [press release], &quot;a significant victory for public health.&quot; The tobacco companies involved in the suit, including <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a> [corporate website], have not released statements on the decision.<br /><br />Judge McKinley&#39;s decision comes only four months after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/tobacco-companies-file-lawsuit-claiming.php">suit was filed</a> [JURIST report] claiming the new tobacco law violated the First Amendment. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009, the culmination of many years of debate on the merits and authority of the Food and Drug Administration to oversee the tobacco industry. The bill was first <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/house-panel-approves-tobacco-regulation.php">voted out of committee</a> [JURIST report] in the House in April 2008, while a Senate committee <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-senate-panel-backs-fda-tobacco.php">approved a version of the bill</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Wednesday that Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has been <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/News/Docs/indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] on six counts for allegedly attempting to set off an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bound from Amsterdam to Detroit last month. Abdulmutallab has been charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-nsd-004.html">said</a> [press release]:<br /><blockquote><br />The charges that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab faces could imprison him for life. This investigation is fast-paced, global and ongoing, and it has already yielded valuable intelligence that we will follow wherever it leads. Anyone we find responsible for this alleged attack will be brought to justice using every tool - military or judicial - available to our government.<br /></blockquote><br />Abdulmutallab could be arraigned as early as Friday before the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website].<br /><br />On Tuesday, US President Barack Obama pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-pledges-to-improve-air-security.php">improve airline passenger security</a> [JURIST report], calling the attempted bombing &quot;a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence.&quot; Obama said that the US government had sufficient information to uncover the plot, but that &quot;our intelligence community failed to connect those dots.&quot; On Monday, civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/010310_statement.shtm">stricter screening procedures</a> [TSA press release] for passengers entering the US from 14 countries, calling the measures unconstitutional. The enhanced screening procedures will affect travelers entering the US from Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201001/09-5051-1223587.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the president has broad authority to detain suspected terrorists, finding that the detention of Yemeni <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/128-ghaleb-nassar-al-bihani#1">Ghaleb Nassar Al-Bihani</a> [NYT materials] is authorized under domestic law. In its first Guantanamo <em>habeas</em> ruling since the US Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf"><u>Boumediene v. Bush</u></a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] in 2008, the appeals court affirmed the lower court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-yemeni-guantanamo.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by Judge Richard Leon to deny Al-Bihani&#39;s petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>. The three-judge panel of the DC Circuit found that &quot;Al-Bihani was both part of and substantially supported enemy forces.&quot; The court also found that the scope of the president&#39;s detention authority is not constrained by international law, and that the government&#39;s burden of proof in <em>habeas</em> proceedings is only a preponderance of the evidence standard. While all three members of the panel concurred in the result, one member wrote separately to question the court&#39;s conclusion that international laws of war have no impact on the president&#39;s detention authority. An appeal is expected, which could result in a rehearing by the full appeals court.<br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s ruling will have an impact on future <em>habeas</em> cases brought in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], where different judges have been applying their own standards since the <u>Boumediene</u> decision. In May, Judge John Bates <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-judge-rejects-new-government.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration&#39;s &quot;substantial support&quot; standard. Earlier that month, Judge Gladys Kessler <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-judge-adopts-new-standard-in.php">applied the &quot;substantially supported&quot; standard</a> [JURIST report] for reviewing <em>habeas</em> petitions filed by detainees, making no reference to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enemy+combatant">&quot;enemy combatant&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] classification used previously. In April, Judge Reggie Walton also <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/federal-judge-adopts-obama.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] the &quot;substantially supported&quot; standard for authorizing and reviewing detention of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/01/05/06-35669.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a Washington law that prohibits felons from voting violates <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/voting/sec_2/about_sec2.php">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> [text]. The Washington law, Article VI, Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/lawsandagencyrules/pages/constitution.aspx">state constitution</a> [text], states that, &quot;All persons convicted of infamous crime unless restored to their civil rights and all persons while they are judicially declared mentally incompetent are excluded from the elective franchise.&quot; Washington <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=29A.04.079">defines</a> [text] an infamous crime as one, &quot;punishable by death in the state penitentiary or imprisonment in a state correctional facility.&quot; In issuing its opinion, the Ninth Circuit noted that despite the state&#39;s efforts to amend the law to reduce the discriminatory effect, &quot;it does not protect minorities from being denied the right to vote upon conviction by a criminal justice system that Plaintiffs have demonstrated is materially tainted by discrimination and bias.&quot; Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/office/osos_news.aspx?i=Z%2fpyBM45IM8Ap1%2fTMW9Vpw%3d%3d">expressed surprise</a> [press release] at the decision, and the state is expected to appeal.<br /><br />Felon voting rights are <a href="http://felonvoting.procon.org/viewresource.asp?resourceID=000286">varied throughout the US</a> [ProCon backgrounder], with 12 states completely restricting the right to vote depending on the crime committed, while Maine and Vermont allow all felons to vote, including those still serving their prison sentences. In October 2008, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] released a report showing <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/reports-find-widespread.php">widespread disenfranchisement</a> [JURIST report] among ex-convicts, including most prominently a lack of knowledge of state laws regarding voting rights. Earlier that year, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-challenges-alabama-felony.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging additions to Alabama&#39;s felon voting disenfranchisement law made by the state&#39;s attorney general. In February 2008, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/aclu-challenges-tennessee-voting-rights.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging that a Tennessee law that requires ex-convicts to pay all outstanding legal obligations before being granted the right to vote violates the Fourteenth Amendment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iranian parliamentary inquiry has found that Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi was <a href="http://alef.ir/1388/content/view/61410/">responsible for the deaths</a> [Alef report, in Persian] of at least three detainees involved in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">protests that followed the June 12 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive], the conservative Alef website reported Wednesday. The report alleges that Mortazavi, the prosecutor responsible for overseeing the Kahrizak prison, ordered that the prisoners be transferred to Kahrizak, where they were tortured and beaten to death. The Iranian government announced last month that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-prison-officials-charged-with.php">murder charges</a> [JURIST report] have been brought against 12 Kahrizak prison officials in connection with the deaths. The Iranian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iran-official-acknowledges-torture-of.php">acknowledged</a> [JURIST report] in August that the detainees had been tortured, yet initially claimed that the three men had died from meningitis. The prison coroner later found that the physical abuse was the sole cause of death for all three prisoners. Critics <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/19/iran.detainee.death.trial/">believe</a> [CNN report] that the charges are merely a political move by the Iranian government. <br /><br />The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the protests, which included thousands of arrests. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] the human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years. In September, human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of the violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">beatings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of the southern Philippine town of Datu Unsay, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 41 counts of murder related to the November massacre in Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/world/asia/06phils.html">allege</a> [NYT report] that Ampatuan and a large group of his men took a party of his opposition&#39;s supporters and journalists to a remote hilltop where the victims were murdered and buried. No live media coverage was allowed at the Quezon City regional trial court. The <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/236962/ampatuan-jr-pleads-not-guilty">trial will resume</a> [<em>Manila Bulletin</em> report] on January 13, when the prosecution is expected to call at least 12 witnesses in an attempt to block Ampatuan&#39;s petition for bail. Ampatuan is expected to be <a href="http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=538458&publicationSubCategoryId=63">charged with 57 counts of murder</a> [<em>Philippine Star</em> report], with the other murder complaints still pending before the Philippines <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?id1=1">Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website].<br /><br />Last week, the PDOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of more than 600 people charged with rebellion for allegedly interfering with government operations following the killings. Philippine <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> in the province in the wake of the killings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian High Court on Wednesday temporarily suspended enforcement of last week&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/malaysia-high-court-allows-non-muslims.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that non-Muslims can use the word &quot;Allah&quot; as a translation for the word &quot;God.&quot; The decision came after the Malaysian <a href="http://www.moha.gov.my/">Home Ministry</a> [official website, in Malay] sought a stay Tuesday. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/malaysia-court-accepts-catholic.php">case</a> [JURIST report] was brought by the <em>Herald</em>, a weekly Catholic publication, challenging the Malaysian government&#39;s three-year ban on the practice. The lawyer for the <em>Herald</em> said his clients has <a href="http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=42057">consented to the stay</a> [<em>Sun Daily</em> report]. The government also <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/malaysia-appeals-ruling-allowing-non.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] on Monday. The appeals court has not set a date for the hearing.<br /><br /><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Malaysia">Malaysia</a> [JURIST news archive], a Muslim-majority country, has struggled in recent years to find a balance between modernization and the policies of a more traditional Islamic government that has encouraged the spread of Sharia courts. Approximately 60 percent of Malaysians are Muslim, while Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus comprise about 35 percent of the population, falling under the jurisdiction of civil courts. Both civil and Sharia courts have the authority to address cases involving religious issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A White House spokesperson said Tuesday that the US government will suspend transfers of <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> detainees to <a href="/countries/yemen.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archives]. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs made the announcement at his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/briefing-white-house-press-secretary-robert-gibbs-1510">daily briefing</a> [transcript] amid increasing political pressure not to transfer any more detainees to Yemen after it was revealed that the man who attempted to detonate an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 last month received al Qaeda training in Yemen. Gibbs said:<blockquote>[O]ne of the very first things that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula used as a recruiting tool was the existence of Guantanamo Bay. ... [W]e are not going to make decisions about transfers that - to a country like Yemen that would - that they&#39;re not capable of handling. And I think that, while we remain committed to closing the facility, the determination has been made that right now any additional transfers to Yemen is not a good idea.</blockquote>Most of the nearly 200 detainees remaining at Guantanamo are Yemeni, and many detainees have been transferred back to Yemen. Earlier Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dc-circuit-upholds-broad-presidential.php">upheld the detention</a> [JURIST report] of Yemeni Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/128-ghaleb-nassar-al-bihani#1">Ghaleb Nassar Al-Bihani</a> [NYT materials], ruling that he can remain in US custody, but, last month, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">transferred six detainees</a> [JURIST report] back to Yemen. Also last month, a federal judge granted Yemeni detainee Saeed Hatim&#39;s petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-orders-release-of-yemeni.php">ordering his release</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />5:00 PM ET - US President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-security-reviews">confirmed</a> [transcript] that the US will suspend transfers of Guantanamo detainees to Yemen:<blockquote>With respect to Yemen in particular, there&#39;s an ongoing security situation which we have been confronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner.  Given the unsettled situation, I&#39;ve spoken to the Attorney General and we&#39;ve agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to Yemen at this time.</blockquote>Despite this announcement, Obama renewed his pledge to close the Guantanamo prison facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chief of Staff of the <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] Gabi Ashkenazi on Wednesday ordered the military to seek advice from legal advisers during battle, rather than just in the planning stages. Ashkenazi reportedly implemented the new regulations <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtVty.jhtml?sw=Ashkenazi+&itemNo=1140292">in spite of opposition</a> [Haaretz report] from several commanders. The decision follows widespread criticism of last year&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm">Operation Cast Lead</a> [Global Security Backgrounder] in the Gaza Strip, during which legal advisers were rarely consulted after combat began. The Israeli government has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/israel-hamas-committed-gaza-war-crimes.php">accused of committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report] and is seeking to avoid such accusations in the future. Under international law, a state is not subject to war crimes prosecution if it can demonstrate &quot;good faith&quot; in reviewing its own behavior.<br /><br />Wednesday&#39;s announcement comes one day after Israeli officials said that a military delegation recently canceled a trip to the UK over fears that they would be arrested on war crimes charges for their involvement in the Gaza offensive on the theory of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder], which allows a country to prosecute serious crimes against humanity no matter where the activity takes place. Last month, Former Israeli foreign minister <a href="http://tzipilivni.co.il/">Tzipi Livni</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a UK trip</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on war crimes charges relating to Israel&#39;s Gaza offensive. In October, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/11/Lieutenant-General%20Moshe%20Ya-alon">Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-cabinet-minister-cancels-uk-trip.php">called off</a> [JURIST report] a scheduled trip to the UK after legal advisers from the Israeli <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] said that he may be arrested over his involvement in a 2002 airstrike that killed a Hamas leader and 14 civilians. Just one week earlier, Palestinian officials <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1254163541545&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">attempted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem Post</span> report] to have Israeli <a href="http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/about_office/minister.asp">Defense Minister Ehud Barak</a> [official profile, in Hebrew] arrested on charges of war crimes while he was in Britain for a meeting with UK government leaders, but the British court rejected the petition citing Barak&#39;s diplomatic immunity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US security firm <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] on Wednesday reached a settlement agreement in seven federal lawsuits filed by Iraqi citizens. The suits claimed that Blackwater, now known as Xe, <a href="http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=20100107fd">created a reckless culture</a> [AP report] that resulted in numerous deaths, including the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST reports] in September 2007 and the 2006 killing of an Iraqi guard. The suits accused Blackwater founder Erik Prince of personal responsibility. The terms of the settlement have not been made public, but Xe said in a statement that it is &quot;pleased&quot; with the resolution.<br /><br />The settlement comes just a week after after a US judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissed charges</a> [JURIST reoprt] against five guards indicted for their involvement in the September 2007 killings. Judge Richardo Urbina of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/memorandum-of-dismissal-of-charges-against-blackwater-guards/original.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges against the five guards, finding that statements were obtained in violation of the Constitution. Earlier this week, Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] said that Iraq will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iraq-to-file-suits-against-blackwater.php">file lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] in both US and Iraqi courts against the guards. The five defendants <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/indicted-blackwater-guards-plead-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to manslaughter and weapons charges last January. The guards were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-indicts-five-blackwater-guards.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on charges of voluntary manslaughter, attempt to commit manslaughter, and using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. A sixth guard pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US authorities on Thursday <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/Pressreleases/01-JanuaryPDFArchive/10/20100107cannonnr.html">announced</a> [press release] charges against two former employees of security firm <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] in connection with the May 5 shooting death of two Afghans in Kabul. Justin Cannon and Christopher Drotleff each face 13 counts under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/dss/meja/statute.html">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> (MEJA) [text], including two counts of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and discharging a firearm during a violent crime, for which they could receive life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. The men are accused of shooting three men, reportedly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iSY9uLcOD5zeW8DQ14R5-_bC6aQw">during a traffic incident</a> [AFP report], while working for Blackwater subsidiary <a href="http://paravantllc.com/">Paravant LLC</a> [corporate website], under contract with the US <a href="http://www.dod.gov">Department of Defense</a> [official website] to provide weapons training to the <a href="http://www.mod.gov.af/">Afghan National Army</a> [official website]. Also on Thursday, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/mercenaries/">Working Group on the use of mercenaries</a> [official website] responded to an announcement earlier this week by Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] that his government would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iraq-to-file-suits-against-blackwater.php">file lawsuits</a> against Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, in both US and Iraqi courts for its involvement in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in September 2007 in Baghdad&#39;s Nisour Square.

The settlement came just a week after after a US judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissed charges</a> [JURIST report] against five guards indicted for their involvement in the Nisour Square killings.

The five defendants <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/indicted-blackwater-guards-plead-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to manslaughter and weapons charges last January.

A sixth guard pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iranian judiciary said Thursday that five people arrested during in last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/done-four-killed-hundreds-arrested-in.php">violent riots</a> [JURIST report] will be <a href="http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=100364">tried</a> [ILNA report] for Moharebe, or warring against God, which is punishable by execution. The names of the accused have not been released. The protests, which were the largest since those that followed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">June presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive], interrupted the Shia Muslim celebration of Ashura, which marks the seventh century death of the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s grandson Hussein. The protests resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries, and more than 300 arrests. Among those reported dead is the 35-year-old nephew of opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mir+hossein">Mir Hossein Mousavi</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this week, Iranian Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-official-warns-opposition.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] opposition activists that they could execution if they continue anti-government protests, and there is speculation that the severe charges are an attempt to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/world/middleeast/08iran.html">quash ongoing unrest</a> [NYT report].<br /><br />The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years. In September, human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of rights violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">beatings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-forcing-confessions-from-political.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The New Jersey Senate <a href="http://videos.nj.com/star-ledger/2010/01/new_jersey_state_senators_vote.html">voted 20-14</a> [video] Thursday to defeat a <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/S2000/1967_I1.PDF">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would have legalized <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The Senate Judiciary Committee had <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-jersey-senate-committee-approves.php">voted 7-6 in favor of the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month, marking the first time that any body in the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/">state legislature</a> [official website] had approved same-sex marriage legislation. The bill&#39;s sponsors, Democratic senators Raymond Lesniak and Loretta Weinberg, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-jersey-senate-postpones-same-sex.php">postponed the vote</a> [JURIST report], saying they wanted to allow a hearing in the general assembly before the vote took place. Supporters had hoped to pass the legislation before outgoing Governor Jon Corzine (D) leaves office on January 19. He had promised to sign the bill, but Governor-elect Chris Christie (R) opposes it, making same-sex marriage unlikely in New Jersey for at least the next four years.<br /><br />Last month, the New York Senate also <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">defeated legislation</a> [JURIST report] to allow same-sex marriage. In November, Maine voters <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill passed by that state&#39;s legislature. The Maine vote came a year after California voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved Proposition 8</a>, an amendment to the state constitution overturning the state&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">high court ruling</a> [JURIST reports] in favor of same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, and is set to become legal in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports], pending Congressional inaction.

Obaidullah was initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-military-charges-afghan-detainee-at.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] by the military in 2008 with hiding and storing anti-tank mines to be deployed against US forces in Afghanistan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/welcome.html">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/09_News_Releases/010610.html">announced new rules</a> [press release] for obtaining leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands. The new rules were designed to provide a greater public voice in deciding how the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) [official website] awards these leases. In a statement, Salazar said, &quot;[w]e need a fresh look &#8211; from inside the federal government and from outside &#8211; at how we can better manage Americans&#39; energy resources.&quot; The announced <a href="http://www.doi.gov/documents/BLM_Energy_Reform_Fact_sheet.pdf">changes</a> [fact sheet, PDF] are extensive and include a required comprehensive review of each site, &quot;public participation, an interdisciplinary review of available information, confirmation of Resource Management Plan (RMP) conformance, and national, state, and local guidance.&quot; Additionally, the new guidelines will increase oversight over so-called categorical exclusions, implemented under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a> [text, PDF], which permit projects on federal land without extensive environmental review. The implemented changes to leasing policy will take effect immediately. <br /><br />The genesis of the new leasing policy occurred in February 2009, when Salazar <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/04/AR2009020401785.html">voided leases</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report] on 77 parcels of federal land in Utah. In describing his motivation, Salazar said in a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/09_News_Releases/020409b.html">statement</a> [text] that the need for energy dependence must be balanced with the need to protect our public lands. Also in February, Salazar <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-to-reverse-bush.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration to reverse offshore drilling policies established by former US president <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] at the end of his presidency. The new strategy involves extending the public comment period on the proposed five-year plan for oil and gas development on the Alaskan Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by 180 days, assembling a detailed report from Department of the Interior agencies on conventional and renewable offshore energy resources, holding four regional conferences to review these findings, and expediting renewable energy rulemaking for the OCS.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] has requested federal assistance to pay more than $200 million annually for security for the upcoming trial of five <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] suspects, according to a <a href="/pdf/bloombergombletter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] made public Wednesday. Bloomberg sent the letter to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) Tuesday, estimating that security would cost about $216 million for the first year and $206 million per year in subsequent years, with most of the funds covering the cost of personnel. Bloomberg wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />The City of New York&#39;s financial resources are in short supply, and we have been forced to reduce our Police Department&#39;s headcount. Thus, securing the trial will require us to pull existing personnel from crime prevention efforts around the City and require significant overtime expenses. As 9/11 was an attack on the entire nation, we need the federal government to shoulder the significant costs we will incur and ease this burden.<br /></blockquote><br />The letter was also sent to US Attorney General Eric Holder, Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), and others. A spokesperson for the OMB said that the federal government will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/nyregion/07terror.html">share responsibility</a> [NYT report] for funding security for the trial. No trial date has been set.<br /><br />Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that the government would pursue federal charges against the five suspected 9/11 conspirators in a Manhattan district. Holder said that he recommended that the men be tried in civilian court after a case-by-case review conducted by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official websites], according to a new protocol announced in July. Reactions to the decision have fallen mostly along partisan lines, with many Republicans <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/republicans-opposing-federal-trial-for.php">opposing the plan</a> [JURIST report], and many Democrats supporting it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.china-embassy.ch/eng/">Chinese Embassy in Switzerland</a> [official website] on Friday warned that Switzerland would jeopardize relations with China by accepting two <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur Guantanamo Bay detainees</a> [JURIST news archive]. Switzerland has already <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-to-accept-uzbek-guantanamo.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to accept an Uzbek Guantanamo detainee, who will be relocated to the canton of Geneva, but authorities from the canton of Jura made a public statement last month expressing willingness to take two Uighur brothers. Since then, the Chinese embassy has issued repeated <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/index/China_warns_Swiss_over_asylum_cases.html?cid=8033232">warnings</a> [SwissInfo report] to Swiss authorities cautioning against accepting the Uighurs. Public reaction in Switzerland is ambivalent, with some calling for Switzerland to stay away from an American-created problem and others appealing to human rights and <a href="http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/suisse-va-ceder-215479">maintaining</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Le Matin</font> report, in French] a position independent of Chinese pressure.<br /><br />Of the 22 Uighurs originally detained at Guantanamo Bay, 15 have been relocated. Six Uighurs were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">transferred to Palau</a> in October, four were <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">sent to Bermuda</a> last June, and five were <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">received by Albania</a> [JURIST reports] in 2006. China has continued to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-again-calls-for-return-of-uighur.php">call for repatriation</a> [JURIST report] of the Uighur detainees that Chinese authorities consider to be part of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9179/east_turkestan_islamic_movement_etim.html">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a>  (ETIM) [CFR backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and which has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. The US has previously rejected China&#39;s calls to repatriate the Uighurs, citing fear of torture upon their return. In November, four Uighurs at Guantanamo filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-seek.php">petition for <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court, challenging an appellate ruling that prohibited courts from preventing the transfer of detainees to foreign countries for fear of persecution or torture.

The petitioner, Brian Dolan, attacked a hitchhiker and was ordered to pay restitution to his victim.

The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/08/08-2104.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that &quot;a tardy restitution order is not an invalid one.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Thursday called for stricter airline security measures as he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/07/release-security-review-conducted-after-failed-christmas-terrorist-attack-0">announced</a> [press release] the conclusion of two security reviews he <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-outlines-measures-taken-following.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] after the failed attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to detonate an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 last month. According to an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/summary_of_wh_review_12-25-09.pdf">unclassified summary</a> [text, PDF], the reviews found that the US counter-terrorism community had sufficient information about Abdulmutallab and <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/12/2009122935812371810.html">Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Penninsula</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder], the terrorist group with which he was affiliated, to disrupt the plot but failed to &quot;identify, correlate, and fuse into a coherent story all of the discrete pieces of intelligence&quot; held by US intelligence agencies. Saying that the failure to disrupt the plot &quot;was not the fault of a single individual or organization, but rather a systemic failure across organizations and agencies,&quot; Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-strengthening-intelligence-and-aviation-security">outlined</a> [remarks] a series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/potus_directive_corrective_actions_1-7-10.pdf">directives</a> [text, PDF] he authorized to address the security lapses identified by the reviews. He said he had ordered the intelligence community to assign &quot;specific responsibility for investigating all leads on high-priority threats,&quot; to rapidly and widely distribute intelligence reports, to rework their analytical processes to ensure integration of intelligence, and to &quot;strengthen the criteria used to add individuals to our terrorist watchlists.&quot; At a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/briefing-homeland-security-secretary-napolitano-assistant-president-counterterroris">joint press conference</a> [transcript] Thursday, assistant to the president for counterterrorism and Homeland Security John Brennan said that the systemic failures at issue in the December 25 attempt were distinct from the failure to share information between agencies outlined by the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/">9/11 Commission</a> [official website] as contributing to the success of those attacks. Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] described the use of watchlists as &quot;the cornerstone of our efforts to prevent suspected terrorists from boarding airplanes bound for the United States&quot; and said that her department would be working with the broader intelligence community to re-evaluate the procedures which trigger placement on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=no-fly">no-fly list</a> [JURIST news archive], and increasing efforts to strengthen international aviation security standards. <br /><br />On Wednesday, Abdulmutallab was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] on six counts for allegedly attempting to set off an explosive device concealed on his person on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. On Monday, civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/010310_statement.shtm">stricter screening procedures</a> [TSA press release] for passengers entering the US from 14 countries, calling the measures unconstitutional. The enhanced screening procedures will affect travelers entering the US from Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Abdulmutallab was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-files-charges-in-attempted-detroit.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] last month with willfully attempting to destroy an aircraft or aircraft facilities in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000032----000-.html">18 USC &sect; 32</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Honduran prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges against three military chiefs in connection with the ouster of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123134.stm">Manuel Zelaya</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zelaya">news archive</a>] in June. The attorney general&#39;s office <a href="http://www.elheraldo.hn/Sintesis/Lo-ultimo/Ediciones/2010/01/07/Noticias/Junta-de-comandantes-es-acusada-por-expatriar-a-Manuel-Zelaya-Rosales">filed abuse of power charges</a> [<em>El Heraldo</em> report, in Spanish] in the Honduran <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] against armed forces commander Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, air force commander Venancio Cervantes, and naval commander Luis Javier Prince. According to the charges, the three violated the <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html">Honduran Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] when they seized Zelaya and put him on a plane to Costa Rica because the constitution prohibits the forcible removal of a citizen. Zelaya has <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/military-chiefs-charged-over-honduran-coup-20100107-lwut.html">dismissed the charges as a political move</a> [AFP report], claiming the prosecutors share as much responsibility as the military. The court has three days to decide whether to take up the case.<br /><br />Zelaya remains in Honduras at the Brazilian embassy. Last month, the Honduran <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] voted 111-14 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/honduras-congress-rejects-zelaya.php">not to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] him. This followed a non-binding advisory opinion from the Supreme Court that Zelaya could <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/honduras-high-court-rules-zelaya-cannot.php">not legally return to office</a> [JURIST report]. Zelaya&#39;s return to power appears unlikely, as elections were held in November, and Porfirio Lobo is due to be sworn in as president later this month. Zelaya was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] in June, following a <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/general/noticias/Comunicado_Especial.htm">judicial order</a> [press release, in Spanish] asserting that he had broken Honduran law by attempting to conduct a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/honduras-president-proposes-vote-on.php">referendum on constitutional reform</a> [JURIST report], contrary to a Supreme Court ruling. Zelaya, along with the US, the UN, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the European Union, maintain that his removal was a coup, while the interim government of Roberto Micheletti asserts that it was a lawful transition of power.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Portuguese <a href="http://www.parlamento.pt/Paginas/default.aspx">Parliament</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on Friday approved a bill to legalize <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. The bill gives same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual married couples, but stops short of allowing same-sex couples to adopt. The bill was <a href="http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1465015">supported</a> [<em>Diario de Noticias</em> report, in Portuguese] by the ruling Socialist Part and other leftist parties and faced strong oppositions from conservatives as well as the Catholic Church. The bill will now be reviewed in committee before undergoing a final parliamentary vote. It will then go before President Anibal Cavaco Silva to be signed.<br /><br />In August, the Portuguese <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.pt/tc/home.html">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website, in Portuguese] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/portugal-high-court-upholds-same-sex.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex marriage is not a right guaranteed by the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html">Portuguese Constitution</a> [text], denying an appeal by a lesbian couple claiming sexual orientation discrimination. In October 2008, parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/portugal-parliament-votes-down.php">voted overwhelmingly against</a> [JURIST report] two opposition proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. If the bill is given final approval, Portugal would become the sixth European country to recognize same-sex marriage, joining Belgium, the Netherlands, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/norway-parliament-approves-same-sex.php">Norway</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Sweden</a> [JURIST reports].

		<title>Switzerland court rules UBS disclosure of client information was illegal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.admin.ch/index.html?lang=de">Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in German] ruled Friday that the <a href="http://www.finma.ch/d/seiten/default.aspx">Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority</a> (FINMA) [official website, in German] violated the law in February 2009 when it ordered <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] to disclose information to the US on more than 250 of the bank&#39;s clients. FINMA issued the order after the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] accused UBS of assisting Americans in hiding accounts from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website]. The court <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100108-704852.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines">stated</a> [WSJ report] that FINMA lacked the authority to authorize the release of information, and that the issue should have been addressed by the Federal Council. FINMA contends the move was necessary to ensure the stability of the Swiss banking system <a href="http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Pages/mm-entscheid-bvger-20100108.aspx">stating</a> [press release]: <blockquote>FINMA based its decision on Articles 25 and 26 of the Swiss Banking Act, which give it the authority and obligation to impose unspecified preventive measures if it has reasonable grounds to suspect serious liquidity problems. These measures may affect individual creditors&#39; rights same as payment moratoriums or payment bans which, unlike the &quot;preventive measures&quot;, have been specified in law. Following consultation with the Federal Council, the FINMA Board of Directors ordered the disclosure of the client data as it considered this as the only way to avoid the real threat of the US authorities starting proceedings against the bank, which would have threatened its existence and seriously worsened its liquidity situation which, in turn, would have impacted the Swiss economy.</blockquote> FINMA has indicated they will consider appealing the decision to the Federal Supreme Court. <br /><br />This ruling comes as the US seeks to put an end to tax-evasion through the use of overseas accounts. In November, the DOJ and IRS <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-lauds-success-of-irs-amnesty-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that more than 14,700 Americans have reported to the IRS previously hidden overseas bank accounts in response to a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=206012,00.html">temporary forgiveness program</a> [official website], allowing delinquent taxpayers to avoid criminal prosecution for tax evasion by paying all overdue taxes and penalties. In September, the US and Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-switzerland-sign-treaty-on-sharing.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the amount of information shared between the two nations on would-be tax evaders. The agreement, constructed in accordance with Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/57/42219418.pdf">Model Tax Convention</a> [text, PDF], came one month after a Swiss banker and lawyer were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/swiss-banker-lawyer-charged-with.php">indicted in US federal court</a> [JURIST report] for helping clients hide assets. Earlier in August, the US reached a preliminary agreement with Switzerland over the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-reaches-deal-with-switzerland-over.php">identification of anonymous accounts</a> [JURIST report] in Swiss banks, which would aid US officials in identifying those who seek to evade taxes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=3&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=42375991&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=25965/04&sessionid=42376031&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] Thursday that sex trafficking violates conventions against slavery and forced labor, finding both Russia and Cyprus liable in the case of a young woman who came from Russia to work in a Cyprus cabaret and was later found dead. The case was brought by the woman&#39;s father, who had campaigned for both countries to investigate her death. The court found that both Russia and Cyprus violated Article 4 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits slavery and forced labor. The ECHR ruled that Cyprus did not have a proper framework in place to prevent sex trafficking, and that authorities had reason to know the woman may have been a victim of sex trafficking and did not do enough to protect her. The court ruled that Russia did not do enough to identify where the woman was recruited and punish the responsible parties. The court also found that Cyprus violated the woman&#39;s right to life under Article 2 of the Convention by failing to investigate her death. The court ordered Cyprus to pay the woman&#39;s father 40,000 euros and Russia to pay 2,000 euros. Cyprus <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/story.html?id=2416190">admitted responsibility</a> [AFP report] the ruling and promised to investigate the woman&#39;s death.<br /><br />Sex trafficking is illegal in most European countries, but many women continue to come from Russia and Ukraine to work in Cyprus cabarets. In 2008, European Human Rights Commissioner <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official website] <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1385749&Site=CommDH&BackColorInternet=FEC65B&BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&BackColorLogged=FFC679">criticized</a> [report] Cyprus&#39;s artiste visa program, which he said facilitated illegal sex trafficking. Cyprus ended the program that year, but that only took effect in November.

		<title>More ex-Guantanamo detainees returning to terrorism: Pentagon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An official from the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] said Wednesday that about one in five detainees freed from the US military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] have returned to terrorist activities, according to a new Pentagon report. The report, which remains classified, shows an increase from the 14 percent recidivism rate reported last spring. That number was up from 11 percent in December 2008. The report was <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/01/gitmo-recidivism-rate-rises-to-20-percent-confirmed-to-abc.html">completed in late December</a> [ABC News report], and officials have not released the raw numbers on which the 20 percent figure is based. Many human rights groups <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-guantanamo-repeaters7-2010jan07,0,5047537.story">dispute the numbers</a> [LAT report], calling them inflated, and some reports have suggested that many Guantanamo <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/innocent-prisoners-being-held-at.php">detainees are innocent</a> [JURIST report], never having engaged in terrorist activities in the first place.<br /><br />News of the latest report comes just a day after the White House announced that it was suspending transfers of Guantanamo detainees to <a href="/countries/yemen.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive]. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs would <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/briefing-white-house-press-secretary-robert-gibbs-1610">not say</a> [press briefing] Wednesday whether that decision was due to fears that detainees would return to terrorist activities. Last year, the DOD said that the US would <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/us-to-continue-sending-guantanamo.php">not change its policy</a> [JURIST report] on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Saudi Arabia, despite reports that two former prisoners had joined al Qaeda in Yemen after undergoing a Saudi rehabilitation program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A plea of not guilty was entered in a US federal court Friday for Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/News/Docs/indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] on six counts for allegedly attempting to set off an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bound from Amsterdam to Detroit last month. Abdulmutallab is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. In his appearance before the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] Friday, Abdulmutallab refused to respond to the charges, and Judge Mark Randon entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Abdulmutallab will remain in custody, and no date has been set for his next hearing.<br /><br />On Thursday, US President Barack Obama called for stricter airline security measures as he <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">announced</a> the conclusion of two security reviews he ordered [JURIST reports] after the failed bombing attempt. On Tuesday, Obama pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-pledges-to-improve-air-security.php">improve airline passenger security</a> [JURIST report], calling the attempted bombing &quot;a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence.&quot; Obama said that the US government had sufficient information to uncover the plot, but that &quot;our intelligence community failed to connect those dots.&quot; On Monday, civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/010310_statement.shtm">stricter screening procedures</a> [TSA press release] for passengers entering the US from 14 countries, calling the measures unconstitutional. The enhanced screening procedures will affect travelers entering the US from Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Abdulmutallab was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-files-charges-in-attempted-detroit.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] last month with willfully attempting to destroy an aircraft or aircraft facilities in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000032----000-.html">18 USC &sect; 32</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] About 12 percent of youth held in US juvenile detention facilities reported being sexually abused in the past year, according to a <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/svjfry09.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/svjfry09pr.cfm">press release</a>] released Thursday the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> (BJS) [official website]. According to the report, about 2.6 percent of youth reported an incident involving another inmate, while 10.3 percent reported an incident involving staff. The BJS identified 13 facilities as having a &quot;high rate&quot; of sexual abuse, where the rate was nearly one in three youth. In response to the report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/07/us-1-10-children-juvenile-facilities-report-sexual-abuse-staff">urged</a> [press release] the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] &quot;to swiftly issue national standards to end prison rape. The DOJ Office of Justice Programs Review Panel on Prison Rape will <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-opa-007.html">review and conduct hearings</a> [press release] on the BJS report, as required by the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/programs/prisonrapeelimination.htm">Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003</a> (PREA) [DOJ backgrounder].<br /><br />In June, the <a href="http://nprec.us/">National Prison Rape Elimination Commission</a> (NPREC) [official website] reported that prison rape continues to be a widespread problem across the US, in both adult and juvenile facilities. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/first-circuit-rules-prison-may-restrict.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Massachusetts regulation prohibiting prisoners from receiving sexually explicit mail is constitutional. The Massachusetts prison commissioner defended the regulation on the grounds that it was designed to promote prison safety and security. The DOJ reported in 2006 that sexual violence in US prisons <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/prison-sexual-violence-often.php">often goes unreported</a> [JURIST report] because victims fear further abuse or do not trust prison staff. In 2005, the DOJ released its first <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/doj-releases-first-report-on-prison.php">report</a> [JURIST report] on prison rape in accordance with the PREA, but admitted that most incidents were probably never reported and that their numbers could not be reliably estimated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] on Thursday proposed <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/pdfs/20100106fr.pdf">stricter smog standards</a> [text, PDF] that would replace the Bush administration&#39;s broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. The new smog restrictions would reduce the amount of smog emissions to between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million (ppm) from the previous 0.075 ppm. The EPA estimates that these changes will help reduce the effects of climate change and improve public health, saving the US between $13 billion and $100 billion in health care costs. EPA <a href="http://blog.epa.gov/administrator/bio/">Administrator Lisa Jackson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/d70b9c433c46faa3852576a40058b1d4!OpenDocument">defended</a> [press release] the tighter restrictions:<br /><blockquote><br />EPA is stepping up to protect Americans from one of the most persistent and widespread pollutants we face. Smog in the air we breathe poses a very serious health threat, especially to children and individuals suffering from asthma and lung disease. It dirties our air, clouds our cities, and drives up our health care costs across the country. Using the best science to strengthen these standards is a long overdue action that will help millions of Americans breathe easier and live healthier.<br /></blockquote><br />The proposed regulations face much <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0714264220100107">criticism</a> [Reuters report] from industry groups, such as coal, oil, and natural gas companies, that will have to spend billions of dollars to comply with the new standards. The EPA will hold three nationwide public hearings in early February and will receive public comment on the proposed rule for 60 days before any new regulations become official.<br /><br />The EPA announced in September that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/epa-to-review-national-smog-standards.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] national smog standards to ensure accuracy and public health. The decision to review the smog standards came in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/environmental-groups-states-sue-epa.php">legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] filed by <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of several environmental organizations. The suit alleged that the EPA ignored the input of top scientists before <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/epa-announces-stricter-smog-rule.php">issuing its smog regulations</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008. The EPA has the power to monitor ozone levels under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF]. Ground-level ozone, referred to as smog, has been linked to respiratory health issues and adverse effects on the environment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33423&Cr=sri+lanka&Cr1=">urged an investigation</a> [UN News Centre report] into possible Sri Lankan war crimes after authenticating a video of members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] being executed by members of the Sri Lankan military. Alston said that an investigation by experts in forensic pathology, forensic video analysis, and firearm evidence concluded that the video was authentic. Alston said: <br /><blockquote><br />Given these conclusions, and in light of the persistent flow of other allegations of extrajudicial executions by both sides during the closing phases of the war against the LTTE, I call for the establishment of an independent inquiry to carry out an impartial investigation into war crimes and other grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law allegedly committed in Sri Lanka.<br /></blockquote><br />The Sri Lankan government has strongly denied that the video is authentic, calling it a fraud perpetrated by the LTTE. In a <a href="http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2260&Itemid=75">statement</a> [text], the <a href="http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2260&Itemid=75">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] said &quot;the investigation carried out by a panel of experts appointed by the Sri Lankan authorities clearly establishes that the video is not authentic and has been doctored.&quot;<br /><br />Sri Lanka has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations originating from incidents that took place during the final months of the civil war by both the government and the rebel LTTE. In October, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/131025.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on the conflict, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/sri-lanka-urged-to-investigate-and.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lankan officials to investigate reports of human rights violations and war crimes and prosecute those responsible. While the government of Sri Lanka <a href="http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2195&Itemid=75">rejected</a> [statement] the findings of the report, <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/Writings_New.asp?Id=66">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] decided in October to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/sri-lanka-to-order-independent-probe-of.php">appoint an independent committee</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of human rights violations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/">New Jersey Legislature</a> [official website] on Monday approved a <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/S0500/119_I1.PDF">bill</a> [text, PDF]  that would legalize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive].  The legislation would allow doctors to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/nyregion/12marijuana.html">prescribe marijuana</a> [NYT report] to patients with chronic illnesses such as cancer, AIDS, Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis, which would be distributed through state-monitored dispensaries. Nonetheless, the measure is among the nation&#39;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122469487">stricter</a> [NPR report] medical marijuana laws, as it limits use to patients with specific types of severe chronic illnesses and forbids patients to grown their own marijuana or to use it in public. Despite some controversy, the bill passed easily in both houses, with a vote of 48-14 in the General Assembly and 25-13 in the State Senate. Democratic <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Jon Corzine</a> [official website] is set to sign the bill before leaving office next Tuesday, and it is expected to take effect within nine months. <br /><br />This legislation would make New Jersey the fourteenth US state to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/medicalmarijuanaact.pdf">expansion</a> [proposed legislation, PDF] of the state&#39;s existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine became the fifth state to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=8859286">allow dispensaries</a> [ABC News report], following California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. In October, US Attorney General Eric Holder issued <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. Ending such raids was one of President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/politics/primarysource/2007/08/all_democratic.html">campaign promises</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span> report], a view that differed sharply from the policy of the Bush administration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] on Sunday <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/Spokesman/2010/01/spokegvul100110.htm">announced</a> [press release] the construction of 70 miles of fence along Israel&#39;s border with Egypt in order to combat terrorism and illegal immigration. In explaining the purpose for the barrier, which has an estimated cost of more than $400 million USD, Netanyahu explained:<br /><blockquote><br />I decided to close Israel&#39;s southern border to infiltrators and terrorists after prolonged discussions with Government ministries and professional elements. This is a strategic decision to ensure the Jewish and democratic character of the State of Israel. Israel will remain open to war refugees but we cannot allow thousands of illegal workers to infiltrate into Israel via the southern border and flood our country.<br /></blockquote><br />Israeli police <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/11/israel-fence-egypt">estimate</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that 100 to 200 African migrants enter the country illegally every week from Egypt, mainly in search of employment. The fence is expected to run 30 miles southeast from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5122404.stm">Gaza Strip</a> [BBC backgrounder], and 30 miles northwest from the southern port city of Eilat. The gap between the two, around 100 miles in length, will be <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1141570.html">monitored</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report] by advanced surveillance equipment and radar. The influx of non-Jewish migrants into Israel has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/11/world/AP-ML-Israel-Egypt-Fence.html">caused unease</a> [NYT report] among Jewish Israelis, a group which comprises three-fourths of the Israeli population and wants to maintain the country as the world&#39;s only Jewish-majority state. <br /><br />Netanyahu&#39;s announcement comes in the wake of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Egyptian authorities last week over the delay of an aid convoy from Al-Arish, Egypt and an attempt to close off the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Under pressure from the US and Israel, Egypt has begun construction of an underground barrier to prevent tunneling by smugglers. As much as 60 percent of Israel&#39;s borders are <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/01/201011123810649163.html">closed by physical barriers</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report], including its borders with neighboring Lebanon, Jordan, the Gaza Strip, and most of the West Bank. The construction of a barrier between Israel proper and the West Bank commenced in 2002, and has continued despite an <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/update-world-court-rules-west-bank.htm">advisory opinion issued</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] in 2004 declaring the wall illegal under international law, and numerous <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/israel-high-court-allows-construction.php">domestic legal challenges</a> [JURIST report]. In 2008, The Israeli <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the government must <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/israel-high-court-orders-re-routing-of.php">change the proposed route</a> [JURIST report] for its West Bank security barrier, finding that the current plan encroaches too much on Palestinian territory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chief Justice of India <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/sitting/bkgopinathan.htm">KG Balakrishnan</a> [official profile] proposed on Saturday the creation of a new constitutional court to review matters relating to the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/in00000_.html">Indian Constitution</a> [text] and other federal issues. Balakrishnan also <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/10/stories/2010011057490100.htm">suggested</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] the creation of a television channel that would exclusively cover the <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=india+supreme+court">news archive</a>], similar to the channel that currently covers the Indian Parliament. The channel would provide the people with a better understanding of what judges do and at the same time make judges more accountable for their decisions. The proposed constitutional court would be similar to the system in South Africa, and would help ease the Supreme Court&#39;s load as more appeals are filed.<br /><br />The suggestions of the television channel and an increase in transparency in the court come as the Supreme Court faces criticism for judicial accountability. In November, judges of the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/india-supreme-court-judges-disclose.php">voluntarily made public disclosures</a> [JURIST report] of their <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/assets.htm">financial assets</a> [list]. Despite the release, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] questioned the benefit of disclosure when there is no way to confirm that it is entirely accurate, given the announcement that the judges will not entertain any <a href="http://www.judicialreforms.org/files/Mail_Today_SC_judges_reveal_their_assets.pdf">queries or scrutiny</a> [CJAR press release, PDF] of assets listed. In August, the judges made the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-supreme-court-judges-to-disclose.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] to go public with their assets, despite not being required to do so by Indian law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghan officials on Saturday <a href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/en/article/news/afghan-ministers-sign-memo-accept-responsibility-of-detention-facility-in-parwan.html">signed</a> [press release] a memorandum of understanding to delineate the process through which Afghanistan will take over the US military&#39;s Parwan Detention Center that was formerly housed at <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">news archive</a>]. The transfer of responsibilities may take place within <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/01/201011034736505629.html">six months</a> [Al Jazeera report], and will initially rely on the Afghan Ministry of Defense to run the facility. Afghan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/sroot_eng.aspx?id=166">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>] will determine the timing of the eventual transfer of complete responsibility for the Parwan Detention Centre to the Central Prisons Directorate in the Ministry of Justice. Afghan and US officials purport that the move will strengthen security and the rule of law in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The Parwan Detention Centre was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/obama-adminstration-to-open-new-bagram.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] in November, to replace the detention facility formerly located in a hangar at the Bagram Air Base. Even after the opening of the new detention facility, international human rights activists <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/news/us-reform-afghanistan-detention-policy-new-facility-opens-prisoner-rights-still-lacking">called on</a> [press release] the Obama administration to ensure that detention policies conform to international law. Reports of abuses at Bagram during the previous administration included the death of two detainees after severe beatings and prolonged detentions without trial or access to legal counsel. The Parwan Detention Centre instituted a system of <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/obama-administration-to-issue-new.php">personal representatives</a> [JURIST report] who are not lawyers but would explain the process to detainees and assist them in gathering any evidence to challenge their detention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A trial on the constitutionality of California&#39;s <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/8/#text">Proposition 8</a> [text] <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST archive] ban commenced Monday in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. Proceedings included opening statements from lead attorneys and <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14165465?source=most_viewed">testimony</a> [<em>San Jose Mercury News</em> report] from plaintiffs seeking the right to marry their same-sex partners. Judge Vaughn Walker, who is presiding over the Proposition 8 trial, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in October that the case could be heard in federal court. Walker has said the trial is necessary to ascertain the level of constitutional protection granted to same-sex couples. Testimony is expected to continue for several weeks.<br /><br />Because of the explosive impact the trial could have on same-sex marriage rights in the US, the start of the trial has engendered controversy over the broadcast of the proceedings. Earlier Monday, the US Supreme Court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the broadcast of the trial on the video-sharing site YouTube. The Court&#39;s decision overruled Judge Walker&#39;s earlier <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-trial.php">deicision</a> [JURIST report] to allow the trial to be recorded and posted on the District Court&#39;s YouTube channel. Proposition 8&#39;s supporters have argued that the trial&#39;s broadcast could lead to witness intimidation. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian law allowing minor offenders to serve their sentences under house arrest rather than in prison entered into force on Sunday. The bill, <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-passes-bill-allowing-house-arrest/396328.html">approved</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Moscow Times</span> report] by the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website; in Russian] last month and <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-passes-bill-allowing-house-arrest/396328.html">signed</a> [RIA Novosti report] by <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitri Medvedev</a> [official profile], is aimed at reducing the number of inmates in Russia&#39;s overcrowded prison system. Individuals charged with minor offenses will be able to serve between two months and four years confined in their homes, while courts will be allowed to utilize house arrest as part of a defendant&#39;s probationary period. Individuals sentenced to house arrest will be monitored by electronic bracelets with GPS tracking devices.  Among other restrictions, those convicted will have to notify authorities before changing their place of residency or job. <br /><br />Russia has the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/icps/downloads/world-prison-pop-seventh.pdf">second largest prison population</a> [list, PDF] per capita in the world, superseded only by the US, where <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prison+overcrowding">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be a problem. Last month, a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.cor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_of_corrections/4604">Pennsylvania Department of Corrections</a> [official website] said that the state will begin transferring prisoners out of state to reduce the prison population. In 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/california-begins-out-of-state.php">California also began transferring</a> [JURIST report] prisoners out of state. California is currently under a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">federal court order</a> [JURIST report] to reduce its prison population from 190 percent to 137.5 percent by 2011. In November, the California government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/california-files-new-plan-to-reduce.php">submitted a revised plan</a> [JURIST report] for reducing its prison population that includes revisions made possible because of legislative enactments, such as summary parole for lower-level offenses to reduce the amount of inmates re-entering the prison system for parole violations and credit-earning enhancements to reduce time served.

The NYT, along with the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], gathered information through the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] pertaining to more than 100 deaths that have occurred in the detention facilities since 2003. The NYT discovered that government officials had made deliberate attempts to conceal information from the media and the public, despite the Obama administration&#39;s promises to increase the transparency of such organizations. As a result, investigations have been conducted by the US Department of Justice&#39;s <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opr/index.html">Office of Professional Responsibility</a> and the US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official websites]. According to the NYT, such internal investigations provide further support that the culture of secrecy has continued in the current administration.<br /><br />In the face of criticism, the Obama administration has taken steps in recent months to improve conditions for immigrant detainees. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-immigration-detention-system.php">reports</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/default.asp">Constitution Project</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] indicated that the US immigration detention and transfer policies unnecessarily interfere with detainees&#39; rights to counsel and procedural fairness. In November, the US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/dhs-announces-plans-for-immigration.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the Obama administration will push for immigration reform legislation early next year. In August, the ICE <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ice-acknowledges-previously-unreported.php">acknowledged</a> [JURIST report] that 11 deaths in immigration detention centers had gone unreported. The admission came just a week after the ICE <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ice-announces-major-reforms-to.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that large-scale changes to the immigration detention system would take place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/011110zr.pdf">temporarily blocked</a> [order, PDF] an order allowing delayed video coverage of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8 trial</a> on the constitutionality of California&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] ban to be posted on YouTube. The court&#39;s decision to grant the stay overrules an order by Judge Vaughn Walker of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], who last week <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the trial could be recorded and posted on the court&#39;s YouTube channel. The block on posting coverage of the trial, which begins Monday in federal court in San Francisco, will remain in place until Wednesday, giving the justices additional time to weigh the issue. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, writing that he &quot;would undertake that consideration without a temporary<br />stay in place.&quot;<br /><br />Supporters of Proposition 8 have objected to the controversial decision to broadcast the trial proceedings, claiming it would result in witness intimidation. The YouTube broadcast of the case, <a href="https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> [case materials], is allowed under an experimental program approved by the<a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/"> US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] last month that allows cameras in civil, non-jury cases. Also last month, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-denies-disclosure-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex marriage proponents cannot access Proposition 8 supporters&#39; internal campaign communications. The court denied disclosure of the documents on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] grounds, reversing a decision by Walker. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.gov.rw/">Rwandan government</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.gov.rw/IMG/pdf/Mutsinzi_Report__MEDIA_GUIDE.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Monday concluding that the 1994 assassination of then-president <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9115483/Habyarimana-Juvenal">Juvenal Habyarimana</a> [Britannica profile] was the work of Hutu extremists. An independent committee of experts found that Hutu extremists, including members of the president&#39;s own family, were opposed to the <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/AF/profiles/Burundi/arusha.pdf">1993 Arusha Accords</a> [text, PDF], a power-sharing agreement supported by Habyarimana, designed to end his 20-year monopoly on power. The report asserts that Hutus used the assassination as a pretext for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1288230.stm">1994 genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>] in which more than 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, were killed in the span on 100 days. The report states that:<br /><blockquote><br />Members of the president&#39;s inner circle ... viewed the Accords as an existential threat to a Hutu-dominated Rwanda as well has their own political and economic standing. These men were not simply opposed to a reconciliation process; they were committed to the wholesale extermination of Tutsis. By the spring of 1994, they had the means, motive and opportunity to act ... and they did.<br /></blockquote><br />The committee&#39;s findings are consistent with conclusions of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unamir.htm">UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> (UNAMIR) [official website] that the parties responsible for bringing down the plane were Hutus. <br /><br />The committee of experts was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/rwanda-commission-to-investigate-1994.php">established</a> [JURIST report] by Rwanda&#39;s Tutsi <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/689405.stm">profile</a>] in April 2007 to investigate the downing of the plane carrying the Hutu leader. In 2006, the Rwandan government also <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/rwanda-begins-probe-into-alleged.php">began a probe</a> [JURIST report] into accusations that France assisted a Hutu massacre of Tutsis. In 2006, a French anti-terrorism judge <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/french-judge-recommends-rwanda.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that Kagame stand trial for the death of Habyarimana. Kagame denied any involvement. As of May 2009, the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>], established for the prosecution of persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law during the Rwandan genocide, has <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/completionstrat/s-2009-247e.pdf">rendered judgments or has trials underway</a> [completion strategy report, PDF] for 68 suspects, with six suspects awaiting trials, one retrial, and 13 fugitives.

		<title>First Circuit upholds civil commitment of sex offenders</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three judge panel from the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=09-1596P.01A">upheld</a> [opinion text] the constitutionality of provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00004248----000-.html">Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 4248 text], which allow a person deemed &quot;sexually dangerous&quot; to be civilly committed after the expiration of a federal criminal sentence. Two members of the panel found that civil commitments were within the power granted to Congress under the Constitution&#39;s <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Necessary and Proper Clause</a> [Article 1, Section 8] as an extension of the government&#39;s custodial responsibility for federal inmates. Likening the commitment of sex offenders to the continued hospitalization of an inmate suffering from a mental disease or defect under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00004246----000-.html">section 4246</a> [18 USC &sect; 4246 text], the court ruled that the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/350/366/case.html">Greenwood v. United States</a> [opinion text] recognizing federal authority to order civil commitments extends to sex offenders.<br /><blockquote><br />The exercise of a federal commitment power embodied in section 4248 operates to prevent the release into society at large of sexually dangerous persons as to whom the federal government has custodial responsibilities. Because that exercise is limited to cases in which the federal government has a custodial duty, and because the federal scheme respects state prerogatives in the field of civil commitment, we conclude that it is consistent with both the letter and spirit of the Constitution.<br /></blockquote><br />The court also noted that the federal government must defer to state authorities when seeking civil commitment, and therefore &sect; 4248 operates only as a &quot;gap-filler in situations in which states either cannot or do not wish to assume responsibility for sexually dangerous persons in federal custody.&quot;<br /><br />In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-to-hear-sex-offender.php">granted <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-1224.htm">United States v. Comstock</a> [docket], a Fourth Circuit case that <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fourth-circuit-finds-federal-civil.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the Walsh Act&#39;s civil commitment provisions under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [text]. In September 2007, the <a href="http://www.nced.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina</a> [official website] ruled that the commitment process was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/federal-sex-offender-commitment-law.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] on federalism grounds. In 1997, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-1649.ZS.html">Kansas v. Hendricks</a> [text] upheld the constitutionality of a state civil commitment process that allowed the state to confine, in a state mental hospital, sexually violent criminal offenders because the confinement was civil in nature and thus did not involve criminal punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] heard arguments on Monday in an appeal by multi-national corporations accused of assisting the South African government during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=apartheid">apartheid-era</a> [JURIST new archive]. The corporations, which include <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor Co.</a>, <a href="http://www.daimler.com/">Daimler</a> and <a href="http://www.gm.com/">General Motors Corp.</a> [corporate websites], are accused of aiding the human rights abuses committed by the South African government by continuing to do business with the country, despite knowledge that their products were being used to support apartheid. The court will first <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gCyPkAPMJPvuNcrBY94OQKpwL4xQ">determine</a> [AFP report] whether it has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The corporations argue the case should be dismissed because they cannot be held responsible for crimes committed by the South African government. The lawsuit was brought by South African plaintiffs under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1350.notes.html">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> (ATCA) [text].<br /><br />In April, the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/federal-judge-allows-apartheid-lawsuits.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the corporations&#39; motion to dismiss the case. Despite initial opposition to the complaint over potential harm to relations with the US and foreign investment in the country, the South African government now supports the action. In 2008, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] affirmed a Second Circuit judgment on the rare grounds that it <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/supreme-court-affirms-ruling-allowing.php">lacked quorum</a> [JURIST report], thus sending the case back to the SDNY. The Second Circuit&#39;s decision allowed the ATCA action to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-appeals-court-allows-apartheid.php">go forward to trial</a> [JURIST report], but had dismissed additional claims filed under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010_01_08_-_FINAL_Davis_Complaint.PDF">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-sues-library-congress-behalf-former-guantanamo-prosecutor">press release</a>] on Friday against the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/index.html">Library of Congress</a> [official website] on behalf <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/Jan2006/d20060111Davis.pdf">Col. Morris Davis</a> [official profile, PDF], the former chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">Guantanamo Bay military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Davis, who was employed at Library&#39;s <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/aboutcrs.html">Congressional Research Service</a> (CRS) [official website], resigned as the military commissions&#39; chief prosecutor in October 2007. Following his recognition, Davis became an outspoken critic of the commissions, including writing articles, giving speeches, and testifying before Congress that the system is fundamentally flawed. In the lawsuit, the ACLU alleges that Davis was terminated due to opinion pieces about the commissions. The ACLU believes that the discharge violates Davis&#39;s rights of free speech and due process. The complaint says:<br /><blockquote><br />Col. Davis now brings this Complaint for violation of his First and Fifth Amendment rights, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, including reinstatement to his Assistant Director position, and damages.<br /></blockquote><br />The ACLU sent a letter to the Library of Congress in December seeking the reinstatement of Davis. The Library denied the request.<br /><br />In October 2007, Davis <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that he was pressured to use classified evidence against defendants. He claimed that the push to use classified evidence stemmed from certain military officials&#39; desire to keep the trials closed. This issue played a role in his <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/top-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] earlier in October 2007. Davis complained that the officer who served as legal adviser should not have been supervising his work.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran&#39;s Prosecutor-General <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/vevak.htm">Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei</a> [GlobalSecurity profile] on Monday called for sedition trials against leaders of protests following last June&#39;s contested <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60A2HB20100111">statement to Tehran prosecutors</a> [Reuters report], Ejei said that he supported calls by religious and civil authorities to try those who led anti-government protests for &quot;mohareb,&quot;or warring against God, which is punishable by execution. In a <a href="http://sahamnews.org/?p=226">letter</a> [text, in Persian] addressed to the Iranian people, opposition leader <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html">Mehdi Karroubi</a> [NYT profile] said that he would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hBY1xXI4NRl3HMVShe9CYxvEljGQ">not be deterred</a> [AFP report] from continuing to push for reform by threats of prosecution. On Sunday, an Iranian parliamentary committee <a href="http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=1014552">released</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Mehr</span> report] the results of an investigation into claims by Karroubi that those arrested during the protests were subject to sexual abuse while in custody. Although the committee found no convincing evidence of sexual abuse, it did fault former Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi for sending detainees to Kahrizak prison, where they were subject to beatings, cramped conditions, and ill treatment that resulted in the deaths of at least three detainees.<br /><br />The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years. In September, human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of rights violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">beatings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-forcing-confessions-from-political.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_01-11-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/132-orig.pdf">Alabama v. North Carolina</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on an interstate dispute over the disposal of radioactive waste. The dispute centers on an agreement, entered into by eight southern states in 1986, for the disposal of the region&#39;s low-level radioactive waste. Under the agreement, North Carolina was selected to construct a facility for waste disposal and received financial assistance to that end. However, North Carolina did not obtain a license for the facility and subsequently withdrew from the compact. The four remaining states that are still parties to the agreement brought suit against North Carolina in the Supreme Court seeking enforcement of monetary sanctions. The Court has original jurisdiction over the dispute and agreed to hear the suit in 2003. Both parties were arguing Monday for exceptions to the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/SpecMastRpt/Orig132_prelim.pdf">reports of the special master</a> [preliminary report, PDF; <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/SpecMastRpt/Orig132_second.pdf">second report</a>, PDF]. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that, contrary to the special master&#39;s reports, they should be entitled to summary judgment:<blockquote>North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by the commission or whether you evaluate it from the perspective of the repeated statements by the executives of the commission that there had been a material breach and a repudiation, or whether you examine it from the perspective of the undisputed record that was collected by the special master, the conclusion it seems to me is inescapable that what North Carolina did here by taking no action between December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not fulfill the responsibilities that they had, that North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only issue should be what is the appropriate remedy for this extraordinary breach?</blockquote>Counsel for North Carolina argued that the compact is &quot;based on a consensual model, where it - each - each state can withdraw and therefore the compact has to be in the rough financial interest of each of the States at any point in time.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-11191.pdf">Briscoe v. Virginia</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-adds-confrontation-clause.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether a state violates the Confrontation Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag1_user.html#amdt6_hd4">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] by allowing a prosecutor to introduce a certificate of a forensic laboratory analysis without presenting the testimony of the analyst who prepared the certificate. The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that there was no Confrontation Clause violation because the accused has a right to call the analyst as his own witness. Just last term, the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-591.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/forensic-lab-reports-are-testimonial.php">report</a>] 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-591">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-sentencing-gun-law.php">report</a>] that a forensic analyst&#39;s laboratory report is testimonial evidence under the Confrontation Clause, giving criminal defendants a right to cross-examine the analysts. Counsel for the petitioners urged the Court not to reverse that decision:<blockquote>We ask the Court in this case to take no new ground beyond that established just last term in the Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are high. If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and hold that a State may impose on the defendant the burden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand, it would severely impair the confrontation right and threaten a fundamental transformation in the way Anglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds of years.</blockquote>Counsel for the state of Virginia argued that the defendants&#39; rights are adequately protected if the defendant is able to call the witness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Danish prosecutors on Monday brought an additional charge of terrorism against the Somali man already charged with the attempted murders of Kurt Westergaard, illustrator of the controversial 2005 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4688602.stm">cartoon depicting Prophet Muhammad</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon">news archive</a>] as a suicide bomber, and a police officer. The man, who remains unnamed, is said to have broken into Westergaard&#39;s home with an axe and a knife, in what is believed to be an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60A2CI20100111">assassination attempt</a> [Reuters report]. Police on the scene shot and wounded the man and arrested him after he threw the axe, narrowly missing an officer. Westergaard remained unharmed. Denmark&#39;s police intelligence suggest the attempted murder was terror-related and claim the man has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6973966.ece">ties</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report] to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] and the Somali militant group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18650/">Al-Shabaab</a> [CFR backgrounder]. Danish law permits certain crimes carried out with the intent of terrorism to carry a penalty of life in prison. The terrorism charge is yet to be heard by a court. The man has denied the charges of attempted murder.<br /><br />Westergaard&#39;s 2005 picture of the Muhammad was one of a series of caricatures published by a Danish newspaper that infuriated Muslims around the world. Many Muslims consider depictions of Muhammad offensive, and when other newspapers reprinted the caricatures in 2006 it triggered violence in several countries, leading to multiple <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muhammad-cartoons-furor-kills-15-in.php">deaths</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muslim-cartoon-protestors-burn-danish.php">burning of Danish embassy buildings</a> [JURIST reports], and boycotts of Danish goods. In 2006, a Danish court <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/danish-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit filed by Muslim organizations against the two editors of the Danish newspaper that published caricatures of  Muhammad. The plaintiffs sued Editor-in-Chief Carsten Juste and Culture Editor Flemming Rose for defamation and sought more than $16,000 in damages. The City Court in Aerhus held that while some Muslims may have been offended by the cartoons, there was no reason to believe the editors intended to &quot;belittle Muslims.&quot;

In a <span style="font-style:italic;">per curiam</span> opinion, the Court found that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erred when it <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/05/05/0715592.pdf">allowed consideration</a> [opinion, PDF] of a report detailing <a href="http://buchanan.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/the-prosecutors-fallacy/#more-13">statistical errors</a> [NYT backgrounder] in DNA evidence against the defendant submitted 11 years after the trial as part of a <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petition under the sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard announced in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/443/307/case.html">Jackson v.

Given the persuasiveness of such evidence in the eyes of the jury, it is important that it be presented in a fair and reliable manner. The State acknowledges that [the prosecution witness] committed the prosecutor&#39;s fallacy ... and the Mueller Report suggests that [the witness&#39;s] testimony may have been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match with one of respondent&#39;s brothers. Regardless, ample DNA and non-DNA evidence in the record adduced at trial supported the jury&#39;s guilty verdict under <span style="font-style:italic;">Jackson</span>[.]<br /></blockquote><br />The Court noted that even if the Court of Appeals were permitted to consider the post-conviction report, it committed an &quot;egregious&quot; error by excluding all DNA evidence from sufficiency consideration.<br /><br />Addressing the issue of post-conviction use of DNA evidence last June, the Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-finds-no-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-6">District Attorney&#39;s Office v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Police in the southern Italian town of Rosarno began evacuating hundreds of African immigrants Saturday, following three days of violence that began Thursday when a group of immigrants was attacked while returning from the farms where they worked. The attack sparked <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/world/europe/11italy.html">rioting</a> [NYT report] among the immigrant population and resulted in property damage as well as injuries to more than 50 immigrants and police officers. The evacuated immigrants were sent to detention centers around Italy and face deportation if they <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60906D">lack regular residence permits</a> [Reuters report]. Italian <a href="http://www.interno.it/mininterno/site/it/sezioni/ministero/ministro/">Interior Minister Roberto Maroni</a> [official profile, in Italian] praised the police response in returning order to the area. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/italy">International Organization for Migration in Italy</a> [advocacy website] indicated that the events had pulled the issue of illegal immigration into the forefront.<br /><br />Illegal immigration is a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7564584.stm">growing problem</a> [BBC report] in Italy, where about 36,000 illegal immigrants arrived by boat in 2008. In July, Italy&#39;s Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/italy-senate-passes-anti-illegal.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] making illegal immigration a crime. Italy&#39;s Chamber of Deputies <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/italy-lower-house-approves-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in May. The law has been opposed by both the Catholic Church and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website]. In November 2008, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-rights-experts-concerned-about-italy.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] about Italy&#39;s treatment of migrants and asylum seekers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A naturalized American citizen pleaded not guilty on Saturday in federal court in New York City to charges of conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country and of receiving military training from al Qaeda. Adis Mendunjanin was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/nyregion/10plot.html">indicted</a> [NYT report] in the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/index.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] on Saturday morning, and his lawyer has accused authorities of holding and questioning his client without access to his family or his lawyer for 36 hours. Medunjanin remains in detention, and prosecutors have announced that they intend to seek a permanent order of detention at a bail hearing that has been set for next Thursday. Medunjanin was <a href="http://newyork.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel10/nyfo010810.htm">arrested</a> [press release] on Friday morning in connection with an ongoing investigation related to Najibullah Zazi, the suspected terrorist accused last September of conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction. Zarein Ahmedzay was also arrested Friday in connection with the Zazi investigation. All three men allegedly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60729D20100110">traveled together</a> [Reuters report] to Pakistan in 2008 to receive al Qaeda training, according to prosecutors.<br /><br />Zazi is a native of Afghanistan who was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8265201.stm">arrested</a> [BBC report] by FBI agents in Colorado last fall. He was originally charged with making false statements to the FBI. Zazi was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/zazi-indictment.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-announces-indictment-of-suspected.php">report</a>] with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. Zazi <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in September. At the time, prosecutors from the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <font style="text-decoration: underline;"></font> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-zazi-terror30-2009sep30,0,5008522.story">said</a> [LAT report] that they had significant information to use against Zazi, while his lawyer countered that the prosecution cannot prove Zazi&#39;s guilt unless they identify the other conspirators.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military judge ruled Monday that the trials for two <a href="http://www.sealchallenge.navy.mil/seal/">Navy SEALs</a> [official website] accused in the alleged assault of an Iraqi prisoner will be held on a US military base in Iraq in order for the alleged victim to be questioned in court. Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe and Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas are accused of assisting in a cover-up of the alleged assault of Ahmed Hashim Abed after his capture in September. A third SEAL, Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, is accused of assaulting Abed after his capture as well as assisting in the cover-up of the assault. Abed is suspected of organizing the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3585765.stm">2004 ambush and killing of four US contractors in Fallujah</a> [BBC report]. A hearing has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jOa3BL-iW80EIEwuZgB2j91csT9g">tentatively been scheduled</a> [CP report] for Wednesday to determine if McCabe&#39;s trial should also be moved to Iraq. Keene and Huertas will face trial in April, while a trial date has not yet been set for McCabe. All three men have pleaded not guilty to the charges. <br /><br />Detainee abuse has been a major issue during the occupation of Iraq. In September 2008, the UK Defense Ministry admitted that <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/uk-defence-ministry-admits-liability.php">soldiers unlawfully abused</a> [JURIST report] detainees. In August of that year, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-navy-guards-charged-with-abusing.php">six US sailors were charged</a> [JURIST report] with allegedly abusing detainees at the <a href="http://www.worldlingo.com/ma/enwiki/en/Camp_Bucca">Camp Bucca</a> [backgrounder] prison facility in Southern Iraq. Abuse of detainees during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Iraq+War">Iraq War</a> [JURIST news archive] first garnered international attention after the 2004 release of pictures depicting prisoner abuse at <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/badapples/history.html">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [CBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">news archive</a>] in Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska ruled on Tuesday that Basque separatist group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">ETA</a> [JURIST news archive] had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed. Grande-Marlaska <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/intento/derribar/veces/avion/Aznar/misil/funciono/elpepiesp/20100113elpepinac_1/Tes">detailed the three assassination attempts</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] as part of a description of the alleged crimes of ETA leader Pedro Maria Olano Zabala, who was arrested in the Basque region last Thursday. The group had allegedly tried three times to use a rocket launcher to fire a missile at Aznar&#39;s plane in retribution for Aznar&#39;s <a href="http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=232196">refusal to accept a compromise with the group</a> [ABC report, in Spanish], but the launcher failed three times and was <a href="http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php?/news/comments/eta_planned_to_shoot_down_plane_with_former_spanish_premier_onboard/1201101003pm">finally sent to ETA operatives in France for repair</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Barcelona Reporter</span> report]. Rocket launchers belonging to ETA have been seized in France. <br /><br />In September, accused ETA leader Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/accused-basque-separatist-leader.php">refused to make any statement</a> [JURIST report] during hearings before the Spanish National Court. In June, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-spain-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Spain&#39;s ban of Basque political groups <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>] and Herri Batasuna for their alleged ties to ETA. In April, alleged ETA leader <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Tallado/kale/borroka/elpepunac/20090419elpepinac_14/Tes">Jurdan Martitegi Lizaso</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</font> backgrounder, in Spanish] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/france-police-arrest-alleged-basque.php">arrested</a> in France, and a Spanish judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-court-charges-basque-leader-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] him with murder for a May 2008 car bombing that killed a Spanish policeman.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US military referred charges Monday against Army Capt. Carl Bjork, accused by several Iraqi detainees of ordering the killings of two Iraqi civilians in 2006. The charges against Bjork include one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of premeditated murder. The accusers are three Iraqi police officers and a former Iraqi Intel officer currently being detained in Iraq. Bjork&#39;s attorney Victor Kelly, who practices with the <a href="http://www.nmjg.com/">National Military Justice Group</a> [organization website], has said that the <a href="http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=130620&catid=339">case against his client is weak</a> [9News report]. Bjork&#39;s case is set to go before a court-martial in Baghdad before March 1.<br /><br />Detainee and civilian abuse has been a major issue during the occupation of Iraq. Earlier this week, a US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/navy-seals-accused-of-assaulting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the trials for two <a href="http://www.sealchallenge.navy.mil/seal/">Navy SEALs</a> [official website] accused in the alleged assault of an Iraqi prisoner will be held on a US military base in Iraq in order for the alleged victim to be questioned in court. Last week, US security firm <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] reached a settlement agreement in seven federal lawsuits filed by Iraqi citizens. The suits claimed that Blackwater, now known as Xe, created a reckless culture that resulted in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST reports] in September 2007 and the 2006 killing of an Iraqi guard. The settlement was reached after a US judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissed charges</a> [JURIST report] against five guards indicted for their involvement in the 2007 killings. Last year, the US <a href="http://www.army.mil/">Army</a> [official website] court-martialed soldiers from the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th infantry</a> [unit website] for their alleged roles in the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/second-us-soldier-to-face-court-martial.php">2007 killings of four Iraqi citizens</a> [JURIST report]. The crime was an alleged retributive act for casualties suffered by the unit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] One month after hackers attempted to access Chinese human rights activists&#39; e-mail accounts through the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website] Gmail service, the company <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html">announced</a> [press release] on Tuesday that it would rethink its involvement in the Internet market in China, possibly pulling out of the country. Among the possible changes in policy being considered are a cessation of search result censoring. Google indicated that it would work with the Chinese government to find a way to allow an, &quot;unfiltered search engine within the law as well,&quot; but also noted that if an agreement cannot be reached, it may close its offices there and shut down its Google.cn website. Human rights groups applauded Google&#39;s announcement, with <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/12/china-google-challenges-censorship">calling the move</a> [press release] &quot;unprecedented.&quot;<br /><br />The attack on activists&#39; accounts is the latest in a long string of purported human rights abuses in China. Last month, China was criticized for <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-executes-british-national-for.php">executing a British national</a> [JURIST report] for drug smuggling, after refusing to conduct an investigation into the man&#39;s mental health. Also in December, human rights activist Liu Xiabo was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-rights-activist-sentenced-to-11.php">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> on subversion charges, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-rights-activist-tried-for.php">following a two-hour trial</a> [JURIST reports] that was closed to outsiders. In November, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/rights-group-accuses-china-of-illegal.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that accused China of holding citizens in &quot;black jails,&quot; where they were subject to numerous human rights abuses.

In order to protect their identities, the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/press/en/PR1340e.pdf">chamber will examine</a> [press release, PDF] the remaining witnesses behind closed doors. Seselj, leader of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), is on trial in the ICTY, <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-remdamdi070329.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes. He is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.<br /><br />In July, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Seselj of contempt and sentenced him to 15 months in prison for authoring a book revealing pertinent information about several key witnesses. Seselj was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/icty-charges-seselj-with-contempt-for.php">charged with contempt</a> [JURIST report] last January. The ICTY had previously <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/serb-nationalist-war-crimes-defendant_27.php">stripped Seselj of his right to defend himself</a> after he failed to appear in court, despite an earlier appeals court ruling that he could <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/icty-appeals-panel-rules-serb.php">represent himself</a> [JURIST reports] provided he did not engage in courtroom behavior that &quot;substantially obstruct[ed] the proper and expeditious proceedings in his case.&quot;

Maine Public Utilities</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">report</a>] that the <u>Mobile-Sierra</u> doctrine applies when an entity not party to an interstate electricity contract contests the contract as not being &quot;just and reasonable&quot; as required by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode16/usc_sec_16_00000824---e000-.html">Section 206 of the Federal Power Act</a> [text]. Under the <u>Mobile-Sierra</u> doctrine, the <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC) [official website] must presume a wholesale rate contract is &quot;just and reasonable,&quot; and that presumption can be overcome only by showing that the contract &quot;seriously harms the public interest.&quot; The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200803/06-1403-1108079.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <u>Mobile-Sierra</u> doctrine does not apply when challenged by an entity not party to the contract. In reversing the appeals court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg relied on the Court&#39;s 2008 decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-1457.ZO.html">Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>]:<br /><blockquote><br />We reverse the D. C. Circuit&#39;s judgment to the extent that it rejects the application of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mobile-Sierra</span> to noncontracting parties. Our decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Morgan Stanley</span>, announced three months after the D. C. Circuit&#39;s disposition, made clear that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mobile-Sierra</span> public interest standard is not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable standard; it is an application of that standard in the context of rates set by contract. The &quot;venerable <span style="font-style:italic;">Mobile-Sierra</span> doctrine&quot; rests on &quot;the stabilizing force of contracts.&quot; To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC itself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting as well as contracting parties.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, rejecting the Court&#39;s holding in <u>Morgan Stanley</u>, from which he dissented, and its extension to this case.<br /><br />The dispute arose over problems with New England&#39;s energy grid. In 2006, FERC approved a settlement agreement, which established rate-setting mechanisms. A number of parties that were not involved in the contract but opposed the settlement agreement petitioned for review in the DC Circuit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] filed <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21377.pdf">new charges</a> [complaint, PDF] Tuesday against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website], alleging that the company <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21377.htm">failure to disclose</a> [press release] to its shareholders &quot;extraordinary losses&quot; at <a href="http://www.ml.com">Merrill Lynch</a> [corporate website] prior to the merger of the two companies. The SEC&#39;s complaint charges BOA with violating Section 14(a) of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec14.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule14a-9.html">SEC Rule 14a-9</a> [texts], which require disclosure &quot;necessary or appropriate ... for the protection of investors.&quot; BOA shareholders voted to approve the proposed merger with Merrill Lynch at a meeting in December 2008. The SEC alleges that BOA learned that Merrill Lynch had incurred billions of dollars in losses for October and November before the vote, but failed to disclose the losses to shareholders. Merrill Lynch&#39;s full fourth quarter 2008 losses, totaling more than $15 billion, were announced more than a month later, in January 2009. BOA stock dropped nearly 30 percent the next day, according to the SEC.  <br /><br />The SEC originally sought to add this charge to its previous case against BOA, which charged it with <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/sec-charges-bank-of-america-with.php">misleading investors</a> [JURIST report] regarding billions of dollars paid to Merrill Lynch executives during the acquisition of the firm. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-rejects-sec-bank-of.php">twice rejected a proposed settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the SEC and BOA for $33 million, which did not admit any fault or directly penalize any corporate executives, calling the settlement unfair to the shareholders.  The original complaint, filed in August, alleges that during the merger of the companies, BOA allowed Merrill Lynch to pay more than $3.6 billion in bonuses to its executives, despite record losses at that time, and withheld such information from its shareholders.

Judge William Alexander of the <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/franklin/home.html">Franklin County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/232827">ruled</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Roanoke Times</span> Report] that the defendants, university President <a href="http://www.president.vt.edu/steger_bio.html">Charles Steger</a> [university profile], Executive Vice President James Hyatt, and employees of the university&#39;s <a href="http://www.ucc.vt.edu/">Cook Counseling Center</a> [center website], are not immune from suit. Claims against the other defendants named in the lawsuit, including the <a href="http://www.nrvcs.org/">New River Community Services Board</a> [website], top university administrators, and the university itself, were dismissed. Alexander&#39;s ruling permits the suits to move forward with pre-trial discovery and possibly a trial. <br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/families-of-virginia-tech-shooting.php">suit was filed</a> [JURIST report] in April by the parents of <a href="http://www.vt.edu/remember/biographies/julia_kathleen_pryde.html">Julie Pryde</a> and <a href="http://www.vt.edu/remember/biographies/erin_nicole_peterson.html">Erin Peterson</a> [Virginia Tech profiles], who were shot and killed by fellow student <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6564653.stm">Seung-Hoi Cho</a> [BBC profile]. In June 2008, a Virginia judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/judge-approves-11-million-virginia-tech.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an $11 million settlement with the families of 24 people who had been killed in the shooting. The settlement awarded each family $100,000 plus medical expenses and provides for meetings with Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and university and police officials. The Pryde and Peterson families did not participate in the settlement agreement. The Virginia Tech shooting left 33 people dead and wounded 25 in the deadliest school shooting in US history.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of three federal judges on Tuesday <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/33fd9c0607be66f188256d480060b74b/e5a3b5c9bfe0cfbb882576a9007fbd45/$FILE/order%20to%20reduce%20prison%20population.pdf">approved</a> [order, PDF] a revised <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/2009_Press_Releases/docs/11-12_Filed-Stamped_Filing.pdf">plan</a> [text, PDF] filed by the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) [official website] for reducing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+overcrowding">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The new plan includes revisions made possible because of legislative enactments, including summary parole for lower-level offenses to reduce the amount of inmates re-entering the prison system for parole violations and credit earning enhancements to reduce time served. Action on the order will be delayed because the <a href="http://www.gov.ca.gov/">Schwarzennger administration</a> [official website] has appealed the prison population reduction order to the US Supreme Court, which is expected to decide whether to take the case <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/01/12/state/n164358S20.DTL&type=politics">later this month</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> report].<br /><br />The CDCR <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/california-files-new-plan-to-reduce.php">filed the plan</a> in November after the panel rejected the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/california-inmate-reduction-plan-falls.php">first plan</a> because it did not comply with a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">order to reduce the prison population</a> [JURIST reports]. The original plan did not include the legislative enactments but provided various ways of reducing overcrowding, including transferring more prisoners to out-of-state prisons, GPS monitoring of inmates who violate parole, commuting sentences of inmates who are eligible for deportation, and building new facilities or converting unused space. In September, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/supreme-court-ruling-requires.php">refused to grant a request</a> [JURIST report] by the state of California to temporarily stay the court order to reduce the prison population, pending appeal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The 2003 US-British invasion of Iraq was a violation of international law and was not supported by UN resolutions, according to a <a href="http://download.onderzoekscommissie-irak.nl/rapport_commissie_irak.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in Dutch; <a href="http://www.onderzoekscommissie-irak.nl/Content/www.onderzoekscommissie-irak.nl/Documenten/press_release_conclusions_of_the_committee_of_inquiry_on_iraq.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] released Tuesday by a Dutch parliamentary inquiry. The Dutch Parliament began an investigation into the Iraq War in March by establishing the <a href="http://www.onderzoekscommissie-irak.nl/#pagina=920">Committee of Inquiry on Iraq</a> [official website], chaired by former president of the Supreme Court of Netherlands <a href="http://www.onderzoekscommissie-irak.nl/#pagina=1081">WJM Davids</a> [official profile]. According to the report, during the build-up to the war, newly-elected <a href="http://www.government.nl/Government/Balkenende_IV_Government/Jan_Peter_Balkenende">Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende</a>, being more concerned with domestic issues, played little or no role in the debates over the legitimacy of the Iraq invasion and left most of these decisions to then-minister of foreign affairs <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/who_is_who_7329.htm?">Jaap de Hoop Scheffer</a> [official profiles]. The committee found that the wording of <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/unscr1441.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 1441</a> [text], offering Iraq a final opportunity for disarmament, &quot;cannot reasonably be interpreted as authorizing individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council&#39;s resolutions,&quot; and therefore did not constitute a mandate for the invasion. According to the committee, the government was too concerned with its alliance with the US and Britain and gave insufficient importance to information provided by intelligence agencies and weapons inspection reports, which gave little or no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Balkenende has <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/balkenende-rejects-iraq-enquiry-criticism">rejected</a> [RNW report] the report&#39;s criticism.<br /><br />Former UK prime minister <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/blair.php">news archive</a>] is also facing criticism over the legality of the Iraq War. According to a letter leaked to the British <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/">Iraq Inquiry</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7312757.stm">backgrounder</a>], confirmed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Mail</span> in November, former UK attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4379225.stm">Peter Goldsmith</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-uk-pm-blair-was-warned-iraq.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Blair that the planned invasion of Iraq could be illegal. The July 2002 letter laid out the reasons that Goldsmith believed the Iraq invasion might be illegal, including that an invasion could not be based on &quot;regime change&quot; alone. The existence of this letter will increase the difficulty for Blair to use a good-faith defense against charges that he knowingly led the country into an illegal invasion. He and Goldsmith are likely to be witnesses for the inquiry in the near future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A member of the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/350909">&quot;Toronto 18&quot;</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> backgrounder; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Toronto+18">JURIST news archive</a>] pleaded not guilty in a Canadian court on Monday for his alleged role in a failed 2006 terrorist plot to bomb the Toronto Stock Exchange and government buildings. Shareef Abdelhaleem, the first adult of the group to be tried, allegedly planned to <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crime/article/749522---toronto-18-trial-three-men-a-table-and-dreams-of-gold">profit from the attacks</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> report] by investing in and selling particular stock before the bombings. A key witness in the case, Shaher Elsoheny, left a <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) [official website] witness protection program to testify against his old classmate, Abdelhaleem. Elsoheny worked as a police informant and <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=2430433"> provided intelligence</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">National Post</span> report] against Abdelhaleem and others that eventually led to the arrests. Abdelhaleem&#39;s lawyer argued that his client was entrapped by Elsoheny, who was allegedly <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto-bomb-plot-suspect-accused-of-seeking-to-cash-in-on-chaos/article1426400/">paid millions of dollars</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report] by the RCMP for his assistance in the investigation.<br /><br />The accused leader of the terrorist group, Zakaria Amara, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/accused-toronto-18-leader-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in October to charges of planning to bomb three targets in Ontario. The same month, another member of the group, Ali Mohamed Dirie, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his part in the plot, while another, Saad Gaya, pleaded guilty. In September, the first of the group to plead guilty, Saad Khalid, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">14 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], though the Canadian government is seeking to alter that sentence for time already served. The first of the suspects to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/canada-convicts-first-defendant-under.php">convicted under Canada&#39;s post-9/11 terrorism law</a> was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/canada-court-sentences-and-releases.php">sentenced and released</a> [JURIST reports] in May, with the court citing time served. The &quot;Toronto 18,&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/canada-police-arrest-17-suspected-of.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, are accused of planning a series of violent attacks on civilians, public officials, and government buildings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Tuesday denied the request by former <a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest Communications</a> [corporate website] CEO <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nacchio">Joseph Nacchio</a> [JURIST news archive] for a new trial on insider trading charges. Nacchio had requested a new trial on the basis that the company&#39;s CFO, a key witness in the trial, had changed her testimony, but Judge Marcia  Krieger of the <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Home.aspx">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1218673720100113?type=marketsNews">found</a> [Reuters report] that the change in testimony was not substantial enough to alter the conviction. Nacchio was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/former-qwest-ceo-convicted-of-insider.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 on 19 counts of insider trading for selling $52 million worth of stock in 2001 with knowledge that Qwest could miss its sales targets.  <br /><br />In October, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-declines-to-review-ex.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] Nacchio&#39;s conviction without comment, ending his lengthy appeals process, which stretched over two years. In August, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/tenth-circuit-rules-ex-qwest-ceo.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Nacchio was incorrectly sentenced and remanded the case for resentencing. In April, Nacchio <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/ex-qwest-ceo-nacchio-begins-serving.php">reported to the minimum security prison camp</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/sch/index.jsp">FCI Schuylkill</a> [official website]. Nacchio was initially <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/former-qwest-ceo-charged-with-42.php">indicted on 42 counts</a> [JURIST report] in 2005. He and other former Qwest executives still face <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/corporations-and-securities-brief-sec_15.php">civil fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] brought by the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website] on allegations that Qwest improperly reported approximately $3 billion in revenue that eased its 2000 merger with US West.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=gillan&sessionid=42675813&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=4&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=42722368&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] Tuesday that searches performed by police without legitimate suspicion are illegal. The ECHR found that British police had violated Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] when they stopped and searched two individuals in 2003 under the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_1">Terrorism Act 2000</a> [text]. Under Article 8, everyone is entitled to the right of respect for private and family life. The court found:<br /><blockquote><br />[T]he use of the coercive powers conferred by the legislation to require an individual to submit to a detailed search of his person, his clothing and his personal belongings amounts to a clear interference with the right to respect for private life. Although the search is undertaken in a public place, this does not mean that Article 8 is inapplicable. Indeed, in the Court&#39;s view, the public nature of the search may, in certain cases, compound the seriousness of the interference because of an element of humiliation and embarrassment. Items such as bags, wallets, notebooks and diaries may, moreover, contain personal information which the owner may feel uncomfortable about having exposed to the view of his companions or the wider public.<br /></blockquote><br />UK Home Secretary <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/organisation/ministers1/alan-johnson/">Alan Johnson</a> [official profile] plans to appeal the decision. As a result, the <a href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/default.asp">Association of Chief Police Officers</a> (ACPO) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/pressrelease.asp?PR_GUID={5B35254F-BA63-402E-90B8-AB195B2216BF}">statement</a> [press release] saying that they will continue to use the tactics to protect the public.<br /><br />The ruling is a blow to the UK&#39;s effort to enhance their counter-terrorism efforts, which have recently come under criticism. Last month, the British House of Commons <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/home_affairs_committee.cfm">Home Affairs Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-traveler-data-program-may-violate-eu.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the UK&#39;s 1.2 billion-pound <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/technology/eborders/">e-Borders</a> [official website] program would likely be found illegal under EU law. The program was intended to provide the <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/">UK Border Agency</a> (UKBA) [official website] with a more effective and efficient security system by collecting and analyzing information on all passengers entering or leaving the UK. In September, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-government-frees-second-terrorism.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a second terrorism suspect from a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+control+order">control order</a> [JURIST news archive] that subjected him to virtual house arrest because it did not want to reveal secret evidence. The UK Law Lords <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-top-court-limits-control-orders.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in a series of decisions in 2008 that the government could continue to impose control orders on terror suspects in lieu of detention, but said that some elements of the orders violate human rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_01-12-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Tuesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1224.pdf">United States v. Comstock</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-to-hear-sex-offender.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether Congress had the authority to enact certain provisions of the  <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00004248----000-.html">Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 4248 text], which allow a person deemed &quot;sexually dangerous&quot; to be civilly committed after the expiration of a federal criminal sentence. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/077671.P.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fourth-circuit-finds-federal-civil.php">report</a>] that the law was beyond Congress&#39; authority under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/">Solicitor General Elena Kagan</a> [official profile] defended the law, arguing:<blockquote>What Congress said here was something pretty simple and very reasonable. It said if we, the Federal Government, have somebody in our custody, and we know that that person has the kind of mental illness that is going to cause grave danger to the community; and we know that there is no one else who is in a good position to prevent it; and we know that we were in part responsible for that vacuum, then we should be able to do something about it. That&#39;s what section 4248 says, and section 4248 is constitutional for that reason.</blockquote>Some of the justices seemed skeptical of Kagan&#39;s position, with Justice Antonin Scalia calling the law &quot;a recipe for the federal government taking over everything.&quot; Counsel for the respondents distinguished sex offenders from people found not guilty by reason of insanity. Last week, a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-civil-commitment-constitutional.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the law, finding that civil commitments were within the power granted to Congress under the Constitution&#39;s Necessary and Proper Clause as an extension of the government&#39;s custodial responsibility for federal inmates. <br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-645.pdf">Abbott v. Abbott</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-international-child.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether a <span style="font-style:italic;">ne exeat</span> clause, which prohibits one parent from removing a child from the country without the other parent&#39;s consent, confers a &quot;right of custody&quot; within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on International Child Abduction</a> [text]. The Hague Convention requires a country to return a child who has been &quot;wrongfully removed&quot; from his country of habitual residence. Under Art. 12, a &quot;wrongful removal&quot; is one that occurs &quot;in breach of rights of custody.&quot; The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-50967-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <span style="font-style:italic;">ne exeat</span> rights do not constitute &quot;rights of custody&quot; within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The Hague Convention exists to ensure that custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the country of habitual residence rather than through abduction. It thus generally requires the return of a child who is abducted in violation of a right of custody. So too, a ne exeat right permits a parent to require that the child reside in the country of habitual residence, thereby rendering international abduction illegal.<br /><br />Ne exeat rights are not only rights of custody under the text of the convention, but they also track the convention&#39;s vital purpose of ensuring that children are not subject to international abduction.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent distinguished rights of custody from rights of access.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Taiwanese court said Monday that former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chen+Shui-bian">news archive</a>] will be tried Friday in closed-door proceedings. The High Court said that proceedings, set for 9:30 AM Friday, would be <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/11/content_12792247.htm">closed to the media</a> [Xinhua report] under secrecy regulations. Chen was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in September on corruption charges relating to funds he received while traveling abroad as president. He is accused of embezzling USD $330,000. Chen has maintained his innocence, claiming that current Taiwanese <a href="http://www.president.gov.tw/en/">President Ma Ying-jeou</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Ma+Ying-jeou">news archive</a>] is using Chen&#39;s trial to distance himself from Chen&#39;s anti-China views.<br /><br />Chen, who served as president of Taiwan from 2000-2008, and his wife have been <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">serving life sentences</a> [JURIST report] since September, when they were found guilty of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering. Taiwan&#39;s <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/taiwan-high-court-dismisses-ex.php">dismissed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in October, in which Chen claimed that his constitutional rights were violated when judges were replaced during the proceedings against him. Last month, Chen, along with his wife and 20 other family members and prominent business leaders, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] on additional charges of corruption and money laundering in relation to Chen&#39;s financial reform program. Chen and his wife are accused of taking bribes from banks and financial institutions that sought to protect themselves during the reform.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UK court on Tuesday began the first non-jury criminal trial in England or Wales in more than 400 years. Defendants John Twomey, Peter Blake, Barry Hibberd, and Glen Cameron appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice, accused of armed robbery of &pound;1.75m from the Menzies World Cargo Warehouse at Heathrow Airport in 2004. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/uk-to-hold-first-judge-only-criminal.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] to conduct the trial without a jury was made in June by Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge. The ruling was the first application of a <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_1">Criminal Justice Act 2003</a> [text] provision, which allows a court to hold a judge-only trial if there is &quot;evidence of a real and present danger&quot; that jury tampering may take place and it is determined that other measures to prevent tampering would be ineffective. Explaining his decision, Judge cited concerns about the expense of maintaining security for jurors and noted there have already been three aborted attempts to conduct this trial.<br /><br />Some civil liberties groups have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8454102.stm">expressed concern</a> [BBC report] that conducting a trial without a jury undermines a fundamental principle of justice. Analysts question if one judge can be as objective as 12 jurors, and also wonder if this move casts doubt on the court system&#39;s ability to provide security for jurors in general. The law allowing for judge-only trials in both cases of jury tampering and fraud was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2008/dec/16/criminal-justice-act">passed</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> backgrounder] in 2003 and came into effect in 2007. It had earlier been <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/uk-house-of-lords-defeats-bill-curbing.htm">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by the House of Lords before undergoing revisions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January10/museabduwaliabdukhadirs1indictmentpr.pdf">filed a superseding indictment</a> [press release, PDF] Tuesday against alleged Somali pirate Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, claiming that he led the takeover of two additional ships. Muse pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website]. The 10-count indictment does not provide the identity of the ships involved in the alleged hijackings or details about the events, but prosecutors <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/nyregion/13pirate.html">stated</a> [NYT report] that hostages from one of the ships remain in captivity. Muse, who was captured by US forces following an attempted attack on the container ship <a href="http://media.maersk.com/en/PressReleases/2009/Pages/APMM080409.aspx">Maersk Alabama</a> [corporate backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/federal-court-to-try-somali-piracy.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with five counts in April, including committing an act of piracy as defined by the law of nations, conspiracy to seize a ship by force, conspiracy to take hostages, and two counts relating to the use of a firearm during commission of a crime. The government believes that Muse coordinated the attack in the original indictment and presented himself as the leader of the gang. Despite difficulty in determining Muse&#39;s exact age, the SDNY has decided to try Muse as an adult. <br /><br />In July, the <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27&Itemid=16">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/maritime-piracy-has-doubled-in-first.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that pirate attacks around the globe doubled in the first half of 2009. The bulk of the upsurge came from increased activity in the Gulf of Aden and Somali coastal waters, where 130 incidents occurred since January. In May, five suspected Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/somali-pirate-suspects-go-on-trial-in.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in Holland, accused of attempting to hijack a Dutch Antilles freighter in the Gulf of Aden. Earlier in 2009, a US Coast Guard chief <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-coast-guard-chief-calls-for.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the enforcement of international piracy laws, citing the importance of entering Somali waters to combat the problem.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ahmed_khalfan_ghailani.htm">Ahmed Ghailani</a> [GlobalSecurity profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ghailani">news archive</a>] argued Monday that the charges against their client should be dismissed. Ghailani&#39;s lawyers argued before Judge Louis Kaplan of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] that he was denied the right to a speedy trial while being detained for nearly five years in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] secret prisons and later at Guantanamo Bay. The prosecution countered that the delay was reasonable, as Ghailani was held as an intelligence asset, and his interrogation did not violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial. According to the defense&#39;s November <a href="/pdf/ghailanispeedytrialmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-seek.php">report</a>], national security concerns should never &quot;trump a defendant&#39;s Constitutional right to a Speedy Trial.&quot; The prosecution argued in its December <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/24357966/Ghailani-Case-Govt-s-Motion-to-Dismiss">response</a> [text] that, &quot;[t]he Government had unusual but highly compelling reasons for its treatment of the defendant, which had the effect of delaying his case. ... It is a case where the Government reasonably sought to defend the country from a profound and novel threat.&quot; <br /><br />Ghailani faces charges for his alleged involvement in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombings of US embassies</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=embassy+kenya+tanzania">news archive</a>] in Tanzania and Kenya, which killed 224 people. In November, a federal judge <a href="http://www.nylj.com/nylawyer/adgifs/decisions/111909kaplan.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Ghailani does <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-against-military.php">not have a right to be represented by his military defense lawyers</a> [JURIST report] in a civilian court. In July, Ghailani&#39;s military lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-request.php">requested access</a> [JURIST report] to the CIA &quot;black sites&quot; at which their client was held prior to his transfer to Guantanamo Bay and was allegedly subjected to cruel interrogation methods. Ghailani was the first Guantanamo detainee to be brought to the US for prosecution. Having been held at the Guantanamo facility since 2006, Ghailani was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to-us.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the SDNY in June to face 286 separate counts, including involvement in the bombings and conspiring with Osama bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda to kill Americans worldwide. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-ex-detainee-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] at his initial appearance.

Spisak</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">report</a>] that the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit contravened the directives of the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [text, PDF] by extending <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/486/367/case.html">Mills v. Maryland</a> [opinion text] to resolve in a <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petitioner&#39;s favor questions that were not decided or addressed in <u>Mills</u>. The Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/06a0388p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the jury instructions in defendant John Spisak, Jr&#39;s trial violated <u>Mills</u> by requiring unanimity in the finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. In reversing the decision below, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instructions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instructions, taken together with the forms, &quot;require[d]&quot; juror &quot;unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor&quot; - contrary to this Court&#39;s holding in Mills v. Maryland. Since the parties do not dispute that the Ohio courts &quot;adjudicated&quot; this claim, i.e., they considered and rejected it &quot;on the merits,&quot; the law permits a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the state-court decision &quot;was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.&quot; Unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Spisak&#39;s claim does not satisfy this standard.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice John Paul Stevens joined part of the opinion and filed a separate concurrence. Stevens would have found that the Appeals Court &quot;correctly concluded that two errors that occurred during Spisak&#39;s trial violated clearly established federal law,&quot; but agreed with the Court that the errors did not prejudice the defendant.<br /><br />In 1983, Spisak was convicted of three murders and two attempted murders, and he was sentenced to death. When the Ohio courts denied his appeals, he filed a petition for federal <em>habeas</em> relief. He argued both improper jury instructions and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

Among those sentenced was the group&#39;s alleged leader, Omar Nakhcha, who received the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hRnIRKbwFvWN9HvHIiwoY2fiCGoQ">strictest sentence</a> [AFP report, in Spanish].<br /><br />In all, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4899544.stm">28 co-defendants</a> [BBC profiles] were charged in Spain with 192 counts of murder and upwards of 1,800 counts of attempted murder related to the March 11, 2004 bombings, which killed 191 people and injured almost 2,000 more. Three defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/spain-court-issues-guilty-verdicts-in.php">convicted of murder</a> [JURIST report] and 18 others were found guilty of lesser charges. Last year, Spain&#39;s highest court of appeal said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/spain-court-facing-25-appeals-in-madrid.php">25 appeals had been filed</a> [JURIST report] against verdicts handed down against convicted participants for the bombings, both from defendants and from victims. The defendants have all protested their innocence and condemned the attacks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_01-13-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Wednesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-661.pdf">American Needle Inc. v. NFL</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-international-child.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/">National Football League</a> (NFL) [league website] and its member teams are a single entity that is exempt from rule of reason claims under Section 1 of the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a> [text]. The NFL teams reached an agreement with Reebok to license and sell consumer headwear and clothing with the respective teams&#39; logos and not to grant licenses to Reebok&#39;s competitors for 10 years. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=07-4006_017.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the NFL and its member teams are a single entity under the Sherman Act. Counsel for the petitioner, American Needle, cited the Court&#39;s 1984 decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/468/85/case.html">NCAA v. Board of Regents</a> [opinion text], arguing that:<blockquote>The 32 teams of the National Football League are separately owned and controlled profit-making enterprises. Under this Court&#39;s decision in NCAA, as well as the Court&#39;s more general joint venture jurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct agreements are, indeed, subject to Section 1 scrutiny.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is there is a longstanding consensus, judicial and legislative, that agreements among sports teams about whether and how they will participate in the marketplace is subject to scrutiny under the Sherman Act, Section 1.</blockquote>Counsel for the NFL argued that:<blockquote>There is no dispute that the NFL, including its licensing arm, NFL Properties, is a lawful venture. If venture formation is not an issue, then decisions by the venture about the venture&#39;s product are unilateral venture decisions, unilateral venture actions. They are not concerted actions of the -- of the venture&#39;s members.</blockquote>The Court appeared skeptical of the NFL&#39;s position, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggesting, &quot;you are seeking through this ruling what you haven&#39;t gotten from Congress: An absolute bar to an antitrust claim.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1200.pdf">Jerman v. Carlisle</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether a debt collector&#39;s legal error qualifies for the <span style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span> error defense under the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [15 USC &sect; 1692 text, PDF]. Petitioner Karen Jerman filed an action challenging the debt collection practices of the Carlisle law firm, claiming that they violated the FDCPA when they used allegedly deceptive forms to notify her of a foreclosure on her home. Specifically, Jerman claims that defendants violated the FDCPA by representing to Jerman that her debt would be assumed valid unless she disputed the debt &quot;in writing&quot; even though the FDCPA does not require a written dispute. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0299p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that although the defendants violated the FDCPA by instructing Jerman that she must dispute the debt in writing, defendants qualified for the FDCPA <span style="font-style:italic;">bona fide<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> error defense. Counsel for Jerman argued:<blockquote>Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is no exception to that rule. While it may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context, the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it prevents.<br /><br />And as a consequence, in light of that subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear. And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA indicates such an intent.</blockquote>Counsel for the US argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the petitioner. Counsel for the respondents argued that &quot;in a review of the text of this statute, all of the components may be read plainly to include the bona fide error defense, to include legal error.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK Parliament <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/justice.cfm">Justice Committee</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/94/9402.htm">reinvestment report</a> [text] on Thursday urging the prison populations in England and Wales to be reduced by a third. The committee found that incarceration is a relatively ineffective way of reducing crime except for serious offenders, and the amount of repeat offenders could be more efficiently reduced through rehabilitation programs such as housing, employment, education, and drug and alcohol services. The Ministry of Justice, which is currently spending &pound;4.2 billion on a new prison, claims that its current strategy of longer prison sentences, which incorporate rehabilitation services, is working and the number of repeat offenders has declined. According to the report, the new prison is a &quot;costly mistake&quot; and funds would be better allocated to local public services outside of the prisons.<br /><blockquote><br />We believe that that if reform, rehabilitation and reparation to victims were given higher priority, then sentencing and penal policy overall could make a much more significant contribution to reducing re-offending and making communities safer. We see risks that the direction of current policy will increase pressure on the prison estate, negating the valuable work on offender reform that does take place in prison, particularly for those in custody for over two years. It seems equally clear that, as matters stand, the probation service will also be overwhelmed by demand for resettlement services in relation to those coming out of prison, let alone the effective management of offenders in the community.<br /></blockquote><br />The committee admits that the implementation of their proposed strategy would be complex and challenging, but that it is necessary to reduce the UK&#39;s heavy burden of prison overcrowding and the reduction of repeat offenders.<br /><br />In 2007, the UK justice minister gave authority to prison governors to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/some-uk-inmates-set-for-early-release.php">release prisoners</a> [JURIST report] coming to the end of their sentences as a way to relieve <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prison+overcrowding">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] across England and Wales. Other countries are also facing a similar problem. In the US, a panel of three federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judges-approve-california-plan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a revised plan this week for reducing California&#39;s prison population. Earlier this week, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-law-allowing-house-arrest-to.php">Russian law</a> [JURIST report] allowing minor offenders to serve their sentences under house arrest rather than in prison entered into force. The bill is aimed at reducing the number of inmates in Russia&#39;s overcrowded prison system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] 2009 marked the worst year for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] in six years, according to a <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=385:2009-worldwide-piracy-figures-surpass-400&catid=60:news&Itemid=51">report</a> [press release] issued Thursday by the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website]. The total reported incidents of piracy reached 406, surpassing 400 for the first time since 2003. It is the third consecutive year that reports have increased rising from 239 reported incidents in 2006. According to the report, in 2009, there were 153 vessels boarded, 1052 crew members taken hostage, 49 vessels hijacked, 84 attempted attacks, and 120 vessels fired upon. Violence against crew has also increased with 68 injured and eight killed. The report showed that Somali pirates were responsible for more than half the reported incidents with 217 total. Piracy off the coast of Somalia continued early in 2010 when two ships were <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/02/somali-pirates-hijack-two_n_409324.html">captured</a> [AP report] on January 2 off the cost of Somalia: the British-flagged Asian Glory roughly 600 miles east of Somalia and the Singaporean-flagged chemical tanker the Pramoni, in the Gulf of Aden north of Somalia.<br /><br />Earlier this week, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-prosecutors-charge-suspected-somali.php">filed a superseding indictment</a> [JURIST report] against alleged Somali pirate Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, claiming that he led the takeover of two additional ships. Muse plead not guilty to the charges. In November, Somali judge Mohamed Abdi Aware, known for jailing suspected pirates, human traffickers, and Islamist insurgents, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] while leaving a mosque in the Puntland city of Bossaso. In July, the IMB <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/maritime-piracy-has-doubled-in-first.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that pirate attacks around the globe doubled in the first half of 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for Nigeria&#39;s Federal High Court on Wednesday ordered <a href="http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/LinksReadPrint.asp?blurb=640">Vice President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [Online Nigeria profile] to assume executive powers due to the prolonged absence of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile], who has been in Saudi Arabia receiving treatment for a heart condition since November. The court ruled that Nigeria&#39;s <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">1999 Constitution</a> [text], which allows the president&#39;s executive power to be carried out through the vice president, made it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iK9iGRDPnstYXauBU307suIKgvQw">proper</a> [AFP report] for Jonathan to assume executive powers. The court <a href="http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/Home/5511451-146/jonathan_needs_yaraduas_letter_to_become.csp">refused</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Next</span> report] to order Jonathan sworn in as acting president, finding that the constitution would not allow Jonathan to assume the role unless Yar&#39;Adua formally transferred presidential powers to him. On Tuesday, Yar&#39;Adua conducted an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8453321.stm">interview</a> [BBC report] with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> [media website], promising to return to power and putting to rest rumors that he was critically ill or dead. Yar-Adua&#39;s absence has sparked protests and calls for him to step down.<br /><br />In 2008, the Nigerian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/nigeria-high-court-upholds-contested.php">upheld</a> the results of <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-ruling-party-wins-poll-but-eu.php">disputed 2007 election</a> that brought Yar&#39;Adua to power, despite opposition groups&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. Yar&#39;Adua had promised to step down if the court invalidated the election. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-creates-election-tribunal-ahead.php">tribunal</a> [JURIST report] formed before the 2007 election to deal with allegations of fraud ruled that the opposition groups lacked enough evidence of fraud to have the results overturned.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mongolian <a href="http://www.president.mn/eng/president/biography.php">President Elbegdorj Tsakhia</a> [official profile] announced Thursday that he would <a href="http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=122">suspend</a> [speech text] the <a href="/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] and commute the sentences of all prisoners currently on death row to 30 years in prison. In a lengthy speech to the Mongolian Parliament, Tsakhia called for a permanent ban on the death penalty, saying that many mistakes are made in its administration, and that the system has been abused by those with power. He cited statistics from <a href="http://www.amnesty.mn/en/index.php">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], showing that one in three death sentences were overturned by a court of appeals, as proof that oftentimes the sentence was wrongfully imposed. Tsakhia said:<br /><blockquote><br />It is not the fault of the people of Mongolia that Mongolia maintains the death penalty. And it is not the fault of our judiciary to practice this punishment. Our judges have endeavored to render just judgments and have been working to repair those decisions deemed unjust. Yet, I cannot firmly say, no mistakes have been made here. Similarly, I cannot say, no mistakes will be made. The price we pay for mistakes in delivering the truth is measured in human lives. Humans work in courts, judiciaries. After all, no human being is alien to mistakes.<br /></blockquote> <br />AI had previously <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/secrecy-surrounds-death-penalty-20080415">criticized</a> [press release] for a lack of transparency in its administration of the death penalty. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/good-news/mongolia-announces-moratorium-executions-20100114">welcomed</a> [press release] Thursday&#39;s announcement.<br /><br />In November, the <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/">Russian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-constitutional-court-extends.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium on the death penalty until the country&#39;s parliament ratifies an international treaty abolishing capital punishment. In July, <a href="http://www.handsoffcain.info/">Hands Off Cain</a> [advocacy website], an anti-death penalty advocacy group, <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/executions-down-worldwide-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number of countries with capital punishment, as well as the total number of executions was down in 2008 from the previous year. According to Amnesty International, 95 countries have <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/countries-abolitionist-for-all-crimes">abolished</a> [AI report] the death penalty for all crimes. In March, New Mexico became the latest US state to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=5&Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] to be tried for his video and printed statements against the Quran and Islam, dismissing a motion to drop or reduce the criminal charges. The trial court <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2459165.ece/Wilders_to_be_tried_for_hate_speech">denied</a> [NRC report] Wilder&#39;s counsel&#39;s argument that he could not be prosecuted according to a 2009 Supreme Court ruling, which held that insulting a religion, as opposed to its followers, was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/13/world/AP-EU-Netherlands-Hate-Speech.html">not punishishable under hate-speech laws</a> [NYT report].  Wilders has been charged by the Dutch <a href="http://www.om.nl/">Public Prosecution Service</a> (OM) [official website, in Dutch] with five counts of religious insult and anti-Muslim incitement.<br /><br />In September, the OM announced that they would <a href="http://www.om.nl/algemene_onderdelen/uitgebreid_zoeken/@151903/wilders_wordt/">prosecute Wilders</a> [press release, in Dutch] following a January 2009 <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BH0496&u_ljn=BH0496">court order</a> [press release, in Dutch] by the Amsterdam Court of Appeals. This decision came after the OM announced in June 2008 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/dutch-judiciary-will-not-prosecute.php">not prosecute Wilders</a> [JURIST report]. Much of the controversy stems from Wilders&#39; 15-minute film, <em>Fitna</em>, which shows images of the Quran alongside images of violence and says democratic values are threatened by the increasing number of Muslims in Europe. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the film <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-sg-condemns-offensively-anti-islamic.php">&quot;offensively anti-Islamic&quot;</a> [JURIST report] after its release. In February 2008, Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/pakistan-blocks-youtube-over.php">blocked access</a> to YouTube&#39;s website because it had posted a movie trailer for Wilders&#39; film, but access was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/pakistan-lifts-youtube-ban-over.php">restored</a> [JURIST reports] several days later. Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/indonesia-lifts-ban-on-file-sharing.php">followed suit</a> [JURIST report] in April 2008. The same month, a district court in the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dutch-court-refuses-to-bar-anti-islam.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by the Dutch Islamic Federation to block Wilders&#39; anti-Quran statements, saying that his comments are protected by the right of free expression and do not constitute speech that incites hate or violence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/09A648.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that the trial on the constitutionality of California&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] ban may not be broadcast because the court did not follow proper procedure when enacting a rule permitting the broadcast. Last week, Judge Vaughn Walker of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the trial could be broadcast live to five federal courthouses and posted to the court&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [website] channel. In staying the broadcast, the Supreme Court ruled that there was a significant likelihood that the district court had not allowed enough time for the public to comment between proposing and enacting the rule, which ended a ban on recording court proceedings in certain cases. The Court also found that the high-profile nature of the trial might intimidate witnesses and cause irreparable harm if the rule were not stayed. In an unsigned opinion, the Court stated:<br /><blockquote><br />The District Court attempted to change its rules at the eleventh hour to treat this case differently than other trials in the district. Not only did it ignore the federal statute that establishes the procedures by which its rules may be amended, its express purpose was to broadcast a high-profile trial that would include witness testimony about a contentious issue. If courts are to require that others follow regular procedures, courts must do so as well.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor. The Court&#39;s order will be in effect until it hears an appeal relating to televised court proceedings.<br /><br />Wednesday&#39;s order continues a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks.php">temporary stay</a> ordered by the Supreme Court Monday, the same day the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-federal-court-begins.php">trial began</a> [JURIST reports]. Supporters of Proposition 8 have objected to the controversial decision to broadcast the trial proceedings, claiming it would result in witness intimidation. The YouTube broadcast of the case, <a href="https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> [case materials], was to be allowed under an experimental program approved by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] last month that allows cameras in civil, non-jury cases. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008.

		<title>Federal judge rules New York City discriminated against firefighter applicants</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Wednesday <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cv/2010/7cv2067mo011310.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that New York City intentionally discriminated against minority fire department applicants by continuing to use an exam that it knew placed those applicants at a disadvantage. Judge Nicholas Garaufis of the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/index.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] called the practice a &quot;stain&quot; on the fire department. While Garaufis did find that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was shielded from the suit by qualified immunity, he noted that the mayor was, &quot;deliberately indifferent to the exams&#39; impact on blacks.&quot; In summarizing his reasons for granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs, Garaufis wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />What the Intervenors have demonstrated - and what the City has failed to rebut - is that the City&#39;s use of written exams with discriminatory impacts and little relation to the job of firefighter was not a one-time mistake or the product of benign neglect. It was part of a pattern, practice, and policy of intentional discrimination against black applicants that has deep historical antecedents and uniquely disabling effects. The consequences that this illegal policy had for blacks who wished to serve their city as firefighters have already been levied; the consequences that this illegal policy will have for the City will be addressed at the remedial stage.<br /></blockquote><br />Garaufis&#39; ruling was the second on the issue. In July, he <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/09.07.22_Garaufis%20Vulcans%20Opinion.pdf">granted summary judgment</a> [order, PDF] to the plaintiffs, ruling that the application exam employed by the city was discriminatory. The city is expected to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/nyregion/14fire.html">appeal the ruling</a> [NYT report].<br /><br />In June 2009, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/high-court-finds-title-vii-violation-in.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the dismissal of a suit by firefighters in New Haven, CT, finding reverse discrimination in violation of Title VII. In that suit, white firefighters alleged that an exam was incorrectly excluded from consideration for promotions because minority applicants performed more poorly than white applicants. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">another firefighter suit</a> [JURIST report] during the current term, this time concerning when the statute of limitations begins to run for filing a disparate impact charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://go.telegraph.co.uk/?id=296X683&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F6e1y9r%26ei%3DoCROS66mJNCu4Qbfv53yDw%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dmicroblog_result%26resnum%3D1%26ct%3Dresult%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CAgQoAQoADAA%26usg%3DAFQjCNGHJXxckE9_TXFRnZPH7HRQip7KPw">reinstated</a> [opinion, PDF] an antitrust lawsuit that accuses major record labels of price-fixing nearly 80 percent of US digital music sales. In overturning a lower court decision to dismiss the case, the appeals court found that the defendants, music industry giants including Sony, Time Warner, EMI, Universal, and Virgin Records, may have been in violation of the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a> [text], which established the country&#39;s antitrust laws. The court held, &quot;that Plaintiffs-Appellants&#39; Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (&quot;SCAC&quot;) contains &#39;enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made,&#39; and therefore states a claim.&quot; The court did not rule on the merits of the case, which was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.<br /><br />The case combined lawsuits filed in 2005 and 2006 by people who had downloaded music from the Internet. Wednesday&#39;s ruling is the latest in an ongoing conflict between the music industry and consumers who download music online. In July, a federal judge ruled that Boston University graduate student <a href="http://joelfightsback.com/">Joel Tenenbaum</a> [defense website] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-judge-finds-student-liable-in.php">liable</a> [JURIST report] for illegally downloading music, fining him $675,000. In the only other file-sharing case to go to trial, Jammie Thomas-Rasset was found liable and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-jury-assesses-192-million.php">fined $1.92 million</a> [JURIST report] in June. These suits may be the last to be brought to trial, as the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [organization website] decided in 2008 to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue pursuing</a> [JURIST report] court cases against those accused of illegal file-sharing.

Mike Mullen</a> [official profile], have advised him to delay an internal effort to repeal the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">&quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot;</a> [10 USC &sect; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>] policy, according to a Thursday Associated Press <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GAYS_IN_MILITARY?SITE=FLROC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">report</a> [text]. Mullen has reportedly received mixed input on whether lifting the ban is a good idea, with other Pentagon advisers suggesting that repealing the policy would not cause problems, but in-house legal counsel has advised him to wait until 2011. The delay would most likely make the policy a key issue in the 2012 presidential election.<br /><br />US President Barack Obama recently <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to end the controversial policy, which subjects openly gay individuals to military discharge. After the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-declines-to-review.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to review the policy in June, the US Senate <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-committee-to-hold-hearings-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would hold hearings to review it. Last year, more than 100 retired admirals and generals of the US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/retired-top-military-officers-call-for.php">called for a repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the policy.

A senior researcher at the <a href="http://www.cnlg.gov.rw/index.htm">Rwanda National Commission for the Fight Against Genocide</a> (CNLG) [official website] said that they are <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14140&article=24794">preparing a bill</a> [<em>New Times</em> report] for presentation to the Ministry of Culture. The proposed legislation would then have to go before the cabinet and eventually be approved by parliament. The CNLG has planned an international conference for early February to discuss the conservation of human remains from the genocide, in which more than 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, were killed.<br /><br />Rwanda would not be the first country to enact a law criminalizing denial of a genocide. Israel passed the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Anti-Semitism+and+the+Holocaust/Documents+and+communiques/Denial+of+Holocaust+-Prohibition-+Law-+5746-1986-.html">Denial of Holocaust Prohibition Law</a> [text] in 1986, and Switzerland has a <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/311_0/a261bis.html">law</a> [text, in German] that makes genocide denial an imprisonable offense. In 2007, the European Union <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/eu-approves-framework-decision.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a framework decision that would criminalize denial of the Holocaust.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government reiterated its <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/fyrbt/t651499.htm">commitment to open Internet</a> [press briefing, in Chinese] on Thursday, saying that international companies are welcome as long as they abide by Chinese law. Responding to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">threat</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website] that it may remove its Internet services from the country, <a href="chn">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson Jiang Yu said that, &quot;China has tried creating a favorable environment for the Internet.&quot; Jiang also stated that hacker attacks, such as those that allegedly <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-hack-attack/">occurred against Google and several other companies</a> [Wired report] in December, are against Chinese law. The Chinese government is <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/13/content_12804080.htm">seeking clarification</a> [Xinhua report] of Google&#39;s intentions, including the statement by Google that it will stop filtering search results. As Xinhua noted, as of Wednesday, Google was still filtering search results, consistent with Chinese government policy.<br /><br />Google announced a new policy towards China on Tuesday in response to a cyber attack on its Gmail service in December. That attack targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists in China, and drew the ire of rights groups around the world. China&#39;s stance on Internet freedom, a source of contention in its relationship with Google, has long been controversial. In June, the Chinese government confirmed that <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-official-affirms-that.php">filtering software</a> [JURIST report] which is to be sold with every computer in China did not necessarily have to be activated. That confirmation came only after the policy of pre-packaging the software with new computers was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-internet-censorship-policy.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by human rights lawyer Li Fangping.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for convicted terrorism conspirator <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> [JURIST news archive] argued Tuesday before the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] that their client&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] should be overturned.

Prosecutors countered that Padilla&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">17-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] for a crime that is punishable by life imprisonment is <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/81300517.html">too lenient</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia Inquirer</span> report.

He was convicted, along with Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifadh Wael Jayyousi, of conspiracy to commit illegal violent acts outside the US, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, and providing material support to terrorists. Padilla, a US citizen, was arrested in 2002 at Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare International Airport and subsequently detained as an <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">&quot;enemy combatant&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] at a Navy military brig in Charleston, South Carolina. Initially alleged to have planned the explosion of a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; in the US, Padilla went from enemy combatant to criminal defendant when he was finally charged with other offenses in November 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Representatives of Canada&#39;s Inuit population on Wednesday <a href="http://www.itk.ca/media-centre/media-releases/inuit-sue-european-union-eu-overturn-seal-product-import-ban-defending-i">announced</a> [press release] a lawsuit against the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] challenging its impending ban on the sale of seal products. The suit, filed in the General Court of the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">Court of Justice of the EU</a> [official website], seeks to overturn <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2009/november/tradoc_145264.pdf">Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009</a> [text, PDF], which is expected to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8033498.stm">take effect</a> [BBC report] prior to the 2010 seal hunting season. President of <a href="http://www.itk.ca/">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami</a> (ITK) [organization website] <a href="http://www.itk.ca/national-inuit-leader-mary-simon-president-itk">Mary Simon</a> [profile] said:<br /><blockquote><br />Inuit have been hunting seals and sustaining themselves for food, clothing, and trade for many generations. ... It is bitterly ironic that the EU, which seems entirely at home with promoting massive levels of agri-business and the raising and slaughtering of animals in highly industrialized conditions, seeks to preach some kind of selective elevated morality to Inuit.<br /></blockquote><br />The legislation suggests a partial exemption for seals hunted by Inuit, though its terms are not defined.  <br /><br />The Canadian government <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2009/327.aspx">took action</a> [press release] against the ban in November, initiating the <a href="http://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) [official website] dispute resolution process by requesting consultations. The ban follows <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/07/27/seal-hunt-ban-eu476.html">extensive public pressure</a> [CBC report] to end seal hunting by groups citing humanitarian considerations. More narrow European restrictions imposed in 1983 caused the industry to suffer a sharp decline. Commercial seal hunting is an <a href="http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/seal-phoque/eco_cult-eng.htm">economic and cultural staple</a> [DFO materials] for the Inuit, who contend that their methods are necessary and humane.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/superior/index.jsp">Superior Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.dcboee.org/pdf_files/nr_242.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that a law allowing Washington DC to recognize <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] performed elsewhere is not subject to a public referendum. Reverend Harry Jackson, along with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011402616.html">39 Republican congressmen</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Wasington Post</span> report], urged the court to force the DC Council to allow the public to vote on DC&#39;s <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20090511122519.pdf">Jury and Marriage Amendment Act of 2009</a> (JAMA) [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/dc-begins-recognizing-same-sex.php">report</a>]. The judge refused, affirming a November <a href="http://www.dcboee.org/pdf_files/nr_227.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/dc-board-rejects-ballot-initiative.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.dcboee.org/">District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics</a> [official website], which held that putting the act to a public vote would violate DC&#39;s <a href="http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view,a,3,q,491858,ohrNav,|30953|.asp">Human Rights Act</a> [text]. It is unknown whether Jackson will appeal.<br /><br />Last month, the DC Council gave both its <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/jmdc-council-passes-same-sex-marriage.php">preliminary</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">final approval</a> [JURIST reports] to the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20091008141223.pdf">Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF], which would allow same-sex marriages to be performed in DC. Mayor Adrian Fenty must still sign the law, and Congress must not act to block it before it goes into effect. If the marriage bill becomes law, DC will become the sixth US jurisdiction to recognize marriage between same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five US states - <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Spanish lawmaker Saturday expressed anger over the use of his image as a basis for an <a href="http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=Bin_Laden&language=english">FBI mock-up</a> [Rewardsforjustice.net reward poster] of <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive], saying he would like a formal explanation and may file a lawsuit. The FBI admitted to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/17/osama.photo.fbi/index.html">using an image</a> [CNN report] of Spanish MP <a href="http://www.izquierda-unida.es/elecciones2004/gaspar/01.htm">Gaspar Llamazares</a> [official profile, in Spanish], the former leader of the <a href="http://www.izquierda-unida.es/">United Left Coalition</a> [party website in Spanish], as the basis for an age-progressed picture of Bin Laden for its <a href="http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/index.cfm?page=main&language=english">Rewards for Justice</a> [official website] program. The FBI <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34894217/ns/world_news-europe/">explained</a> [AP report] that a forensic analyst working on the updated picture resorted to using Llamazares&#39; image after he could not find suitable features in the file photographs of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archives] leader. The FBI said there was no ill motive. Llamazares <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5i0DbfZd2MPxryKMXf3ceYLncdAAQ">said</a> [Canadian Press report] he was disappointed at the intelligence agency&#39;s actions and that he now feared traveling to the United States.<br /><br />Osama bin Laden is <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6991299.ece">currently believed</a> [<em>Times</em> report] to be hiding out in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The most recent contact with Bin Laden is believed to be a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1107AP_Bin_Laden_Tape_Text.html">audio tape</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/bin-laden-tape-claims-moussaoui.php">report</a>] from 2006. In the recording, a man claiming to be bin Laden said that convicted <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11</a> [JURIST news archive] conspirator <a href="/currentawareness/moussaoui.php">Zacarias Moussaoui</a> [JURIST news archive] was not intended to be one of September 11 hijackers as he had not finished his flying training, and that &quot;his confession that he was assigned to participate in those raids is a false confession which no intelligent person doubts is a result of the pressure put upon him for the past four and a half years.&quot; The man on the tape also indicated those held in <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] did not play any role in the September 11 attacks either. Bin Laden&#39;s whereabouts were last confirmed in 2001 when he avoided airstrikes while hiding in the mountains of Afghanistan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/hearings/">testified</a> [hearing materials] before the <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/">Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission</a> (FCIC) that combating financial fraud is a priority for the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites]. When asked whether the reallocation of DOJ staff from financial fraud to terrorism investigations over the past decade had thwarted efforts to fight white collar crime, Holder responded that terrorism investigations were not preventing the DOJ from making financial fraud a &quot;real priority.&quot; In <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/testimony/2010/ag-testimony-100114.html">prepared remarks</a> [text], Holder said: <br /><blockquote><br />[T]he Justice Department is using every tool at our disposal - including new resources, advanced technologies and communications capabilities, and the very best talent we have - to prevent, prosecute and punish these crimes. And by taking dramatic action, our goal is not just to hold accountable those whose conduct may have contributed to the last meltdown, but to deter such future conduct as well.<br /></blockquote><br />The FCIC was established late last year by the <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/files/FCIC-statute.pdf">Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF] to &quot;examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.&quot;<br /><br />US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/obama-signs-executive-order.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-financial-fraud-enforcement-task-force">executive order</a> [text] in November that created a Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to be headed by the DOJ. The task force, which continues the work of and replaces the federal government&#39;s Corporate Fraud Task Force, is charged with building on &quot;efforts already underway to combat mortgage, securities and corporate fraud by increasing coordination and fully utilizing the resources and expertise of the government&#39;s law enforcement and regulatory apparatus.&quot; This effort to battle <a href="/currentawareness/corporatefraud.php">corporate fraud</a> [JURIST news archive] is part of a wide-ranging plan for financial reform that includes new <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">legislation</a> and executive <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">proposals</a> [JURIST reports] intended to strengthen legislation and limit loopholes. Members of the Obama administration have <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/treasury-secretary-to-propose.php">proposed</a> strengthening regulations and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-restricts-executive-compensation.php">increasing restrictions on financial institutions</a> [JURIST report] in response to the current financial crisis.

Speaking days after a devastating earthquake hit the Caribbean nation Tuesday, Napolitano said that &quot;[p]roviding a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this Administration&#39;s continuing efforts to support Haiti&#39;s recovery.&quot; Groups such as the <a href="http://www.aila.org/">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a> (AILA) and the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/home/index.htm">NAACP</a> [advocacy websites] had called on the administration to grant Haitians TPS and halt any deportation or removal proceedings against some of them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ictj.org/static/MENA/Iraq/iraq.statute.engtrans.pdf">Supreme Iraq Criminal Tribunal</a> [governing statute, PDF] sentenced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2855349.stm">Ali Hassan al-Majid</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=majid">news archive</a>] to death by hanging on Sunday, finding him guilty of having ordered the Kurdish village of Halabja gassed in 1988. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8463955.stm">gassing of Halabja</a> [BBC report], which killed 5,000 Kurds, was part of the wider <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anfal">Anfal campaign</a> [JURIST news archive] against Kurds in Iraq during the Saddam Hussein regime, and is considered one of the worst attacks on the ethnic minority. Though al-Majid, who is better known by his sobriquet &quot;Chemical Ali,&quot; has the right to appeal, Iraq deputy justice minister Busho Ibrahim said that his hanging <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/17/chemical-ali-hanged-iraq">was expected within days</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> report]. Al-Majid, who has already been sentenced to death three other times, has still more alleged crimes to his name, but those will not go to trial. <br /><br />In March 2009, al-Majid received his third death sentence for his role in a 1999 <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">killing of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who rioted in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr. In December 2008, the Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraqi-tribunal-gives-chemical-ali.php">sentenced al-Majid to death</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq during the Saddam regime. Al-Majid has also been sentenced to death for the another killing of Kurdish Iraqis using chemical weapons during the 1988 Anfal campaign. His death sentence in the first Anfal case was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iraq-tribunal-upholds-death-sentences.php">upheld on appeal</a> in September 2007, but Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council did not <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-approves.php">approve the execution</a> [JURIST reports] until late February. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#39;s government said in early March that al-Majid <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-pm-says-no-chemical-ali-execution.php">would not be executed</a> [JURIST report] until the Presidency Council approved the death sentences of al-Majid&#39;s two co-defendants in that case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Obama administration is considering bringing charges in a Washington, DC, federal court against <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2346225.stm">Riduan Isamuddin</a> [BBC profile], the suspected planner of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombing</a> [BBC backgrounder], the Associated Press <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GUANTANAMO_TRIAL?SITE=NEYOR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">reported</a> [text] Friday. According to the AP, administration officials have begun a security review to determine what measures would need to be taken to pursue the case in federal court, and the move is part of a larger plan to bring other Guantanamo detainees to trial in federal courts in Washington and New York City. Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, is the former military commander of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ji.htm">Jemaah Islamiya</a> (JI) and was allegedly the main link between JI and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders] before his catpure in 2003. Former president George W. Bush cited the capture of Isamuddin as a major success in his policies in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=war+on+terror">war on terror</a>, after the enhanced interrogation of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">Khaled Shaikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archives] uncovered information on Isamuddin&#39;s whereabouts. The bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali killed 202 people. In 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/indonesia-ag-confirms-execution-of-3.php">three men were executed</a> [JURIST report] in Indonesia in connection with the bombings. <br /><br />Last week, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-guantanamo-detainee-referred-to.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] that Afghan Guantanamo detainee Obaidullah will be prosecuted by a military proceeding, becoming the sixth such recommendation made by the DOJ under the Obama administration. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that the government will pursue charges against the five suspected 9/11 conspirators in federal court in New York City. These decisions come as part of a larger effort to close the detention facility. Shortly after taking office, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">ordered Guantanamo closed</a> [JURIST report] by January 22, 2010, but he has recently stated that this deadline will not be met, echoing <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/guantanamo-closure-deadline-may-be.php">earlier statements</a> [JURIST report] by administration officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Honduran <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] judge on Thursday charged top military personnel with abuse of power for removing former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123134.stm">Manuel Zelaya</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zelaya">news archive</a>] from the country after he was ousted from power last June. Supreme Court President <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/ejes/CSJ/Integrantes/">Jorge Rivera</a> [official profile, in Spanish] issued charges against six military commanders, including armed forces commander Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, air force commander Venancio Cervantes, and naval commander Luis Javier Prince, and ordered them to remain in the country to testify before the court. Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-prosecutors-charge-military.php">asked the court to issue charges</a> [JURIST report] last week, arguing that individual military commanders violated the <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html">Honduran Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] when they seized Zelaya and put him on a plane to Costa Rica because the constitution prohibits the forcible removal of a citizen. The charges to do not question the presidential ouster itself.  Zelaya has <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/military-chiefs-charged-over-honduran-coup-20100107-lwut.html">dismissed the charges as a political move</a> [AFP report], claiming the prosecutors share as much responsibility as the military. The abuse of power charges carry a sentence of three to six years in prison.<br /><br />Zelaya remains in Honduras at the Brazilian embassy. Last month, the Honduran <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] voted 111-14 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/honduras-congress-rejects-zelaya.php">not to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] him. This followed a non-binding advisory opinion from the Supreme Court that Zelaya could <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/honduras-high-court-rules-zelaya-cannot.php">not legally return to office</a> [JURIST report]. Zelaya&#39;s return to power appears unlikely, as elections were held in November, and Porfirio Lobo is due to be sworn in as president later this month. Zelaya was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] in June, following a <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/general/noticias/Comunicado_Especial.htm">judicial order</a> [press release, in Spanish] asserting that he had broken Honduran law by attempting to conduct a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/honduras-president-proposes-vote-on.php">referendum on constitutional reform</a> [JURIST report], contrary to a Supreme Court ruling. Zelaya, along with the US, the UN, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the European Union, maintain that his removal was a coup, while the interim government of Roberto Micheletti asserts that it was a lawful transition of power.

The ratification passed with 392 <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/index.jsp?t=news/index.jsp&file=7767.html">votes</a> [results, Russian] out of 450. COE Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1571749&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">called the move</a> [statement] &quot;a significant decision by the State Duma, [that] will be of importance for the whole of Europe. ... By joining the other 46 member states, Russia is sending a strong signal of its commitment to Europe.&quot; Protocol 14 envisages reforms to increase efficiency of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], such as filtering out inadmissible and repetitive cases. Admissibility will be determined by a single judge, but most cases will still be ruled on by three-judge panel. Russia was initially opposed to ratifying the protocol, which it claimed was politically motivated.<br /><br />In June, the COE harshly criticized Russia&#39;s judicial system and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-judicial-reform-urged-by-council.php">called for reform</a> [JURIST report]. In recent years, Russia has had the largest number of cases pending in the ECHR out of any COE member-state. In <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/BBFE7733-3122-40F5-AACA-9B16827B74C2/0/Pending_applications_chart.pdf">2009</a> [statistics, PDF], Russia had 32,600 cases pending, followed next by Turkey, which had 12,800 cases pending, and in <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/96960736-30E5-40DE-BC54-28F374A60C0B/0/Pending_applications_chart.pdf">2008</a> [statistics, PDF] Russia had 27,250 cases pending, followed next by Turkey, which had 11,100 cases pending. In 2008, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] proposed that Russian courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">become more transparent</a> [JURIST report] in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the ECHR.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/news_release/2010/10-01-14.3a/10-01-14.3a.html">declined</a> [order] to hear an appeal brought by an anti-abortion advocate who refused to pay taxes on the basis that the money could be used to fund <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. David Little was convicted in 2007 of tax evasion for failing to file tax returns for 2000, 2001, and 2002. The <a href="http://www.gnb.ca/Cour/03COA1/index-e.asp">Court of Appeal of New Brunswick</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.gnb.ca/cour/03COA1/Decisions/2009/August2009/LittlevQueen-122-08-CA-August20.pdf">affirmed the conviction</a> [judgment, PDF] in August. Little&#39;s legal argument relied on Section 2(a) of the <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], which establishes and guarantees everyone in Canada the fundamental freedom of &quot;conscience and religion,&quot; as well as Section 15(1) which prohibits discrimination. The appeals court rejected Little&#39;s arguments:<br /><blockquote><br />The non-filing of annual returns, like the non-payment of taxes, does not qualify as a religious practice nor has it become the tenet of any religious faith. The refusals are simply acts of civil disobedience intended to bring about change in government policy, the law, or both. Admittedly, the refusals may be the product of an informed conscience, but the Charter was not intended to insulate such acts from the rule of law. Otherwise, everyone who disagrees with government policies and the expenditure of public monies in furtherance of those policies would be entitled to abandon their obligation to bear their proportionate share of the national debt while continuing to receive no-cost public benefits such as Medicare.<br /></blockquote><br />With the Supreme Court&#39;s decision not to review the case, Little&#39;s <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2441003">conviction will stand</a> [<em>National Post</em> report]. He has until April 25 to file his back taxes and pay the court-ordered fine of $1,000 or serve 22 days in jail for each of the three years in the conviction, but Little refuses to do either. After the Supreme Court&#39;s decision, Little challenged the government, asking: &quot;Are they going to put me in jail for the rest of my life?&quot; <br /><br />While abortion rights remain a controversial issue, so too do the rights of anti-abortion activists. In the US, anti-abortion protesters have recently challenged several laws limiting their ability to protest. In November, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-strikes-down-abortion.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a City of Pittsburgh ordinance that created a layered zone structure to prevent protesters from gathering outside abortion facilities, finding that the law was not sufficiently narrowly tailored. In July, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/first-circuit-upholds-law-requiring.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Massachusetts law prohibiting people from protesting directly outside of abortion clinics. The court ruled that the law, which created a 35-foot buffer zone around entrances and exits of reproductive health clinics, was a reasonable response to a significant threat to public safety. In 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ninth-circuit-upholds-right-to-display.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the First Amendment protected an anti-abortion group&#39;s right to display graphic pictures of early-term aborted fetuses outside of a California middle school.

The court of appeals in Kiev reviewed evidence for two days before determining the officials&#39; guilt, but <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/56954/">chose not to pursue</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kyiv Post</span> report] further criminal proceedings because all of the defendants are deceased. The decision follows the conclusion of an SBU investigation that <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/sbu/control/en/publish/article?art_id=87219&cat_id=84548&mustWords=genocide&searchPublishing=1">began in May 2009</a> [press release] and relied heavily on declassified Soviet documents. Speaker of the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">Russian State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="http://www.gryzlov.ru/">Boris Gryzlov</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="http://www.gryzlov.ru/index.php?page=events&id=4791">responded to the announcement</a> [Interfax report, in Russian], labeling it a politically motivated effort to incite tension between the countries.<br /><br />Known as Holodomor, which translates to &#8216;murder by hunger,&#8217; the famine is responsible for an estimated <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4471256.stm">seven to 10 million deaths</a> [BBC report]. Russians contend that the event was a byproduct of unfavorable conditions, though others believe Soviet policies that disrupted the production and distribution of crops are to blame. Ukraine has long sought widespread international recognition of the famine as an act of genocide, though only several nations have done so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-nsd-038.html">announced</a> [press release] on Thursday that four men have been charged in connection with the November 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">terror attacks in Mumbai, India</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+2008">news archive</a>] and an attempted attack on a Danish newspaper. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2010/pr0114_01a.pdf">superseding indictment</a> [text, PDF] reiterates the 12 charges against Chicago resident and US citizen David Coleman Headley <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/chicago-man-charged-in-2008-mumbai.php">filed last month</a> [JURIST report] and adds three defendants.  Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago resident with Canadian citizenship, is charged with three counts of providing material support to terrorism, one each for his alleged roles in the Denmark plan and Mumbai attacks, and a third for alleged involvement with terrorist organization <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder]. Retired Pakistani military officer Abdur Rehman and Ilyas Kashmiri, an alleged terrorist leader believed to have ties to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], are also named in the indictment. Both face one count of conspiracy and one count of providing material support to terrorism for their alleged participation in the Danish newspaper plot. Headley and Rana are in federal custody, though no date has been set for Rana&#39;s arraignment before the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website]. Rehman and Kashmiri remain at-large.<br /><br />The lone surviving suspected gunman from the Mumbai attacks, <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab</a> [NDTV profile], is currently on trial in India after <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-withdraws.php">withdrawing his confession</a> [JURIST report] last month. Kasab claims to have met Headley, but only after the attacks when Headley allegedly came to question Kasab in the company of three FBI agents. The judge hearing the trial has removed lawyers representing Kasab on two separate occasions for ethical violations, once in <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/india-judge-removes-mumbai-terror.php">April</a> and again in <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/india-court-removes-defense-lawyer-for.php">November</a> [JURIST reports]. A verdict is expected early next year, and, if convicted, Kasab could face the death penalty. The Anti-Terrorism Court of Pakistan has <a href="http://www.india-server.com/news/pakistans-anti-terrorism-court-reserves-16586.html"></a><a href="/paperchase/2009/09/pakistan-to-indict-seven-for-2008.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] seven men accused of planning the attacks, charging them under Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/document/actsandordinences/anti_terrorism.htm">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text]. The men, who allegedly belong to LeT, have pleaded not guilty. Pakistan has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/pakistan-court-begins-trial-of-5-mumbai.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of five others allegedly connected with the 2008 attack, which claimed at least 170 lives at 10 locations across the city.

Police reported Thursday that Gao, who has been in police custody since February, went missing in September. Gao&#39;s brother, Gao Zhiyi, stated Thursday that police believe his brother &quot;got lost and went missing while out on a walk.&quot; Suspicions abound among rights groups, however, that Gao has been tortured or killed. <br /><br />Gao drew international attention in September 2007 when he wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/chinese-lawyer-detained-for-sending.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to the US Congress requesting assistance in improving human rights in China. Gao, who has also defended Christians and coal miners in China, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/14/world/AP-AS-China-Missing-Lawyer.html?_r=2">claimed</a> [AP report] that he was tortured after his arrest in 2007. Gao was originally part of the Chinese Communist Party and handled prominent cases involving the outlawed <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong movement</a> [Falun Dafa website], but fell into disfavor with the government in 2006 when he was <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gao+zhisheng">convicted of subversion</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest. China has long received <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+rights">criticism</a> [JURIST news archive] from watchdog groups for its treatment of rights activists such as Gao.

Aziz, who also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, was taken to an American hospital for treatment and is now said to be in stable condition, though he is paralyzed and unable to speak. His health has been poor since his arrest by American forces in 2003, and his family, who are Catholic, have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jd2cG1yFn5_mDPjbFNfeqZeXulmA">lobbied the pope for his release</a> [AP report]. Aziz still faces charges from the current Iraq government, which has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/world/middleeast/18ali.html">refused to delay proceedings against him</a> [NYT report] to wait for his recovery. <br /><br />Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-court-convicts-top-saddam.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of displacing Kurds during the 1980s. The sentence extended Aziz&#39;s prison term to a total of 22 years following a March <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the 1992 murders of 42 merchants accused of price-gouging during UN-imposed sanctions. Prior to his March conviction, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the 1999 killing of protesters who rioted in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx">strongly criticized</a> [press release; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33491&Cr=discrimination&Cr1=">report</a>] <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">proposed legislation</a> [text, PDF] in Uganda which would implement harsh punishments for homosexual behavior, including the death penalty in some circumstances. The bill includes provisions which would allow sentences of life imprisonment for people who are be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered, and also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hzFUQYJRaLKpbQr58-4Nx1diB5UA">allows the death penalty</a> [AFP report] in situations of &quot;aggravated homosexuality,&quot; which includes the rape of a minor or where an individual carries the AIDS virus. The bill also imposes punishments of up to three years in prison for those who fail to report the identity of a person who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered within 24 hours, including family members. Pillay emphasized what she characterized as &quot;blatantly discriminatory&quot; nature of the bill, and also discussed the international human rights implications of the legislation:<blockquote>It is extraordinary to find legislation like this being proposed more than 60 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &#8211; as well as many subsequent international laws and standards &#8211; made it clear this type of discrimination is unacceptable.<br /><br />I would like to remind the Ugandan Government of the country&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law. Uganda is a party to the core human rights treaties and has generally had a good track record of cooperation with the various international human rights mechanisms. This bill threatens to seriously damage the country&#39;s reputation in the international arena.</blockquote>Pillay said she was somewhat reassured by indications that Ugandan <a href="http://www.statehouse.go.ug/president.htm">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [official profile] would <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8456624.stm">not support</a> [BBC report] the bill. <br /><br />The bill was originally <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8308912.stm">introduced</a> [BBC report] in October by David Bahati, an MP from the ruling <a href="http://www.nrm.ug/">National Resistance Movement</a> (NRM)[party website]. Bahati has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/08/world/AP-AF-Uganda-Gay-Death-Penalty.html">described</a> [AP report] the bill as an attempt to prevent the recognition of homosexuality and to protect children from sexual abuse. Earlier this month, Bahati <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/08/world/AP-AF-Uganda-Gay-Death-Penalty.html">refused</a> [AP report] calls from the government to withdraw the bill amid fears that it reduce foreign investment.  Uganda currently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8412962.stm">criminalizes</a> [BBC report] homosexual behavior with up to 14 years in prison. The Ugandan parliament is expected to debate the bill in late February or early March.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The corruption trial of Italian <a href="http://www.governo.it/Presidente/index.html">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official website, in Italian; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">profile</a>] resumed Friday but was immediately postponed to February 27. Judges for the tenth section of the <a href="http://www.tribunale-milano.net/index.phtml?Id_VMenu=1">Milan Tribunal</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/10_gennaio_15/berlusconi-processo-mills_b521961c-01d0-11df-866a-00144f02aabe.shtml">postponed the trial</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</span> report, in Italian] as requested by Berlusconi&#39;s lawyers but refused their request to have earlier proceedings thrown out. Berlusconi is accused of paying his former lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive] as much as $600,000 to Mills to provide false testimony at two trials in 1997 and 1998 involving Berlusconi&#39;s broadcasting company, <a href="http://www.gruppomediaset.it/indexgruppo.jsp?lang=EN">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian]. Berlusconi&#39;s trial was postponed so that Mills&#39;s final appeal of his conviction and sentence will be concluded. Berlusconi&#39;s lawyers <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gnJL11ohNAFK8Mgib159DtlwCEHQ">argued</a> [CP report] that the the Mills case might affect his, and the statute of limitations has been frozen until a new date.<br /><br />This is the second time the corruption case against Berlusconi has been reopened and then <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/berlusconi-corruption-trial-to-resume.php">delayed</a> since a law granting him immunity from prosecution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/italy-high-court-strikes-down-immunity.php">thrown out</a> [JURIST reports] by the Italian <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/index.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] in October. He is also facing a separate trial for tax fraud which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-court-adjourns-berlusconi-tax.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] in November until this month. Berlusconi has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports]. In October 2007, Berlusconi&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/berlusconi-acquitted-of-bribery-charges.php">acquittal</a> on bribery charges was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/italy-high-court-upholds-berlusconi.php">upheld</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2005, Berlusconi was acquitted of corruption charges despite testimony accusing him of giving <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">kickbacks to the late Socialist premier Bettino Craxi</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.af/PVE/Default.aspx">Wolesi Jirga</a> [official website], Afghanistan&#39;s lower house of Parliament, Saturday narrowly <a href="http://www.sabawoon.com/articles/index.php?page=cabinet">approved</a> [Sabawoon report; partly in  Arabic] Habibullah Galib as the country&#39;s new Minister of Justice but overall <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/01/16/afghanistan.karzai.cabinet/">rejected</a> [CNN report] 10 of President Hamid Karzai&#39;s 17 nominees for cabinet positions, Karzai&#39;s second such setback in two weeks. A McClatchy Newspapers <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/82481.html">report</a> quoted Sima Samar, director of the <a href="http://www.aihrc.org.af/English/">Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website] as saying that Ghalib&#39;s appointment was &quot;a backwards step.&quot; Earlier this month, the Jirga  <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-lower-house-rejects-karzai.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] 17 out of 24 initial Karzai cabinet nominees, including incumbent Justice Minister <a href="http://www.moj.gov.af/?lang=en&p=e2">Sarwar Danish</a> [official profile] after he was criticized for his inability to control Afghan jails and the mistreatment of detainees in Afghan Custody.<br /><br />Karzai&#39;s new list had <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100109/wl_nm/us_afghanistan_cabinet_2">omitted</a> [Reuters report] the names of all those rejected two weeks ago. Karzai was also forced to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/01/11/news/news-us-afghanistan-karzai.html">withdraw</a> [Reuters report] the name of one nominee after he could not return from Canada in time for nominations. Karzai&#39;s administration has been alleged to be rife with corruption. In November, Afghan authorities announced that they had questioned <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/afghan-cabinet-ministers-investigated.php">two cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges. Karzai had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/afghanistan-president-vows-to-fight.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] to fight corruption in his second term inaugural address amid pressure from the international community. Late last year Afghanistan was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-afghanistan-ranked-most-corrupt.php">ranked</a> [JURIST report] the second most corrupt country in the world by <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website], behind only Somalia.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-559.htm">Doe v. Reed</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/09-559_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Court will consider whether the First Amendment allows a state to compel the release of identity information about petition signers. The case arose over an order to publish the names of those who signed a Washington state petition to overturn a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/washington-passes-bill-expanding-rights.php">state law</a> [JURIST report] giving same-sex partners the same rights as married partners. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/28/09-35818.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the names should be released, but the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-blocks-release-of-names.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] in October. The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by Washington voters in November.<br /><br />In <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-337.htm">Krupski v. Costa Crociere</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/09-337_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Court will consider the appropriate construction of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule15.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(C)</a> [text], which permits an amended complaint to &quot;relate back&quot; for statute of limitation purposes when the amendment corrects a mistake concerning the proper party&#39;s identity. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/200816569.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the rule does not apply to substitution of the correct defendant for a related corporation with a similar name where the plaintiff has imputed knowledge of the identity of the added defendant prior to filing suit. The Court has been asked to resolve a circuit split on the issue.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-448.htm">Hardt v.

The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081896.U.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that &sect; 502(g)(1) provides a district court discretion to award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees only to a prevailing party.<br /><br />In <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-475.htm">Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/09-475_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Court will consider three issues: (1) whether the Ninth Circuit erred in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/24/07-16458.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] plaintiffs are specially exempt from the requirement of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to obtain an injunction; (2) whether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that a district court may enter an injunction sought to remedy a NEPA violation without conducting an evidentiary hearing sought by a party to resolve genuinely disputed facts directly relevant to the appropriate scope of the requested injunction; and (3) whether the Ninth Circuit erred when it affirmed a nationwide injunction entered prior to the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1239.pdf">Winter v.

Jackson</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/09-497_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Court will consider whether the district court is required in all cases to determine claims that an arbitration agreement subject to the <a href="district court required in all cases to determine claims that an arbitration agreement subject to the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") is unconscionable, even when the parties to the contract have clearly and unmistakably assigned this "gateway" issue to the arbitrator for decision?">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [materials] is unconscionable, even when the parties to the contract have clearly and unmistakably assigned this &quot;gateway&quot; issue to the arbitrator for decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The FBI illegally collected more than 2,000 telephone records between 2002 and 2006 by claiming the phone calls being made related to possible terrorism emergencies, according to a <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803982.html?nav=hcmodule&sub=AR&sid=ST2010011804299">report</a> [text] Tuesday. According to the article, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] will soon release a report that is expected to build on an OIG report issued in 2007, which showed the FBI had improperly obtained phone records. The FBI released a <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel10/exigentletters_011910.htm">statement</a> [text] responding to the article saying the practice was discontinued in 2006, and:<br /><blockquote><br />the Bureau did not have in place adequate internal controls to ensure that the appropriate process was used and that appropriate records were kept to document the basis of any request to the phone companies that did not require legal process. Steps were taken as early as 2006 to ensure similar situations do not occur in the future.<br /></blockquote><br />The FBI began the practice of allowing supervisors to authorize collection of phone records on the basis of emergency situations shortly after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Patriot+Act">Patriot Act</a> [JURIST news archive] was passed in October 2001. The collection of telephone records on the basis of non-existent emergencies is a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_119.html">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (ECPA) [text]. <br /><br />The discussion surrounding the expansion of government powers following enactment of the Patriot Act has been ongoing. The US Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/senate-committee-approves.php">voted to reauthorize</a> three of the Patriot Act in October, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">supported</a> [JURIST reports] by the DOJ. In July, former DOJ Office of Legal Counsel lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">John Yoo</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/bush-administration-lawyer-defends.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the Bush administration&#39;s use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wiretapping+OR+eavesdropping">warrantless wiretapping</a> [JURIST news archive] following the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/multi-agency-report-questions.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of a a multi-agency report questioning its effectiveness.<br /><br />1/20/10 - The OIG <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s1001r.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] has been released to the public.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Slovakia&#39;s <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.sk/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Slovak] announced Tuesday that the government will accept three inmates from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facility. The ministry stated that this was a &quot;gesture of solidarity&quot; in support of President Barack Obama&#39;s foreign policy. The <a href="http://slovakia.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy in Slovakia</a> [official website] released a statement stating:<br /><blockquote><br />The United States welcomes the announcement today by Slovak officials that the Government of Slovakia will accept 3 Guantanamo detainees for resettlement. The United States appreciates this act as a productive step in realizing President Obama&#39;s vision of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center once and for all. We have had fruitful cooperation with Slovak authorities on this issue and will continue to collaborate as called for by our Slovak allies.<br /></blockquote><br />The Slovak government gave no details on the nationality, date of arrival, or location of the inmates, citing security reasons.<br /><br />Earlier this week, a Spanish foreign ministry official confirmed that Spain will be accepting two detainees currently being held at Guantanamo Bay. Closure of the detention facility was initially due by January 22, 2010, but Obama recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/us/19gitmo.html?_r=1">confirmed</a> [NYT report] that this deadline would not be met. The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/jmb-delay-in-guantanamo-closure-due-to.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] blaming missteps by the Obama administration for the delay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday issued two <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/011910zor.pdf"><em>per curiam</em> opinions</a> [order list, PDF], remanded the case of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumia">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a> [JURIST news archive], and denied a preliminary injunction to Michigan in a dispute over Asian carp. The Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-652.htm">Beard v. Abu-Jamal</a> [docket] and granted the respondent&#39;s motion to proceed <span style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis</span>. The Court vacated the judgment below and remanded the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for further consideration in light of the Court&#39;s decision in <a href="Beard">Smith v. Spisak</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-reverses-sixth-circuit-in.php">report</a>]. The only issue is whether the Third Circuit erred in <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-backs-new.php">allowing a new sentencing hearing</a> [JURIST report] solely on the issue of life imprisonment or a death sentence. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-declines-to-review-mumia.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] Abu-Jamal&#39;s conviction in April. Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing police officer <a href="http://www.danielfaulkner.com/">Daniel Faulkner</a> [advocacy website] after Faulkner pulled over Abu-Jamal&#39;s brother for a traffic violation. The case has become a focal point for death penalty opponents, attracting the attention of artists, civil rights activists, and politicians.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-5270.pdf">Presley v. Georgia</a> [opinion, PDF], the Court ruled that a defendant&#39;s <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Sixth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [texts] right to a public trial was violated when the trial court excluded the public from the <span style="font-style:italic;">voir dire</span> of prospective jurors. The Court granted the petition for <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> and petitioner&#39;s motion for leave to proceed <span style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis</span> and reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia.<br /><br />In the capital case of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-5731.pdf">Wellons v. Hall</a> [opinion, PDF], the Court granted the petition for <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> and petitioner&#39;s motion for leave to proceed <span style="font-style:italic;">in forma pauperis</span>, vacated the decision below, and remanded the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for further consideration in light of the Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1114.pdf">Cone v. Bell</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-upholds-fcc-ban-on.php">report</a>]. The Court ruled in <u>Cone</u> that a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> court has the power to recognize that a state court erred in holding that state law precludes reviewing a claim and that a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> claim is not &quot;procedurally defaulted&quot; because it has been presented twice to the state court. Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts.<br /><br />In <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">Michigan v. Illinois</a> [JURIST report], the Court denied an injunction sought by Michigan to compel Illinois to close two waterways that allow invasive Asian carp to reach the Great Lakes. The Court issued the order without comment. The Court must still determine whether to reopen a longstanding controversy over the diversion canal, created in the 1890s to keep Chicago&#39;s sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan.<br /><br />Finally, the Supreme Court declined to review an order requiring the state of California to release more than 40,000 inmates from its state prisons to ease overcrowding. The Court dismissed the appeals in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-416.htm">Schwarzenegger v. Plata</a> and <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-553.htm">California State Republican Legislator Intervenors v. Plata</a> [dockets] for lack of jurisdiction but noted &quot;that a further order has been entered in this case, but that order is not the subject of these appeals. It is also noted that the district court has stayed its further order pending review by this Court.&quot; Last week, a panel of federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judges-approve-california-plan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new prison reduction plan, but stayed the order pending Supreme Court action.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/">Iraq Inquiry</a> [official website] released a 2002 <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/42845/goldsmith-hoon-letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday from former UK attorney general <a href="http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=4f6286dc-73f9-4bed-a90f-2a6923a19f77">Peter Goldsmith</a> [professional profile] to former secretary of defense <a href="http://www.geoffhoonmp.co.uk/biog/">Geoffrey Hoon</a> [personal profile] in which Goldsmith warned the Cabinet that the Iraq invasion was not supported by international law. The letter stated that Goldsmith was having &quot;considerable difficulty&quot; supporting a legal foundation for the Iraq invasion:<br /><blockquote><br />As you are aware, the Law Officers&#39; opinion has not been sought on the legality of possible action and I have not therefore offered any views on the legal position. The clarity of your statement and the apparently authoritative way it was produced puts me however in a difficult position. I see considerable difficulties in being satisfied that military action would be justified on the basis of self defence. In particular I am not aware of the existence of material indicating the existence of an imminent threat from Iraq of the sort which would justify military action without support of a Security Council ... authorisation.<br /></blockquote><br />In response, Hoon wrote in a <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/42842/hoon-goldsmith-letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Goldsmith that Hoon&#39;s statements were being misconstrued, and clarified by stating that military action would be warranted &quot;in principle&quot; if weapons of mass destruction were found in Saddam Hussein&#39;s possession. Hoon stated in the letter, &quot;I do not think that my statements curtail your ability to offer an opinion on  the legal position in due course. As you say, we will need to satisfy  ourselves that this threat exists should we want to justify legal action on  the basis of self-defence.&quot; Hoon will be questioned by the Iraq Inquiry on Tuesday concerning his role in the invasion. He will be the first former minister to appear before the inquiry, following a string of military  leaders, advisers and officials.<br /><br />Former UK prime minister <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/blair.php">news archive</a>] is also facing criticism after the Inquiry released a letter from Goldsmith written to Blair in July 2002, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-uk-pm-blair-was-warned-iraq.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] Blair that the planned invasion of Iraq could be illegal. The letter laid out the reasons that Goldsmith believed the Iraq invasion might be illegal, including that an invasion could not be based on &quot;regime change&quot; alone. The existence of this letter will increase the difficulty for Blair to use a good-faith defense against charges that he knowingly led the country into an illegal invasion. Blair is scheduled to testify before the Inquiry next week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-crm-048.html">announced</a> [press release] on Tuesday that 22 individuals were <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pr/press_releases/month_index.html?201001">indicted</a> [materials] for violating federal bribery laws in an effort to obtain foreign business contracts. An undercover operation conducted by the FBI found violations of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/statute.html">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> (FCPA) [text], which prohibits the bribing of foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining business. The defendants believed they were dealing with an agent representing an African minister of defense, and they agreed to offer a commission in order to secure part of a $15 million military contract. The indictment also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1920007620100119?type=marketsNews">includes</a> [Reuters report] conspiracy to commit money laundering charges through the sale of goods such as guns and armor. Several corporate executives are among those indicted, including the current and former CEOs of <a href="http://www.protectiveproductsofamerica.com/index.php">Protective Products of America</a> and the VP of Sales for <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&content=11001">Smith &amp; Wesson</a> [corporate websites]. Smith &amp; Wesson issued a <a href="http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1376871&highlight=">statement</a> [press release] following the indictment denying any knowledge of their employee&#39;s involvement and promising to cooperate with the government as the investigation proceeds. <br /><br />The indictment was the largest ever under the FCPA. In August, former congressman <a href="http://baic.house.gov/member-profiles/profile.html?intID=98">William Jefferson</a> (D-LA) [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=William+Jefferson">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/former-congressman-convicted-on-bribery.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 11 counts of public corruption under the FCPA. In November 2007, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chevron-settles-sec-charges-in-oil-for.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a $30 million settlement with <a href="http://www.chevron.com/">Chevron</a> [corporate website] over FCPA charges in connection with the company&#39;s involvement in a scheme to exchange illegal payments to Iraqi officials under the now-defunct UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/">Oil-for-Food program</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/oilforfood.php">news archive</a>]. Also in 2007, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/oil-drilling-companies-settle-fcpa.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] three drilling companies under the FCPA for paying Nigerian officials in order to obtain expedited clearance through customs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine signed the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/S0500/119_I1.PDF">&quot;Compassionate Use of Medical Marijuana&quot; bill</a> [text, PDF] on his last full day in office Monday, legalizing the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The bill allows doctors to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/nyregion/12marijuana.html">prescribe marijuana</a> [NYT report] to patients with chronic illnesses such as cancer, AIDS, Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis, which will be distributed through state-monitored dispensaries. Backers of the legislation have <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/18/NJ-medical-pot-bill-signed-into-law/UPI-24921263870984/">described</a> [UPI report] the bill as the toughest medical marijuana law passed in the US. The measure limits use of medical marijuana to specific types of chronic illness and forbids users to grown their own marijuana or use it in public. The New Jersey legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-legislature-approves-medical.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] last week, and Corzine signed the bill as one of his last acts as governor. Republican <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/about/">Chris Christie</a> [official website] was sworn in as New Jersey&#39;s governor on Tuesday.<br /><br />This legislation makes New Jersey the fourteenth US state to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/medicalmarijuanaact.pdf">expansion</a> [proposed legislation, PDF] of the state&#39;s existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine became the fifth state to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=8859286">allow dispensaries</a> [ABC News report], following California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. In October, US Attorney General Eric Holder issued <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. Ending such raids was one of President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/politics/primarysource/2007/08/all_democratic.html">campaign promises</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span> report], a view that differed sharply from the policy of the Bush administration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Spanish foreign ministry official confirmed Monday that Spain will be accepting two detainees currently being held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. One of the detainees is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011801718.html">said to be</a> [AP report] of Yemeni origin, while the nationality of the other was not released. Spanish <a href="http://www.maec.es/en/MenuPpal/Ministerio/ElMinistro/Paginas/Bibliografia.aspx">Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/11/world/AP-EU-Spain-Guantanamo.html">said</a> [AP report] last week that an agreement between Spain and the US was close to completion in anticipation of the transfer. The detainees are expected to be transferred to Spain over the next few weeks. Spain is the most recent in a string of countries worldwide that have agreed to take in detainees from Guantanamo Bay, as the US administration attempts to empty the facility. Last month, Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-to-accept-uzbek-guantanamo.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to take one Uzbek detainee, and has expressed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-warns-switzerland-against.php">willingness</a> [JURIST report] to take two more. Also last month, 12 more detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">transferred</a> to their home governments, and detainees were transferred to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to.php">Kuwait</a>, and several <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">European countries</a> [JURIST reports].<br /><br />The transfer to Spain comes at the request of the Obama administration, which initially <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20090618-us-asks-spain-take-four-guantanamo-inmates-prison-terrorism-">requested</a> [France 24 report] that Spain take as many as four detainees last June as part of the administration&#39;s plan to close the facility. Closure was initially due by January 22, 2010, but President Obama recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/us/19gitmo.html?_r=1">confirmed</a> [NYT report] that this deadline would not be met. The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/jmb-delay-in-guantanamo-closure-due-to.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] blaming missteps by the Obama administration for the delay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenya&#39;s Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) decided Tuesday not to grant women equal marriage rights to men in the new constitution. References to civil society, religious groups, and rights of gays were also <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/845752/-/vpd9vu/-/">omitted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Nation</span> report] as the PSC reviewed recommendations from the Committee of Experts and decided which to include. The PSC, which is composed of members of parliament, will decide between a <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=61996">presidential or a parliamentary system</a> [KBC report] for Kenya, a highly political question. The PSC is expected to spend the rest of the week <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/Anxiety-as-Kenyan-MPs-retreat-7149.html">debating the issues</a> [Capital FM report] and next week drafting the new constitution. <br /><br />The first draft of the constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/kenya-committee-unveils-new-draft.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] in November. The changes are intended to reduce the widespread injustice throughout the country, and specifically address issues that led to violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">2007 presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October, former UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/annan.php">news archive</a>] called for constitutional reform in Kenya before the next electoral cycle begins in 15 months. In 2007, tens of thousands of protesters took to Kenya&#39;s streets accusing <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] of election fraud after early opinion polls suggested rival <a href="http://www.raila07.com/">Raila Odinga</a> [campaign website] was in the lead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">Spanish High Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Monday ordered the extradition of pilot Julio Alberto Poch so that he may be tried in Argentina for his alleged role in the nation&#39;s 1976-83 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">&quot;Dirty War&quot;</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>]. Poch was a navy officer at Argentina&#39;s <a href="http://www.memoriaabierta.org.ar/camino_al_museo3.php">Naval Mechanics School</a> [backgrounder, in Spanish], one of the most notorious detention centers of the military dictatorship, and is believed to have piloted flights, known as &quot;death flights,&quot; which were used to dump the military junta&#39;s political opponents into the Plata river and the Atlantic Ocean. Poch holds dual Dutch and Argentine citizenship, which had protected him from earlier attempts at <a href="http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=238876">extradition</a> [ABC report, Spanish], but he was arrested and imprisoned last September when he landed in Valencia while en route to the Netherlands. The Spanish court found that there are adequate measures in place to guarantee that Poch will receive a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8466280.stm">fair trial</a> [BBC report] in Argentina. Poch continues to deny the charges against him but has accepted extradition.<br /><br />Last month, an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/argentina-court-sentences-former-judge.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former judge Victor Brusa to 21 years in prison for crimes against humanity during the country&#39;s Dirty War. The Federal Court of Santa Fe found Brusa guilty of eight counts of crimes against humanity in his capacity as a judicial officer during the dictatorship. The court also sentenced five former police officers to between 19 and 23 years in prison for their roles in kidnapping and torture. Brusa was arrested in 2005 after Argentina&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">struck down amnesty laws</a> [JURIST report] adopted in the 1980s to deter military insurrection against the democratic government, prompting the government to reopen hundreds of human rights cases. During the Dirty War, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or &quot;disappeared&quot; in a government-sponsored campaign against suspected dissidents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The British Government <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease180110a.htm">announced</a> [press release] Monday plans for a new scheme to compensate victims of terrorist attacks abroad. <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/organisation/ministers1/alan-johnson/">Home Secretary Alan Johnson</a> [official profile] introduced the <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200607/ldbills/023/2007023.pdf">Victims of Overseas Terrorism Compensation Scheme</a> [text, PDF] as part of the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/crimeandsecurity.html">Crime and Security Bill</a> [materials] that is currently before Parliament. The scheme will be limited to British nationals who sustain any injury from an act of terrorism occurring outside the United Kingdom after January 1, 2002. <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/straw.htm">Justice Secretary Jack Straw</a> [official profile] said:<br /><blockquote><br />Terrorism is intended as a political statement and an attack on society as a whole. Therefore it is right that, as a tangible expression of sympathy, society should compensate the victims of terrorist attacks abroad in recognition of the injuries suffered&#8230; Although we will never be able to compensate fully the trauma victims of terrorism experience, we hope the new scheme will provide some much needed relief and recognition that victims and their loved ones go through.<br /></blockquote><br />Complete details of the plan have not yet been released.<br /><br />The Victims of Overseas Terrorism Compensation Scheme broadly mirrors the country&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cica.gov.uk/en-gb/">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</a> (CICA) [official website] <a href="http://www.cica.gov.uk/Documents/publications/Criminal%20Injuries%20Compensation%20Scheme%202008.pdf">scheme</a> [text, PDF], which provides compensation for injuries, loss of earnings, death of a loved one, and expenses to Britons who are blameless victims of violent crimes occuring within the UK. The UK <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/first-compensation-payments-made-to.php">compensated victims</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2005/london_explosions/default.stm">London bombings</a> [BBC report] in 2005 via the CICA compensation scheme. Victims were <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/families-victims-of-london-bombings.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] between of &pound;11,000 ($19,543 USD) with a maximum payout total of &pound;500,000 ($888,542 USD). Following the US <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] established a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/victimcompensation/">Victim Compensation Fund</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/911-victim-compensation-report.php">made more than 5,000 payments</a> [JURIST report] to survivors and families of victims ranging from $250,000 to over $8 million.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK-based human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2010_01_19_homicides_guantanamo_bay">statement</a> [text] Tuesday suggesting that the Obama administration has suppressed information relating to the investigation of <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">three 2006 Guantanamo Bay suicides</a> [JURIST report] and urging further inquiries. The statement comes in response to an <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/hbc-90006368">article</a> [text] for an upcoming issue of <a href="http://harpers.org/"><em>Harper&#39;s Magazine</em></a> [media website], in which former guards at the prison indicate that the three prisoners experienced intense interrogations in a remote area of the base just hours before the apparent suicide. According to the article, military personnel were instructed by a commanding officer that the media would be told that the deaths were suicides. The Obama administration issued a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60I52Q20100119">statement</a> [Reuters report] indicating that it took the matter seriously and found no evidence of wrongdoing during its investigation. A 2008 investigation conducted by the US <a href="http://www.ncis.navy.mil/index.asp">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> (NCIS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/guantanamo-detainees-desired-martyrdom.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that the cause of death was suicide.<br /><br />In June, another Yemeni Guantanamo detainee was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/yemeni-guantanamo-detainee-dies-of.php">pronounced dead</a> [JURIST report] after apparently committing suicide. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] called for a &quot;full and transparent investigation&quot; into the death. Military officials said that the three 2006 detainees, who hanged themselves using nooses made from sheets and clothes, had participated in hunger strikes and were among those who had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-army-general-confirms-force-feeding.php">force-fed</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said the deaths &quot;are the tragic results of years of arbitrary and indefinite detention&quot; and should serve as &quot;an indictment on [Guantanamo&#39;s] deteriorating human rights record.&quot; In 2006, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] rejected a demand by Amnesty International for an independent investigation into the suicides.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] Local police struggled to maintain law and order in Haiti while awaiting the deployment of more US troops on Monday, as looting and vigilantism rose among increasingly desperate and frustrated survivors of the earthquake that struck the country last week. The troops arriving Monday are part of a 5,700-strong US contingent <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/haiti/6990801/Haiti-earthquake-gunshots-and-panic-as-locals-fight-back-against-looters.html">expected to arrive</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] by the end of the week to assist the 3,000 police and international peacekeepers deployed to secure the airport, port, and main buildings. Incidents of looting and violence <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/world/americas/19haiti.html?ref=global-home">have been on the rise</a> [NYT report], and the reported lynching of one suspected looter along with shootings Sunday have led to an increase in the number of UN peacekeepers patrolling the streets. The country's legal system and government are <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100118-haiti-earthquake-political-vacuum-perrine-buleon-reconstruction-state-preval">largely non-operational</a> [France 24 report] in the wake of the disaster. More than 100 US troops <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/haitian_quake_victims_growing_angry_umtAiKwZUjSE5VnIC9wFWI">landed</a> [<em>New York Post</em> report] in Haiti on Friday, distributing supplies to survivors. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/index.shtml">UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti</a> [official website] has said that up to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/documents/sg_remarks_15012010.pdf">50% of buildings</a> [statement, PDF] have been destroyed or damaged, including the presidential palace, the UN Mission headquarters, and the main prison, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-inmates-escape-collapsed-prison.php">allowing nearly 4,000 inmates to escape</a> [JURIST report].

On January 12, a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php">7.0 magnitude earthquake</a> [USGS backgrounder] caused massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti. Haitian government officials <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/01/201011831019984373.html">estimate</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] the death toll to be as high as 100,000 to 200,000. More than 70,000 bodies have been buried since the earthquake hit. Haitian nationals already present in the US on January 12 have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">granted Temporary Protected Status</a> [JURIST report] and will be allowed to continue living and working in the US for the next 18 months regardless of their immigration status.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Arguments began Monday before Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court in the latest appeal by Myanmar opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. Suu Kyi&#39;s appeal contests an 18-month <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">extension to her house arrest</a> [JURIST report] that was imposed by a lower court in August. Suu Kyi&#39;s lawyer, Nyan Win, has stated that the extension to Suu Kyi&#39;s arrest is based on provisions of the now-defunct 1974 constitution. Suu Kyi&#39;s detention to her compound in Yangon will prohibit her from competing in this year&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8464783.stm">elections</a> [BBC report] as a member of her <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [official website] party. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in Suu Kyi&#39;s case soon. <br /><br />The timing of Suu Kyi&#39;s trial coincides with government action against US citizen <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/NYINYI.php">Nyi Nyi Aung</a> [Freedom Now profile], who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-court-charges-us-citizen-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in early January with forgery and violating Myanmar&#39;s foreign currency act. Suu Kyi&#39;s hearing date was scheduled the same day Aung was charged. The Myanmar Supreme Court agreed to hear Suu Kyi&#39;s case in December after an unsuccessful October <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/myanmar-court-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Divisional Court in Rangoon. In addition to rejecting the appeal, the lower court ruled that Suu Kyi herself would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/myanmar-court-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] from attending the proceedings. Suu Kyi, who has been in prison or under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, was found to have violated the military junta&#39;s state security laws after <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/suu-kyi-to-appeal-conviction-for.php">John Yettaw</a> [JURIST report], an uninvited American, swam across a lake to her home in May 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_01-19-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Tuesday in two cases. In the combined cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-240.pdf">Mac&#39;s Shell Service, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products Co.</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-student-loan.php">report</a>] and <u>Shell Oil Products Co. v. Mac&#39;s Shell Service, Inc.</u>, the Court heard arguments on whether a service station operator can bring a constructive termination action under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_55_20_I.html">Petroleum Marketing Practices Act</a> [15 USC &sect; 2801-2806 text] when the operator continues to run the franchise with the same trademark, fuel, and premises. Additionally, the Court will decide on the requirements for constructive non-renewal of a franchise-franchisee agreement under the act. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/05-2771-01A.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court ruling that a franchise may recover for constructive termination even if it continues to use the same trademark, fuel, and premises. The First Circuit additionally reversed the district ruling on constructive non-renewal of an agreement, holding that a franchisee faced with an unlawful lease has to either sign the lease and forgo any potential actions under the act or refuse to sign and bring a challenge to it after receiving a notice of non-renewal. Counsel for Shell Oil argued:<blockquote>Because the term &quot;terminate,&quot; at the very least, requires an end, we and the United States agree that the First Circuit erred in upholding the so-called constructive termination, where the dealers continued to receive each element of the statutory franchise - that is the premises, the trademark, and fuel -</blockquote>Counsel for Mac&#39;s argued:<blockquote>In this case the jury determined that Shell and Motiva engaged in conduct designed - prohibited by the PMPA when they raised rent to force dealers out of business and convert their stations to direct operations. Nevertheless, Shell and Motiva argue that conduct designed to force the dealers out of business is insufficient to invoke statutory protection because the dealers were not deprived of any of the statutory elements of the franchise and they remained in business for some period following the rental increase.<br /><br />If accepted, the practical effect of Shell and Motiva&#39;s position will allow franchisors to circumvent the PMPA and terminate franchises at any time, at any reason, by simply increasing the burden on their operations.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1214.pdf">Granite Rock Co. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-international-child.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether a federal court has jurisdiction to determine whether a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was formed when it is disputed whether any binding contract exists, but no party makes an independent challenge to the arbitration clause apart from claiming it is inoperative before the contract is established. The court also heard arguments on whether Section 301(a) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/usc_sup_01_29_10_7.html">Labor Management Relations Act</a> (LMRA) [text], which generally preempts otherwise available state law causes of action, provides a cause of action against a third-party international union that is not a direct signatory to the collective bargaining agreement. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/10/21/0715040.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court&#39;s dismissal of a claim against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) for tortious interference with a collective bargaining agreement between Granite Rock and Local Union 287. Counsel for the petitioner argued, &quot;the concept that we are advancing is the plain language of the statute. Violation of a contract is right at the heart of this suit. You have for 150 years jurisprudence where in enforcing contracts, which is the central mission of the statute.&quot; Counsel for the IBT argued:<blockquote>that allowing the tort action as, Granite Rock is urging, would work a big change in the structure that Congress has established by which it has decided that major issues of labor law, such as the weapons - economic weapons that parties can use, should be decided by Congress through statute and by the National Labor Relations Board through the application of the statute.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An appeals court in Malaysia ruled on Tuesday that the country&#39;s ban on sodomy is constitutional. The court made the <a href="http://news.malaysia.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3797679">ruling</a> [AFP report] while considering the appeal of Abdul Rahim Abdul Rahaman, who was convicted of sodomizing a 14-year-old boy and sentenced to 60 years imprisonment. Abdul Rahim claimed the intercourse with the boy was consensual, but the court said that was irrelevant, rejecting arguments that the ban violates the <a href="http://www.pogar.org/publications/other/constitutions/malaysia-e.pdf">Malaysian Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits discrimination.<br /><br />This ruling could have implications for the trial of Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Anwar+Ibrahim">news archives</a>], who is accused of sodomizing his former aide, Mohd Saiful Bukhari, in 2008. Anwar has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] and contends that the charge is part of a government conspiracy to undermine his political agenda. Anwar&#39;s counsel <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/malaysia-high-court-refuses-to-dismiss.php">sought unsuccessfully</a> [JURIST report] to have the case thrown out last month. This is the second sodomy charge against Anwar in the past 11 years. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s deputy prime minister until he was fired in 1998 following sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the expiration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. The <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=467798">trial date</a> [Bernama report] for this second charge of sodomy against Anwar has been set for January 25. If convicted, Anwar faces up to 20 years in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The federal trial of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=aafia+siddiqui">Aafia Siddiqui</a> [JURIST news archive], a Pakistani woman with alleged ties to al Qaeda, began Tuesday in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Siddiqui is <a href="http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/US_v_AafiaSiddiqui_complaint.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] with assault and the attempted murder of a US officer after allegedly opening fire on agents at the Afghan detention facility where she was being held in July 2008. As soon as her trial began, Siddiqui became agitated and started screaming that she was innocent, causing her to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/20/AR2010012000466.html">removed from the courtroom</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report]. Originally detained in Afghanistan because she was allegedly in possession of explosive chemicals and lists of New York City targets, Siddiqui has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8467832.stm">denied</a> [BBC report] that she is part of any al Qaeda terrorist plot.  <br /><br />Siddiqui underwent a psychiatric evaluation and was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-judge-rules-pakistan-woman.php">judged fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in July. Siddiqui, who was extradited to the US in August of 2008, was shot in the abdomen during the July skirmish leading to her charges. She has since refused proper medical care as well as communication with her legal counsel. Siddiqui&#39;s family has insisted that she is not an al Qaeda agent and that the FBI has publicized misleading information about her. They say that Siddiqui, a former student at Brandeis University and MIT in Boston, may have been a victim of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] after she vanished from Karachi, Pakistan in 2003. Defense lawyers have alleged that Siddiqui may have been wrongly detained and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/04/AR2008090402245.html">tortured</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> report] at Bagram air base in Afghanistan. Siddiqui was taken into custody in July 2008 after she was found loitering outside a provincial governor&#39;s compound with suspicious items in her handbag.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-9156.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-9156">Wood v. Allen</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in_04.php">report</a>] that a state court reasonably concluded that, during the sentencing phase of a capital case, the defense attorney&#39;s failure to present the defendant&#39;s impaired mental functioning did not constitute ineffective counsel. The Court affirmed the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200616412.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, finding it had correctly applied the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [text, PDF] to the review the state court decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor concluded:<br /><blockquote><br />We hold simply that, even under petitioner&#39;s reading of &sect; 2254(d)(2) [of the AEDPA], the state court&#39;s conclusion that Wood&#39;s counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determination of the facts.<br /></blockquote><br />The Court did not reach the question of how AEDPA &sect; 2254(e)(1), which provides that the petitioner has the burden of challenging a state court&#39;s findings of facts by clear and convincing evidence, applies in challenges to a state court&#39;s factual determinations under &sect; 2254(d)(2). Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy.<br /><br />The defendant, Holly Wood, broke into his ex-girlfriend&#39;s home in 1993, shooting and killing her. Wood was convicted on capital murder charges and sentenced to death. After his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court, Wood petitioned for federal <em>habeas</em> relief. Wood argued that his counsel&#39;s failure to investigate and present mitigation evidence of his mental deficiencies during the penalty phase constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court granted <em>habeas</em> relief, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal employee <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/golinskicomplaint.pdf ">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday against the federal government seeking to add her same-sex spouse to her family health insurance plan. <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website] brought the suit in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] on behalf of Karen Golinski, a federal court employee who was married in California during the six-month period when <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] licenses were granted under state law. Golinski is seeking an injunction against the <a href="http://www.opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM) [official website], which refuses to enroll her same-sex spouse, citing the 1998 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. OPM refuses despite multiple <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-orders-health-benefits.php">orders</a> [JURIST report] to do so, issued after an employment dispute resolution (EDR) hearing by the chief judge of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], Alex Kozinski. Golinski&#39;s complaint argues that Kozinski&#39;s orders should be binding because, &quot;as to judicial employees, the separation of powers doctrine requires that an EDR tribunal&#39;s reasonable interpretation of the law take precedence over that of any office or agency of the executive.&quot; OPM did not appeal the judge&#39;s order but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/statement_from_elaine_kaplan_opm.pdf">issued a press release</a> [text, PDF] stating that it is not obligated to follow them because the chief judge, &quot;was acting as an administrative official in this matter, reacting to the concerns of an employee of the judiciary. He was not acting as a federal judge in a court case.&quot;<br /><br />In November, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-moves-to-dismiss-massachusetts-ag.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a federal <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Cago/docs/press/2009_07_08_doma_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the DOMA. The suit was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-to-dismiss-defense-of.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] in July by Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagomodulechunk&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago&b=terminalcontent&f=our_organization_aboutmartha&csid=Cago">Attorney General Martha Coakley</a> [official profile] and challenges the DOMA on constitutional grounds. In September, the government <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-to-dismiss-defense-of.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a similar lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy website] on behalf of a group of plaintiffs who are or have been married under Massachusetts state&#39;s same-sex marriage law. Also in September, 90 members of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-repeal.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.3567:">bill</a> [HR 3567 text] to repeal the DOMA, which was signed by former president Bill Clinton in 1996. DOMA refuses federal marriage benefits to same-sex couples, including social security, tax laws, and immigration rights, and defines marriage as between a man and a woman.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Italian Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] approved a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34502.htm">bill</a> [S 1880 materials, in Italian] Wednesday that aims to shorten the trial and appeals process by putting strict time limits on its duration. The legislation would limit the three stages of a case - trial, initial appeal, and final appeal - to between 6.5 and 10 years depending on the crime, and cases that exceed the time limit would end in an automatic acquittal of the defendant. Because of the bill&#39;s retroactive effect, two pending corruption cases against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] would be automatically dismissed. Members of Berlusconi&#39;s center-right coalition defended the bill as a way to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6995720.ece">speed up</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report] the slow Italian justice system while his critics called it an &quot;ad personam&quot; bill, passed by his allies to help Berlusconi with his <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d7042fe-05e7-11df-8c97-00144feabdc0.html">legal troubles</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</span> report]. The bill would become law if it is approved by the <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> and signed by <a href="http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official websites, in Italian].<br /><br />In October, the Italian <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/index.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/italy-high-court-strikes-down-immunity.php">struck down a 2008 law granting immunity</a> [JURIST report] to Berlusconi and four others, finding it unconstitutional. Last week, Italian judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-court-again-postpones-berlusconi.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi&#39;s corruption trial at his lawyers&#39; request. He is charged with paying his British lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive] to provide false testimony in two trials involving Berlusconi&#39;s broadcast company, <a href="http://www.gruppomediaset.it/indexgruppo.jsp?lang=EN">Mediaset</a> [official website, in Italian]. Berlusconi&#39;s tax fraud trial has also been <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-court-adjourns-berlusconi-tax.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report]. Berlusconi has been previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a> [JURIST reports], and has had some other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Federal courts provide an effective venue for prosecuting terror suspects, securing convictions in 89 percent of cases since 2001, according to a <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/publications/TTRCFinalJan14.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/publications/TTRCHighlightsSept25th.pdf">report highlights</a>, PDF] released Wednesday by New York University&#39;s <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/index.cfm">Center on Law and Security</a> [official website]. The report found that in recent years, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has prosecuted fewer high-profile terror defendants, choosing instead to indict those it is more likely to convict. Although the DOJ has used a number of controversial techniques, including relying on statutes that may be unconstitutionally broad, actions that some say amount to entrapment, reliance on confidential information that is not made public, and prolonged detention, the report found that most of these or similar practices do not differ greatly from tactics used in drug dealing and organized crime cases. The report concluded:<br /><blockquote><br />The trend lines demonstrate convincingly that federal courts are capable of trying alleged terrorists and securing high rates of conviction. While we can only assess the cases that have been brought, federal prosecution has demonstrably become a powerful tool in many hundreds of cases, not only for incapacitating terrorists but also for intelligence gathering. Much of the government&#8217;s knowledge of terrorist groups has come from testimony and evidence produced in grand jury investigations, including information provided by cooperators, and in the resulting trials.<br /></blockquote><br />According to the report, &quot;the overwhelming evidence suggests that the structures and procedures, as well as the substantive precedents, provide a strong and effective system of justice for alleged crimes of terrorism.&quot;<br /><br />Last week, the Associated Press reported that the Obama administration is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-considering-dc-trial-for-guantanamo.php">considering trying</a> [JURIST report] Riduan Isamuddin, the suspected planner of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali Nightclub Bombing</a> [BBC backgrounder], in a federal court in Washington, DC. Earlier this month, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-guantanamo-detainee-referred-to.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsobaidullah.html">Obaidullah</a> [DOD backgrounder] would be tried in a military prosecution, becoming the sixth detainee ordered prosecuted in this way since President Barack Obama ordered a review of the process last year. In November, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-defends-911-federal-trials.php">appeared before Congress</a> to defend the Obama administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] to five alleged 9/11 conspirators in federal courts in New York and Virginia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-911.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-911">Kucana v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on_10.php">report</a>] that a federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001252----000-.html">statute</a> [8 USC &sect; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) text] gives federal courts jurisdiction to review rulings on motions to reopen decisions by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [DOJ backgrounder]. &sect; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) states that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the attorney general &quot;the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.&quot; The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/N00NJ7M3.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that it lacked jurisdiction to review the petitioner&#39;s claim. In reversing that decision, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription of judicial review stated in &sect;1252(a)(2)(B) applies not only to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute, but also to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation. We hold that the key words &quot;specified under this subchapter&quot; refer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We so rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial review of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the text and context of &sect;1252(a)(2)(B), and the history of therelevant statutory provisions. We take account, as well, of the &quot;presumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to] allow judicial review of administrative action.&quot; Separation-of-powers concerns, more-over, caution us against reading legislation, absent clear statement, to place in executive hands authority to remove cases from the Judiciary&#39;s domain.<br /></blockquote><br />The respondent, the US government also argued in support of the petitioner that the federal court had jurisdiction to review the claim. Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.<br /><br />The petitioner, Albanian citizen Agron Kucana, entered the US in 1995 on a work visa, remaining after it expired. He applied for asylum in 1996, alleging that he would be persecuted for his political beliefs if returned to Albania. When he failed to attend his asylum hearing, the immigration judge immediately ordered his removal. Kucana filed two motions to reopen his removal proceedings, but those motions were rejected by the immigration judge and the BIA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Vietnamese court on Wednesday convicted four democracy activists of subversion. After a one-day trial, prominent human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8470110.stm">sentenced to five years</a> [BBC report] in prison.

The defendants were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60J38G20100120">accused</a> [Reuters report] of activities aimed at ending Vietnam&#39;s communist rule. Dinh, the best known of the defendants, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/world/asia/21vietnam.html">admitted</a> [NYT report] to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democratic Party of Vietnam.<br /><br />Last month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&key=79425&sessionId=43334029&skin=hudoc-en&attachment=true">dismissed</a> [judgment, DOC; in French] a suit against Italy by Palestinian immigrants alleging illegal expulsion from the country. In a <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=7&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=43333802&skin=hudoc-pr-en">statement</a> [press release] explaining its decision, the court questioned the existence of at least 34 of the 84 immigrants, and was unable to locate 57 of the individuals. Regarding the 14 individuals who were known to have been expelled to Libya, the court said, &quot;the expulsion order against each one of them had been individually endorsed by a district court following a hearing held in the presence of a lawyer and an interpreter.&quot; Reaction to the news was <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2010/01/19/visualizza_new.html_1675616215.html">mixed</a> [ANSA report], with some hailing the result as a showing that the original immigration by the individuals was illegal, and others expressing concern over a culture of insensitivity towards the suffering of others.<br /><br />Illegal immigration is a growing problem in Italy, where about 36,000 illegal immigrants arrived by boat in 2008. Earlier this month, a group of African immigrants was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-authorities-evacuate-african.php">evacuated</a> [JURIST report] from the town of Rosarno after violence was directed towards migrant farm workers there. In August, rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/rights-groups-criticize-italy-for.php">criticized Italy</a> [JURIST report] for returning a suspected terrorist to Tunisia, disregarding obligations imposed by the ECHR. In July, the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/italy-senate-passes-anti-illegal.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] that would criminalize illegal immigration with a fine of between 5,000 and 10,000 euros and up to 6 months detention before deportation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] signed an order Wednesday authorizing two previously excluded Muslim scholars who strongly criticized US foreign policy to enter the country. During the Bush administration, the US government barred professors <a href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/staff/iw/tramadan.html">Tariq Ramadan</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22tariq+ramadan%22">news archive</a>] of Oxford University and <a href="http://www.ukzn.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?10,24,8,49">Adam Habib</a> [academic profile] of the University of Johannesburg from entering the country, claiming both had ties to terrorism. Clinton said Wednesday that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gtsXSSms2Fi2TxF36YH6fNMPTtGQ">neither posed a security threat</a> [AFP report]. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which represented both professors in separate lawsuits seeking to have the men admitted into the US, released a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/state-department-ends-unconstitutional-exclusion-blacklisted-scholars-us">statement</a> [press release] approving the decision. ACLU Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer applauded the decision as &quot;a welcome sign that the Obama administration is committed to facilitating, rather than obstructing, the exchange of ideas across international borders.&quot; Ramadan <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/academy-religion-v-napolitano-plaintiff-statements-response-secretary-clintons-ord">stated</a> [press release], &quot;I am very happy and hopeful that I will be able to visit the United States very soon and to once again engage in an open, critical and constructive dialogue with American scholars and intellectuals.&quot; Habib <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/american-sociological-association-v-clinton-plaintiff-statements-response-secretar">called the decision</a> [press release] &quot;a victory for democracy around the world.&quot; A status conference for Ramadan&#39;s case was held Wednesday afternoon in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] to determine how the case should proceed in light of Clinton&#39;s order. Both professors must still go through the standard visa application process before they can enter the US.<br /><br />In July, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/second-circuit-overturns-muslim-scholar.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the district court had improperly granted summary judgment to the government in its decision to deny Ramadan&#39;s visa application. The government alleged that Ramadan, who had been invited to teach at Notre Dame, provided material support to a terrorist organization by donating to a charity with some financial ties to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aclu-challenges-patriot-act-provision.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 on behalf of the <a href="http://www.aarweb.org/">American Academy of Religion</a>, the <a href="http://www.aaup.org/aaup">American Association of University Professors</a>, and the <a href="http://www.pen.org/">PEN American Center</a> [organization websites]. The ACLU challenged the exclusion on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] grounds. In 2008, the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-court-rules-it-may-review-us.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the court could review the US Consulate in South Africa&#39;s decision to deny Habib&#39;s visa application.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] on Wednesday filed an <a href="/pdf/karadzic11910.pdf">appeal</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] challenging the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icty-to-appoint-counsel-for-karadzic.php">imposition of a court-appointed lawyer</a> [JURIST report]. Karadzic argued that the trial court erred by not allowing him to choose standby counsel in violation of his right to &quot;legal assistance of his own choosing&quot; under Article 21(4)(d) of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf">Statute</a> of the ICTY and the Appeals Chamber <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/acdec/en/061208e.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] in <u>Prosecutor v. Seselj</u>. Karadzic alleged that by not removing the court-appointed counsel, the trial chamber sanctioned the &quot;unreasonable and arbitrary selection procedure which resulted in the exclusion of all lawyers from the Balkans&quot; and the &quot;imposition of a lawyer on the accused that the accused did not want and cannot trust.&quot;<br /><br />Last month the Trial Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icty-rejects-karadzic-challenge-to.php">rejected</a> Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/karadzic-files-motion-challenging.php">motion</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the legitimacy of the court. In November, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icty-rejects-karadzic-attempt-to-remove.php">denied a motion</a> filed by Karadzic requesting appellate review of the court&#39;s decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icty-to-appoint-counsel-for-karadzic.php">assign standby counsel</a> [JURIST reports]. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/jmb-icty-resumes-karadzic-war-crimes.php">began</a> Karadzic&#39;s trial <em>in absentia</em> in October after Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-adjourns-karadzic-war-crimes-trial.php">failed to appear</a> [JURIST reports] in court. Karadzic had announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/karadzic-threatens-boycott-of-icty-war.php">planned to boycott</a> [JURIST report] his trial because he had not been given adequate time to prepare a defense. The ICTY has also repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-appeals-chamber-upholds-rejection.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Karadzic&#39;s argument that he should be immune from trial based on an alleged agreement with former UN ambassador Richard Holbrooke. Karadzic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide and murder, for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_bosnia.html">Bosnian genocide</a> [PPU backgrounder]. In June, the ICTY said that Karadzic&#39;s trial was expected to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icty-sets-karadzic-trial-date-for.php">conclude in early 2012</a> [JURIST report]. His trial is planned to be the tribunal&#39;s last.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22206">announced</a> [statement] the country&#39;s plans for enhanced airport security measures and anti-terrorism efforts to the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">House of Commons</a> [official website] on Wednesday. The new security provisions include increasing intelligence information-sharing with foreign agencies and extending the Home Office Watchlist to include both a no-fly list and a list of individuals subject to enhanced security screenings in airports. The enhanced screenings will include explosive trace testing, use of dogs and new body scanners. Brown said:<br /><blockquote><br />The action we are taking to counter terrorism at its source in the Afghanistan Pakistan region and elsewhere is a central part of our wider counter-terrorist strategy, and all our actions which we will update regularly are founded on what is and must be the first and most important duty of government: the protection and security of the British people.<br /></blockquote><br />In addition, Brown announced UK flights to and from Yemen will be suspended until further security measures can be enforced.<br /><br />The proposed UK security measures are in response to the failed US bombing attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. Earlier this month, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] stricter airline security measures in response to the failed attack. Obama pledged to improve airline passenger security, calling the attempted bombing &quot;a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence.&quot; Obama said that the US government had sufficient information to uncover the plot, but that &quot;our intelligence community failed to connect those dots.&quot; Abdulmutallab has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">plea of not guilty</a> [JURIST report] has been entered on his behalf.

The ordinance granted <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] and 8,000 other government officials immunity from charges including corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism between January 1986, and October 1999. A special 17-member panel of court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">unanimously ruled the NRO unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] in December, paving the way for corruption charges to be brought against Zardari. Zardari is immune from prosecution while in office, but challenges to his eligibility as a presidential candidate are expected.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian Federal Court on Wednesday postponed the sodomy trial of opposition leader <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/inner.asp?z=3">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] until February 2 pending their decision on his access to prosecution evidence. Anwar&#39;s lawyers appealed to the Federal Court to enforce an earlier <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=467798">High Court order</a> [Bernama report] granting access to evidence including recorded witness statements and medical reports. Chief Judge of Malaya Tan Sri Arifin Zakaria and two Federal Court judges <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=469750">failed to reach a decision</a> [Bernama report] on the appeal and have deferred their decision until January 29. Anwar&#39;s lawyers contend the <a href="http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=42565">evidence is crucial</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Sun Daily</span> report] to preparing a proper defense. The delay comes a day after a Malaysian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/malaysia-appeals-court-finds-sodomy-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the country&#39;s ban on sodomy is constitutional. <br /><br />The trial, which was originally set to begin last year, has been postponed several times by Anwar&#39;s defense team. He has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of sodomizing his former aide, Mohd Saiful Bukhari, in 2008 and alleges that the prosecution is part of a government conspiracy to undermine his political agenda. Anwar&#39;s counsel <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/malaysia-high-court-refuses-to-dismiss.php">sought unsuccessfully</a> [JURIST report] to have the case thrown out last month. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s deputy prime minister until he was fired in 1998 following sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/memorandum-heads-executive-departments-and-agencies-1">memorandum</a> [text] directing the heads of government agencies to conduct a review of the tax delinquency status of all companies that compete for federal contracts. Citing a need to protect taxpayer money and a total unpaid tax figure in excess of $5 billion, Obama authorized department heads to review the delinquency status of those companies seeking federal contracts and:<br /><blockquote><br />to evaluate practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to contractors&#39; certifications of serious tax delinquencies and to provide me, within 90 days, recommendations on process improvements to ensure these contractors are not awarded new contracts, including a plan to make contractor certifications available in a Government-wide database, as is already being done with other information on contractors.<br /></blockquote><br />In <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-signing-tax-delinquency-memorandum">remarks</a> [transcript] made before the signing, Obama indicated that he expected swift implementation of the practice.<br /><br />The subject of tax delinquent companies receiving federal contracts has been much debated, including numerous <a href="http://gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) [official website] reports and attempts to pass legislation. In April 2008, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04881:">Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2008</a> [HR 4881 materials] was passed by a voice vote in the House of Representatives and sent to the Senate, where no action was taken. The GAO has released several reports detailing abuses of the tax system by both <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05683t.pdf">civilian</a> and <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0495.pdf">defense</a> [reports, PDF] contractors, with the total delinquency reaching an estimated $6 billion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_01-20-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Wednesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1402.pdf">Berghuis v. Smith</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether there is a constitutional violation when the African-American representation on a jury is disproportionate to the community population. There is a circuit split on whether the so-called the comparative-disparity test, which calculates the percentage of otherwise eligible jurors from a given group who are excluded from jury service, should be used to make such a determination. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit applied the comparative-disparity test and <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0352p-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendant&#39;s Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community had been violated. Counsel for the government argued that, &quot;[t]he Michigan Supreme Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that there was no unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there was no systematic exclusion.&quot; Counsel for the respondent defended application of the comparative-disparity test, dismissing justices&#39; concerns that it wouldn&#39;t apply in areas with a relatively small minority population.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-810.pdf">Conkright v. Frommert</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-takes-international-child.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether a district court has an obligation to defer to an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [text] plan administrator&#39;s reasonable interpretation of the terms of the plan if the plan administrator arrived at the interpretation outside the context of an administrative claim for benefits. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/10e20ac8-a1dd-4158-badc-be7d2091d922/1/doc/07-0418-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/10e20ac8-a1dd-4158-badc-be7d2091d922/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a district court is under no obligation to defer to an ERISA plan administrator&#39;s interpretation and that a district court has &quot;allowable discretion&quot; to adopt any &quot;reasonable&quot; interpretation of the terms of the plan. Counsel for the petitioners argued:<blockquote>Under either a deferential standard of review or a de novo standard, the plan administrator&#39;s interpretation should prevail. That interpretation, unlike the district court&#39;s interpretation, is grounded in the language of the plan. It recognizes the fundamental actuarial principle of the time value of money, and it avoids conferring windfalls.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondents argued that the court does not have to defer to the plan administrator&#39;s interpretation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/138Orig.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/138ORIG">South Carolina v. North Carolina</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">report</a>] that the Catawba River Water Supply Project (CRWSP), and Duke Energy Carolinas may intervene in the water dispute between the two states, but that the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, may not. A special master <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/SpecMastRpt/Orig138_112808.pdf">recommended</a> [report, PDF] that all three parties be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit brought by South Carolina over water flows from the Catawba River. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court:<br /><blockquote><br />Two of the three proposed intervenors have satisfied the standard for intervention in original actions that we articulated nearly 60 years ago in <span style="font-style:italic;">New Jersey v. New York</span>. Accordingly, we overrule South Carolina&#39;s exceptions with respect to the CRWSP and Duke Energy, but we sustain South Carolina&#39;s exception with respect to the city of Charlotte, North Carolina.<br /></blockquote><br />Chief Justice John Roberts filed a separate opinion, concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor.<br /><br />The dispute concerns equitable apportionment of the Catawba River. The Court has original jurisdiction over the case under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1251.html">28 USC &sect; 1251</a> [text] because it is a dispute between two states. South Carolina and the US government argued that third parties should not be allowed to intervene because the states should speak for the interests of all their citizens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian <a href="http://www.ruj.ru/2010/100120_2.htm">journalist died</a> [RUJ press release, in Russian] in a Siberian hospital on Wednesday from injuries he received during a police beating nearly two weeks ago, according to local investigators. Konstantin Popov, an economics writer for a Russian newspaper, was arrested for drunkenness on January 4 and <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/reporter-dies-after-brutal-police-beating/397850.html">taken to prison</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report], where police officer Alexei Mitayev allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted him. Popov suffered severe internal injuries and spent nearly two weeks in a coma before his death. Mitayev, who will undergo a psychiatric evaluation next month, was <a href="http://sledcomproc.ru/news/13150/?phrase_id=70607">charged</a> [official press release, in Russian] with abuse of power and intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, and he faces up to 10 years in prison. Popov&#39;s editor-in-chief expressed concern over police brutality in the country, but said that Popov&#39;s murder was probably <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-russia-slaying21-2010jan21,0,7425256.story">not related to his journalism</a> [LAT report].<br /><br />The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-report-criticizes-russia-on-human.php">criticized Russia</a> [JURIST report] for unsolved killings of journalists and human rights activists and violence against citizens. In November, the chairwoman of Russia&#39;s <a href="http://en.sovetpamfilova.ru/">Council for Promoting Civil and Human Rights</a> [official website] said that Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky had been <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-human-rights-leader-says-lawyer.php">murdered in prison</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month, a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-suspect-confesses-to-killing.php">suspect was arrested</a> for the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-human-rights-lawyer-murdered.php">double murder</a> [JURIST reports] of human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov and journalist Anastasia Baburova. Markelov had represented famed journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politskovskaya</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/russia-top-prosecutor-probing-murder.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. At least 11 journalists have been murdered [CPJ backgrounder] in Russia since 2005, according to the <a href="http://cpj.org/">US Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [official website].

The FPK is an advocacy group representing San, or <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/bushmen">Bushmen</a> [SI backgrounder] people who were relocated by the government from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) in 1997. Sesana said that peace talks with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068674.stm#leaders">President Ian Khama</a> [BBC profile] had broken down and that the FPK would initiate proceedings in the ICJ because previous court orders granting land rights to the Bushmen have been ignored.<br /><br />In 2006, the High Court of Botswana <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/botswana-high-court-rules-government.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government&#39;s eviction of Bushmen inhabiting the Kalahari desert was &quot;unlawful and unconstitutional.&quot; The suit was brought by 239 members of the San tribe aided by FPK and <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/">Survival International</a> [advocacy website]. The Bushmen, whose ancestors have lived in the Kalahari desert for 20,000 years, claim that 12 percent of their fellow plaintiffs died in settlement camps since the government evicted them from the beginning in 1997. The Bushmen claimed that the eviction was motivated by the government&#39;s interest in increasing diamond mining operations, but the government cited concerns over the Bushmen&#39;s opposition to conservation efforts as the primary reason.

The US already has placed body scanners in some airports, and encouraged their use in Europe following the failed airline bombing attempt on Christmas Day. Napolitano <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/europe/22scanners.html">met with security officials</a> [NYT report] from several EU nations at an informal meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs in Spain to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5155447,00.html">discuss terror concerns</a> [AFP report]. Although the the two sides could not come to an agreement on the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Napolitano/EE/UU/pide/nada/nadie/escaneres/corporales/elpepuint/20100121elpepuint_11/Tes">use of body scanners</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> [report, in Spanish], the ministers and Napolitano released a <a href="http://www.eu2010.es/en/documentosynoticias/otrasdeclarac/jaieuusa.html">joint statement</a> [press release] affirming their commitment to share information and work together to eliminate terrorism. The ministers also <a href="http://www.eu2010.es/en/documentosynoticias/noticias/rubalcabacomision.html">requested</a> [EU press release] that the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] accelerate a study on using new technologies, including body scanners, to prevent terrorism.<br /><br />UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/uk-pm-announces-increased-airport.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday that the UK would improve security using several methods, including the use of body scanners. Earlier this month, US President Barack Obama called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">stricter airline security measures</a> [JURIST report] in response to the failed Christmas Day attack. Obama pledged to improve airline passenger security, stating that there had been &quot;a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence,&quot; because the US government had sufficient information to uncover the plot, but &quot;our intelligence community failed to connect those dots.&quot; Abdulmutallab has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A presidential task force has recommended that 35 <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives] prisoners <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100122/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_guantanamo_detainees">face trial or military commissions</a> [AP report], the Associated Press reported on Friday. Government officials said that the proceedings for these detainees will most likely be carried out on US soil. The 35 detainees named in the task force report include five detainees that are already scheduled to be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in New York</a> for the 9/11 attacks and six detainees who have been chosen to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-guantanamo-detainee-referred-to.php">face military tribunals</a> [JURIST reports]. Taking into consideration the detainees to be held without charge, the total number of detainees potentially slated for transfer to the US could reach 80. It is anticipated that at least some of these detainees will be held at <a href="http://www.idoc.state.il.us/subsections/facilities/information.asp?instchoice=tom">Thomson Correctional Center</a> (TCC) [DOC backgrounder] in Illinois, which the Obama administration announced in December it <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-to-house.php">plans to buy</a> [JURIST report]. <br /><br />Last week, the Associated Press reported that the Obama administration is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-considering-dc-trial-for-guantanamo.php">considering bringing charges</a> [JURIST report] in a Washington, DC, federal court against Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2346225.stm">Riduan Isamuddin</a> [BBC profile], the suspected planner of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombing</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In October, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-bill-allowing-transfer-of.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02892:">Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010</a> [HR 2892 materials], which allows for Guantanamo Bay detainees to be transferred to the US for prosecution. However, in December, House minority leader John Boehner <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/congress-could-block-guantanamo.php">expressed doubt</a> [JURIST report] that the two pieces of legislation needed to bring detainees to Illinois will be passed. The Obama administration originally intended to close Guantanamo Bay by January 22, 2010, a deadline that expired on Friday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Amin Mohamed Durrani, a member of the &quot;<a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/350909">Toronto 18</a>&quot; [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> backgrounder; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Toronto+18">JURIST news archive</a>], was released Thursday after pleading guilty in a Canadian court Wednesday to participating in and assisting a terrorist group. Durrani&#39;s <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/01/20/12541661.html">plea</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Sun</span> report], which came as a surprise to many, included an apology and a denunciation of terrorism. As part of the plea agreement, Durrani was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison, but was credited with time served since 2006 and was to be released after one additional day. Durrani also received a three-year probationary period, a lifetime ban from owning firearms, and his DNA will be entered into a national registry.<br /><br />Also this week, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-toronto-18.php">sentenced two members of the group</a> [JURIST report], Zakaria Amara and Saad Gaya, to life and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in the plot to blow up key buildings in Toronto. Earlier in January, another member, Shareef Abdelhaleem, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/toronto-18-member-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of participating in a terrorist group and intending to cause an explosion. The first member of the group, an unidentified minor, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/canada-convicts-first-defendant-under.php">convicted in September 2008</a> [JURIST report], and like Durrani, was sentenced to time already served.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Police in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?id=604&jezik=e">arrested</a> [press release] two former Bosnian Serb detention camp guards on Thursday who were allegedly responsible for the death of around 50 civilians and Bosnian soldiers during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Ratko Dronjak was commander of a detention camp in the village of Kamenica, which held prisoners between 1992 and 1995. Dragan Rodic was a guard at the same camp. Both men are suspected of several crimes under the BiH <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/criminal-code-of-bih.pdf">criminal code</a> [text, PDF] including:<br /><blockquote><br />killing about 50 civilians and prisoners of war, members of the Army of [Bosnia and Herzegovina]; of inflicting serious bodily injuries to a large number of detainees who went through the &quot;Kamenica&quot; camp in the period from 1992 to 1995; for holding them incarcerated under cruel and degrading conditions, creating an atmosphere of terror, depriving them of basic necessities, submitting them through everyday questionings, beatings, torture, harassment, humiliation, psychological abuse; of failing to provide medical care and keeping the detainees in constant fear for their lives.<br /></blockquote><br />Dronjak and Rodic are charged with violating international humanitarian law including war crimes and crimes against humanity. The men will be handed over to the <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?jezik=e">BiH Prosecutor&#39;s Office</a> [official website] for questioning over the next few days.<br /><br />The BiH <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">war crimes court</a> was set up in the 2005 to relieve the caseload of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bosnia-war-crimes-court-hands-down.php">delivered its first sentences</a> [JURIST report] against war crimes suspects from Yugoslavia&#39;s violent ethnic conflicts of the 1990s in July 2008, convicting seven of genocide for their involvement in killings committed at the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison camp. While the ICTY has jurisdiction over high-level war crimes allegations, such as those against Bosnian Serb wartime leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/703/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] and General <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials], the BiH courts can try lower level suspects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Friday that two <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees have been <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-ag-057.html">transferred to Algeria</a> [press release]. <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/533-hassan-zumiri">Hassan Zumiri</a> had spent more than seven years in the Guantanamo detention center, while <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/1452-adil-hadi-al-jazairi-bin-hamlili">Adil Hadi al-Jazairi bin Hamlili</a> [NYT profiles] had been held for five. Both men are Algerian nationals, bringing the total number of <a href="http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesPublicSite/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2056219&Language=en">Algerians released from Guantanamo</a> [KUNA report] to 19. The transfer comes amid criticisms from Republican Congress members after a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] official <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/ex-guantanamo-detainees-increasingly.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] recently that about one in five detainees have returned to terrorist activities, according to a classified Pentagon report.<br /><br />Earlier this week, Slovakia&#39;s <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.sk/">foreign ministry</a> [official website, in Slovak] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/slovakia-to-accept-3-guantanamo-bay.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that Slovakia will be accepting three detainees currently being held at Guantanamo Bay. Closure of the detention facility was initially due by January 22, 2010, but that deadline was not met. The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/jmb-delay-in-guantanamo-closure-due-to.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] blaming missteps by the Obama administration for the delay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Parliament of the Republic of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1063073.stm">Angola</a> [BBC backgrounder] approved a new constitution on Thursday that would end the popular election of the president, despite the refusal of opposition party <a href="http://www.unitaangola.org/WD110AWP/WD110Awp.exe/CONNECT/UNITAANGO?_WWREFERER_=&_WWNATION_=14">UNITA</a> [party website] to take part in the vote. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60J12B20100121">new constitution</a> [Reuters report] replaces an <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/CAFRAD/UNPAN002502.pdf">interim constitution</a> [text, PDF] that had been in place since 1975. It provides for the appointment of the country&#39;s president by parliament&#39;s majority party, ending the direct election of the country&#39;s president. It also replaces the position of prime minister with a vice president, who will be appointed by the president. It limits a president to two five-year terms, but that clause will first take effect after parliamentary elections in 2012. Opponents of the constitution argue that it is merely a way to further expand the power of current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1506759.stm">President Jose Eduardo dos Santos</a> [BBC profile], but members of the ruling MPLA party say that it will allow him to <a href="http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2010/0/3/MPLA-hails-approval-Constitution,85893a98-a945-4546-84df-f9dd0370f67a.html">more effectively rule</a> [ANGOP report] the country.<br /><br />Dos Santos has been in power since 1979. He faced one round of elections in 1992 before a second round was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iA3k8mkzStzIGekIS3f_bQ58DFsQ">called off due to violence</a> [AFP report]. A presidential election that was scheduled for 2009 was delayed while the new constitution was being considered. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/08/12/angola-doubts-over-free-and-fair-elections">expressed doubts</a> as to whether past parliamentary elections were fair and free and has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/14/angola-irregularities-marred-historic-elections">identified problems</a> [HRW reports] with the electoral system.

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/21/AR2010012100870.html?hpid=topnews">legislation</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report] would prohibit banks from owning, investing or sponsoring hedge funds, private equity funds, or proprietary trading funds for profit where the funds do not benefit the banks&#39; customers. Obama termed this rule the &quot;Volcker Rule&quot; after former <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/PVolckerbio.html">Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker</a> [official profile], who stood behind Obama during Thursday&#39;s announcement.  The second part of Obama&#39;s proposed legislation would prohibit future consolidation between banks to prevent any one bank or small group of banks from having a disproportionate, and potentially negative, impact on the economy. Obama emphasized his commitment to banking reform, stating: <blockquote>I welcome constructive input from folks in the financial sector.  But what we&#39;ve seen so far, in recent weeks, is an army of industry lobbyists from Wall Street descending on Capitol Hill to try and block basic and common-sense rules of the road that would protect our economy and the American people. So if these folks want a fight, it&#39;s a fight I&#39;m ready to have.</blockquote>In December, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would create a consumer protection agency, strengthen financial oversight and prohibit certain types of predatory and abusive lending. The US <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to create a consumer financial protection agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST report] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving Obama&#39;s stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. In June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">decided</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to ease restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations. The Court was asked to consider Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. The <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website] argued that Section 203 allowed them to regulate the release of and advertising for a 90-minute documentary questioning then-senator Hillary Clinton&#39;s qualifications to serve as US president. Petitioner <a href="http://www.citizensunited.org">Citizens United</a> [advocacy website], a non-profit conservative advocacy corporation that produced the film, appealed on broad First Amendment grounds a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-65">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which held that the movie was &quot;electioneering communication&quot; within the meaning of BCRA. In its ruling Thursday, the Court overturned its 1989 decision in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1989/1989_88_1569">Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce</a>, which upheld the facial validity of Section 203, and partially overturned <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2003/2003_02_1674">McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Oyez backgrounders], to the extent that it relied on <u>Austin</u>. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority:<br /><blockquote><br />In this case we are asked to reconsider <span style="font-style:italic;">Austin</span> and, in effect, <span style="font-style:italic;">McConnell</span>. It has been noted that &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;">Austin</span> was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles.&quot; We agree with that conclusion and hold that <span style="font-style:italic;">stare decisis</span> does not compel the continued acceptance of Austin. The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether.<br /></blockquote><br />Joining in the majority opinion were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito. Justice Clarence Thomas joined as to all but Part IV, which upheld disclaimer and disclosure requirements. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined the majority as to Part IV only. Roberts filed a concurring opinion, joined by Alito. Scalia filed a concurring opinion, joined by Alito and joined in part by Thomas. Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.<br /><br />The Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in September during a special sitting. The Court originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-campaign-finance.php">heard oral arguments</a> in March, but <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/re-arguments-ordered-in-supreme-court.php">ordered a rehearing</a> [JURIST reports] at the end of the 2008 term to determine whether <u>Austin</u> and <u>McConnell</u> should be overturned.<br /><br />2:00 PM ET - The White House has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-todays-supreme-court-decision-0">sharply criticized</a> [press release] the Court&#39;s decision, pledging to work with Congress &quot;to develop a forceful response.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Imam Hassen Chalghoumi of Paris gave his support Friday to a proposed law that would ban wearing the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] or niqab in public. In an <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/drancy-l-imam-qui-dit-non-a-la-burqa-22-01-2010-787034.php">interview</a> [text, in French] with <a href="www.leparisien.fr">Le Parisien</a>, Chalghoumi said that the full veil is not a part of French culture and that a woman should move to a country where it is accepted if she wishes to wear one. While Chalghoumi supports the ban, he criticized conservative lawmaker <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/tribun/fiches_id/917.asp">Jean-Francois Cope</a> [official profile, in French] for <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-conservative-leader-introduces.php">introducing legislation</a> [JURIST report] without waiting to hear the results of the commission established by <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French], which are expected next week.<br /><br />Cope&#39;s move to introduce legislation last week was in direct opposition to the National Assembly&#39;s November decision <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/france-commission-not-pushing-for-burqa.php">not to push for specific legislation</a> [JURIST reports] banning the burqa. The commission <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/france-commission-begins-hearing.php">began its hearings</a> in July after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/france-parliament-establishes.php">established</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier to address the issue. The controversy between the Muslim community and the secular French government has gone on for several years. In December 2008, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-rules-france-school-could.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that there was no human rights violation when a French school expelled two Muslim students for refusing to remove their headscarves. In July of that year, a Muslim woman&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-denies-citizenship-to-muslim.php">citizenship application was denied</a> [JURIST report] because she failed to assimilate to French culture and practiced a type of Islam found incompatible with French values.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S164830.PDF">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=1896508&doc_no=S164830">case materials</a>] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state&#39;s <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. The court ruled that <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/HSC/1/d10/6/2.5/s11362.77">Health and Safety Code &sect; 11362.77</a> [text], allowing patients to possess no more than eight ounces of dried marijuana, represented an unconstitutional effort by the legislature to alter <a href="http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/215text.htm">Proposition 215</a> [text], a voter-approved initiative, without voters&#39; consent. Because the amendment was not approved through the initiative process, the court found:<br /><blockquote><br />[T]he Legislature is powerless to act on its own to amend an initiative statute. Any change in this authority must come in the form of a constitutional revision or amendment to article II, section 10, subdivision (c). Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that section 11362.77 impermissibly amends the [Compassionate Use Act].<br /></blockquote><br />As adopted, the legislation did not establish specific quantity limits, stating only that patients may possess an amount reasonable for their medical condition.<br /><br />Earlier this month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state&#39;s existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=8859286">allow dispensaries</a> [ABC News report], following California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. California&#39;s Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report], and does not violate the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] said Friday that Haitians who arrived illegally after last week&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive] would be sent back to Haiti. Napolitano <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60L3B720100122">told a news conference</a> [Reuters report] that Haitians should not view the earthquake as an open opportunity to migrate to the US, but should remain in their country to help rebuild. Last Friday, the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">granted temporary protective status</a> [JURIST report] to Haitians that were in the US prior to the earthquake in order to provide &quot;a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti.&quot; She noted however, that &quot;attempting to leave Haiti now will only bring more hardship to the Haitian people and nation.&quot;<br /><br />The DHS announced on Monday that the US will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-grants-humanitarian-parole-to-haiti.php">allow Haitian orphans into the country</a> [JURIST report] to receive needed care in the aftermath of last week&#39;s <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php">7.0 magnitude earthquake</a> [USGS backgrounder] that caused massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenyan officials on Thursday announced the creation of a special tribunal to hear legal claims dealing with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hiv">HIV</a> [JURIST news archive], including discrimination and medical confidentiality cases.  The tribunal will have the legal standing and powers of a subordinate court, and will be under the office of the <a href="http://www.attorney-general.go.ke/">Attorney General</a> [official website].  Earlier this month, Kenya&#39;s <a href="http://www.nacc.or.ke/2007/index.php">National Aids Control Council</a> [official website] unveiled <a href="http://www.nacc.or.ke/2007/default2.php?active_page_id=272&id=332">Part III of the Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan</a> [text, PDF], which outlines the government&#39;s plans to fight the <a href="http://www.nephak.org/hiv%20in%20kenya.html">HIV epidemic in Kenya</a> [NEPHAK backgrounder].  Ambrose Rachier, the tribunal chairperson, <a href="http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=87829">commented</a> [PlusNews report] on the situation and the need for a specialized legal authority:<br /><blockquote><br />Nobody can pretend that there haven&#39;t been cases of violations and abuse of people living with HIV. When an HIV-positive woman is chased from home, either by in-laws or the husband, you have a serious case of human rights abuse.<br /></blockquote><br />Kenya&#39;s Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) decided Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/kenya-lawmakers-refuse-to-include-equal.php">not to grant women equal marriage rights</a> in the country&#39;s new constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/kenya-committee-unveils-new-draft.php">unveiled in draft form</a> in November [JURIST reports].  The PSC, which is composed of members of parliament, will make important decisions in the next week as it continues to draft constitutional language, including whether the country will have a presidential or parliamentary system.  In October, former UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; <a href="/currentawareness/annan.php">JURIST news archive</a>] called for constitutional reform in Kenya before the next electoral cycle begins in 15 months. In 2007, tens of thousands of protesters took to Kenya&#39;s streets accusing President <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] of election fraud after early opinion polls suggested rival <a href="http://www.raila07.com/">Raila Odinga</a> [campaign website] was in the lead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigeria&#8217;s cabinet must pass a resolution within 14 days on whether ailing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile] is capable of running the country, according to an order issued on Friday by Judge Dan Abutu of Federal High Court in Abuja. Yar&#39;Adua has been absent from the country for two months receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Last week, a judge for Nigeria&#39;s Federal High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/nigeria-court-rules-vp-may-take.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/LinksReadPrint.asp?blurb=640">Vice President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [Online Nigeria profile] to assume executive powers due to the prolonged absence of President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua. Nigeria&#39;s cabinet will hear testimony from five doctors to make its decision. If the cabinet finds Yar&#39;Adua to be unfit, Jonathan will <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8474535.stm">take over</a> [BBC report], in accordance with Nigeria&#39;s <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Constitution</a> [text].<br /><br />In 2008, the Nigerian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/nigeria-high-court-upholds-contested.php">upheld</a> the results of <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-ruling-party-wins-poll-but-eu.php">disputed 2007 election</a> that brought Yar&#39;Adua to power, despite opposition groups&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. Yar&#39;Adua had promised to step down if the court invalidated the election. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-creates-election-tribunal-ahead.php">tribunal</a> [JURIST report] formed before the 2007 election to deal with allegations of fraud ruled that the opposition groups lacked enough evidence of fraud to have the results overturned.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/25555114/Criminal-Indictments-in-Zvi-Goffer-Case">indictment</a> [text] of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January10/gofferzvietalindictmentpr.pdf">seven more individuals</a> [press release, PDF] in connection with the probe surrounding <a href="http://www.galleongrp.com/">Galleon Group</a> [partnership website] hedge fund founder <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba083d80-ba8a-11de-9dd7-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=64f9d27e-bcb8-11de-a7ec-00144feab49a.html">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Financial Times</span> profile, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rajaratnam">JURIST news archive</a>] and former hedge fund consultant Danielle Chiesi. The seven defendants were originally arrested in November on insider trading charges, and the 10-count indictment includes additional charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Thursday&#39;s indictment brings the total number of indicted individuals to nine in the probe that currently involves 21 people and is being called the largest hedge fund insider trading probe ever. Seven of those have already entered guilty pleas and the government said last week that an eighth plea agreement is close.  <br /><br />Rajaratnam and Chiesi were arrested in October and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with four other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals, including a managing director at <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel Corp.</a>, a director at <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a>, and a senior executive at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> [corporate websites], provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-indicted-for.php">indicted for insider trading</a> [JURIST reports]. Separately, the government of Sri Lanka has accused Rajaratnam of <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9629749a-bc17-11de-9426-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F9629749a-bc17-11de-9426-00144feab49a.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DRajaratnam%26ftsearchType%3Dtype_news">helping fund</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Financial Times</span> report] the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive], a group designated as a terrorist organizations by several countries including the US. Although records show that Rajaratnam contributed money to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, a charity that the US claimed was a front for the LTTE, Rajaratnam denies funding the LTTE and has not been charged with funding the LTTE.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Moscow court on Thursday rejected an appeal of a lower court ruling that denied recognition of a marriage between two women. The couple, Irina Fedotova-Fet and Irina Shepitko, applied for a marriage license in March, but were refused by the registry. The women appealed to the Tverskoi District Court in Moscow, arguing that nothing in the <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/constit.html">Russian Constitution</a> [text] prohibits the recognition of <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. That court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/russia-court-denies-same-sex-marriage.php">rejected their appeal</a> [JURIST report] in October, and the appeals court affirmed that ruling Thursday, stating that Russia only recognizes marriage <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE60K2UP20100121?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">between a man and a woman</a> [Reuters report]. Counsel for the two women stated that they plan to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100121/157637084.html">appeal the case</a> [RIA Novosti report] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] for a <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=14741305&PageNum=0">violation of Article 14</a> [Itar-Tass report] of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].<br /><br />In Europe, Belgium, the Netherlands, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/norway-parliament-approves-same-sex.php">Norway</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Sweden</a> [JURIST reports] all allow same-sex marriages, while several other European countries allow partnerships with limited rights. Earlier this month, the Portuguese Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/portugal-lawmakers-give-preliminary.php">approved a bill</a> to legalize same-sex marriage after Portugal&#39;s high court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/portugal-high-court-upholds-same-sex.php">ruled</a> [JURIST reports] in August that the right to a same-sex marriage was not present in the country&#39;s constitution. In June, Ireland passed a bill that gave limited rights to same-sex partners. Last year, the European Court of Justice, spurred by a complaint from a German man, ruled that same-sex partners have a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-top-court-upholds-pension-rights-for.php">right to survivor pensions</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu on Friday <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t653351.htm">accused the US</a> [press release] of harming bilateral relations with China after <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website],  gave a <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm">speech</a> [text] promoting Internet freedom and criticizing censorship. Though she did not overtly attack China, Clinton did critique countries that restrict free access of information, declaring that they &quot;risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century.&quot; Clinton also referenced a recent threat by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">pull out of China</a> [JURIST report], calling on Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of alleged cyber intrusions and make its findings transparent. Zhaoxu reponded:<blockquote>The US attacks China&#39;s internet policy, indicating that China has been restricting internet freedom. We resolutely oppose such remarks and practices that contravene facts and undermine China-US relations.<br /><br />China&#39;s internet is open. China is a country with the most vibrant internet development. By the end of last year, China had 384 million internet users, 3.68 million websites and 180 million blogs. China&#39;s Constitution guarantees people&#39;s freedom of speech. It is China&#39;s consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice.<br /><br />Hacking in whatever form and offence of others&#39; privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.<br /><br />We urge the US to respect facts and stop attacking China under the excuse of the so-called freedom of internet. We hope that the US side can work with China to earnestly implement the consensus between leaders of both countries on developing bilateral relationship in the new era by strengthening dialogue, exchanges and cooperation, respecting each other&#39;s core interest and major concerns and properly handling differences and sensitive issues so as to ensure the healthy and stable development of China-US relationship.</blockquote>Google announced its new policy towards China last week in response to a cyber attack on its Gmail service in December. That attack allegedly targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists in China, and drew the ire of rights groups around the world. China <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">responded</a> [JURIST report] by reiterating its commitment to open Internet, but stressed that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. China&#39;s stance on Internet freedom, a source of contention in its relationship with Google, has long been controversial. In June, the Chinese government confirmed that <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-official-affirms-that.php">filtering software</a> [JURIST report] that is to be sold with every computer in China did not necessarily have to be activated. That confirmation came only after the policy of pre-packaging the software with new computers was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-internet-censorship-policy.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by human rights lawyer Li Fangping.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/senate/senate.asp">Hawaii Senate</a> [official website] voted 18-7 Friday in favor of <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/bills/HB444_SD1_.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] allowing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive]. The act would confer upon homosexual and heterosexual couples rights and benefits equal to those afforded married couples in the state. Originally <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&billnumber=444">introduced</a> [materials] last year, public notice requirements forced a vote on the matter to be delayed after an amendment was adopted one day prior to the close of the legislative session. The bill now returns to the <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/house/house.asp">House</a> [official website], though leaders indicate that they may decline to act on it if they do not have sufficient support to override a potential veto from <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/governor/biography">Governor Linda Lingle</a> [official profile]. <br /><br />The New Jersey Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeated legislation</a> to allow same-sex marriage earlier this month, and the New York Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">did so</a> [JURIST reports] in December. In November, Maine voters <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">vetoed</a> a same-sex marriage bill passed by that state&#39;s legislature, while Washington voters <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">approved expanded domestic partnership rights</a> [JURIST reports]. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, and is set to become legal in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports], pending Congressional inaction. New Jersey has recognized <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-jersey-civil-unions-bill-signed.php">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST report] since 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bul_ns_en.nsf/kartaflat/en03.01">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6242774.stm">profile</a>] said Friday that nuclear arms reduction negotiations with the US are likely to resume in early February and will soon result in a landmark nuclear arms reduction treaty. The treaty is to be the successor to the 1991 <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [text], which expired in December. Official negotiations in Geneva stopped during the holiday season, and have yet to resume, although US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/nsa/">National Security Advisor James Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/biography.aspx?id=9">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen</a> [official profiles] were in Moscow this week to further the treaty negotiations. Both US and Russian officials have expressed their desire to conclude negotiations quickly in order to set an example before the upcoming <a href="http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100107_2654.php">Global Nuclear Security Summit</a> [NTI backgrounder] in April, and the <a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nonproliferation/articles/120909_global_nuclear_security_summit/">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference</a> [CAC fact sheet] in May.<br /><br />Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">languished</a> [JURIST report] during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the former Cold War rivals, which reached their worst point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In July, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> and Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profiles] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/europe/07prexy.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2">agreed</a> [NYT report] that the treaty should reduce the maximum number of nuclear warheads that each country could have to between 1,500 and 1,675, down from the previous limitation of 2,200. They also agreed to reduce the maximum number of delivery vehicles allowed to between 500 and 1,100, down from 1,600.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court of Turkey</a> [official website, in Turkish] on Thursday overturned a law that allowed the prosecution of military personnel in civilian courts and prevented military prosecution of civilians during peacetime. The court was <a href="http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=53028">unanimous</a> [AA report] in its decision to overturn the law, which was seen as <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">necessary for Turkish accession</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://europa.eu">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. The law would have allowed civilian courts to prosecute members of the military for attempting to overthrow the government, threats to national security, and violations of the constitution. The decision is seen as a <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1527465.php/Turkish-court-overturns-law-on-soldiers-being-tried-in-civil-courts">hindrance</a> [DPA report] to current investigations concerning an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Turkey%2C+overthrow">alleged plot</a> [JURIST news archive] by the country&#39;s secular <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] group to overthrow the ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. <br /><br />The law was challenged by the opposition <a href="http://www.chp.org.tr/">Republican People&#39;s Party</a> (CHP) [party website, inTurkish] on the basis that it was technically flawed and unconstitutional. In June, Turkish <a href="http://cankaya.gov.tr/">President Abdullah Gul</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/turkish-president-signs-law-allowing.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the law after receiving a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/turkish-military-opposes-civilian-court.php">letter</a> from Turkish military officials urging him not to approve the law because it runs counter to <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/turkey/part_iii_3.html">Article 145</a> [text] of the Turkish Constitution. At that time Gul said that the law was necessary for accession, but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8142257.stm">suggested</a> [BBC report] that parliament should amend the law to clarify the civil court&#39;s jurisdiction over service members.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Friday <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Order-re-Capitol-Records-v.-Thomas-Rasset.pdf">reduced</a> [order, pdf] a $1.92 million jury verdict against a Minnesota woman who was found to have violated music copyrights to about $54,000. Chief Judge Michael Davis of the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/index.shtml">US District Court for the District Court of Minnesota</a> [official website] called the damages amount &quot;monstrous and shocking&quot; and said the facts of the case could not justify the jury verdict. Davis emphasized that Jammie Thomas-Rasset was an individual consumer who downloaded music for her own use and not for profit, and also said that the damages to the plaintiffs, members of the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [trade website], did not support the verdict. The judge ultimately decided the award should be triple the statutory minimum of $750 per song, because Thomas-Rasset willfully shared 24 songs on the file-sharing program <a href="http://www.kazaa.com/">KaZaA</a> [website] and because of the need for deterrence. The ruling also denied a request for a new trial by Thomas-Rasset and gave the RIAA seven days to accept the decision or request a new hearing on the damages issue.<br /><br />In June, a federal jury in Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-jury-assesses-192-million.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Thomas-Rasset had violated music copyrights and assessed damages at $80,000 per song for 24 songs. She was found to have willfully violated copyright law by sharing songs on KaZaA, which has since become a legitimate music purveyor. The proceedings against Thomas-Rasset were a retrial of a previous judgment against her, <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-grants-woman-new-trial-on.php">granted by a federal judge</a> on the grounds that the court erred by instructing the jury that making the music available on the KaZaA network was enough to violate the Copyright Act and that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/recording-labels-win-first-illegal-file.php">$222,000 in damages</a> [JURIST reports] was excessive. In December, the RIAA said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue its controversial policy</a> [JURIST report] of suing suspected file-sharers and instead will seek cooperation with major Internet service providers to cut off access to repeat offenders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Zimbabwe&#8217;s high court Monday struck out evidence from a key witness in the trial of Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.mdczimbabwe.org/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website] party treasurer and deputy agriculture minister-nominee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7889432.stm">Roy Bennett</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roy+bennett">news archive</a>]. Peter Michael Hitschmann was called as the attorney general&#8217;s main witness against Bennett, but alleged in court that security officials tortured him while in custody to obtain statements against Bennett. The State sought to use the confessions and additional e-mail correspondence as evidence to <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=167:state-seeks-to-impeach-witness-in-bennetts-trial-&catid=41:top-headlines">impeach Hitschmann</a> [MDC press release] for inconsistent statements. Judge Chinembiri Bhunu ruled that the statements made by Hitschmann were not freely made, invalid, and could not be used as evidence as they were not signed by Hitschmann.<br /><br />Bennett&#39;s trial <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/zimbabwe-trial-begins-for-opposition.php">began</a> in November after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/zimbabwe-opposition-cabinet-nominee.php">delayed</a> [JURIST reports] in October to allow counsel more time to develop a defense. Bennett&#39;s defense lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, asked the court to prohibit evidence obtained from Hitschmann. Bennett faces <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/10/17/zimbabwe.politician.trial/">charges</a> [CNN report] under Zimbabwe&#39;s <a href="http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/020122posa.asp?sector=LEGISL&year=0&range_start=1">Public Order and Security Act</a> [materials] for unlawfully possessing weapons and provoking others &quot;to commit terrorism, banditry and sabotage.&quot; The weapons charges involve a possible death sentence. Bennett was originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/zimbabwe-minister-nominee-indicted-on.php">arrested</a> on weapons charges in February, and was later <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/zimbabwe-opposition-cabinet-nominee.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] on bail in March. Bennett was then <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-43229220091017">re-arrested</a> [Reuters report] on the same charges in October, only to be released on bail again. Bennett was originally <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-15-for-plotting.php">sought for questioning</a> [JURIST report] in relation to similar allegations in 2006, but he had been seeking asylum in South Africa <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20090130112041597C347722">until recently</a> [IOL report]. Treason charges against him were <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/News/Article.aspx?id=939525">dropped</a> [Times report] in favor of the terrorism and other charges. Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai had nominated Bennett to be deputy agriculture minister.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] on Saturday <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/events/news/9114/">called</a> [transcript, in Russian] for a new age of human rights and safety in the embattled Caucasus region of Russia, where the killings of journalists and human rights activists have become increasingly common. The announcement comes in tandem with the <a href="http://rt.com/Politics/2010-01-24/khloponin-interview.html">appointment of Aleksandr Khloponin</a> [RT report] as new presidential envoy to the area. Speaking at a meeting on the development of the North Caucasus Federal District, Putin said:<br /><blockquote><br />I invite representatives of regional authorities, representatives of local authorities, and law enforcement agencies to do everything possible to ensure proper operation and functioning of human rights organizations, those working within the framework of existing legislation in Russia to help people.<br /></blockquote><br />Deaths of human rights workers are often <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012300963.html">blamed on the local police and security forces</a> [WP report], who rarely face charges. <br /><br />In October, the UN published a report on reforms Russia must take to protect human rights, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-report-criticizes-russia-on-human.php">highlighting the Caucasus region</a> [JURIST report]. The UN report came less than a week after prominent opposition leader and human rights activist in Russia&#39;s southern province of <a href="http://www.ingushetia.ru/">Ingushetia</a> [official website, in Russian], Maksharip Aushev, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/russia-rights-activist-killed-in-north.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] while traveling on a highway in the North Caucasus region of Kabardino-Balkaria. In August, Chechen human rights activist Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband Alik Dzhabrailov were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/russia-human-rights-activist-found-dead.php">found dead</a> [JURIST report]. Sadulayeva&#39;s death came less than a month after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/russia-human-rights-advocate-estemirova.php">death</a> [JURIST report] of activist Natalia Estemirova. Also in July, the body of Russian human rights activist <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/missing-russia-human-rights-activist.php">Andrei Kulagin</a> [JURIST report], missing since May, was found in a quarry. In April, Russian Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/russia-rights-commissioner-concerned.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that activists in Russia were being attacked with greater frequency.

Grybauskaite has publicly said that she believes there were prisoners held in Lithuania, but Usackas has denied this. The dispute follows a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/lithuania-parliamentary-committee.php">parliamentary report</a> [JURIST report] that found that the CIA had been provided two facilities in Lithuania to interrogate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archives] suspects. Usackas has <a href="http://euobserver.com/843/29321">maintained</a> [EUobserver report] that no prisoners were actually held at the locations. On Wednesday, Grybauskaite had <a href="http://www.president.lt/en/press_center/press_releases/foreign_minister_who_has_lost_presidents_confidence_may_not_stay_in_the_government.html">urged</a> [press release] Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius to dismiss Usackas because he had lost the President&#39;s confidence and trust. <br /><br />In December, the <a href="http://www3.lrs.lt/">Lithuanian Parliament</a> [official website, in Lithuanian] National Security Committee reported that the CIA had established secret prisons for al Qaeda suspects in the Baltic country. Lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/lithuania-lawmakers-demand.php">demanded the investigation</a> [JURIST report] in October after ABC News reported in August that former CIA officials said that Lithuania <a href="http://media.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=8373807&pid=3029941">provided the CIA with facilities</a> [ABC News report] for a secret prison for high-value al Qaeda suspects in order to improve relations with the US. The parliamentary committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ingvQqn5r-QON-EWHpJw860_8vlwD9COGA3O1">provided the CIA with two secret facilities</a> [AP report], but it is unclear whether either facility was used to interrogate detainees. The committee uncovered no evidence that former president Valdus Adamkus and former prime minister Algirdas Brazauskas, who were both in office during the specified time period, were told about the secret detention centers.

Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. In an April <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/eleventh-circuit-upholds-noriega.php">decision</a> [JURIST report], the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that his claim was precluded by &sect; 5 of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commission Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], which the Government argued &quot;codifie[d] the principle that the Geneva Conventions [a]re not judicially enforceable by private parties.&quot; Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented from the denial of <em>certiorari</em>, arguing that the Court should use the opportunity to resolve confusion over its decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf"><u>Boumediene v. Bush</u></a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] granting federal courts the power to review <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petitions brought by &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;<br /><blockquote><br />It is incumbent upon us to provide what guidance we can on these issues now. Whatever conclusion we reach, our opinion will help the political branches and the courts discharge their responsibilities over detainee cases, and will spare detainees and the Government years of unnecessary litigation.<br /></blockquote><br />They said that Noriega&#39;s case presented a unique opportunity to address the constitutional question regarding the <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/article-1/51-habeas-corpus-suspension.html">Suspension Clause</a> [Justia backgrounder] without the complications of dealing with classified evidence or &quot;issues relating to extraterritorial detention.&quot;<br /><br />The Court also granted certiorari in the consolidated cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-479.htm">Abbott v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice_president_biden/">Vice President Joe Biden</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amGSJuwszC8">announced</a> [YouTube video] Saturday that the US will appeal a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/memorandum-of-dismissal-of-charges-against-blackwater-guards/original.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">report</a>] dismissing voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges against five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] guards who were indicted for their involvement in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in September 2007. Biden made the announcement during a visit to Baghdad where he met with Iraqi political leaders to help deal with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/world/middleeast/24iraq.html">issues over parliamentary elections</a> [NYT report] scheduled for March. Biden expressed personal regret over the shootings and said that while the charges were dismissed, that was not the same as the men being acquitted. Biden added:<br /><blockquote><br />The United States is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people. While we fully respect the independence and the integrity of the US judicial system we were disappointed by the judge&#39;s decision to dismiss the indictment, which was based on the way in which some evidence had been acquired.&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />Biden said that the US Department of Justice will file the appeal next week.<br /><br />In December, Judge Richardo Urbina of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] dismissed charges against the five Blackwater guards. Urbina cited statements of the defendants that he said were given under the threat of job loss and with the promise of immunity. Because of the unconstitutionality of the statements, Urbina determined, prosecutors had to put together a case without them. The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. A FBI inquiry into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Indian court on Monday rejected a request by suspected <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attack</a> [BBC Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+2008">news archive</a>] gunman <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab</a> [NDTV profile] to be tried in an international court. Kasab claimed he would not receive a fair trial in India and that police had falsely accused him of taking part in the 2008 terror attacks. Special Court Judge ML Tahaliyani <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kasab-wants-to-be-tried-by-an-international-court/articleshow/5499125.cms">denied</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times of India</span> report] Kasab&#39;s request, calling it &quot;premature.&quot; Kasab also requested that he be allowed to examine defense witnesses, including passport officers and government staff, from Pakistan and that he be allowed to meet with Pakistani officials. Tahaliyani told Kasab he <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/01/25/2010-01-25_sole_surviving_mumbai_gunman_mohammed_ajmal_kasab_demands_trial_by_international.html?r=news&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">should file a petition</a> [AP report] through his lawyer. Kasab is facing 86 charges, including murder, for his role in the attacks and, if convicted, could <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">receive the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. A verdict in the trial is expected sometime early this year. <br /><br />Last month, Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-withdraws.php">withdrew his confession</a> [JURIST report], claiming he was tortured and framed by police. Kasab originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> last year, but interrupted his trial to confess and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-stops.php">change his plea to guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in July. Tahaliyani <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">continued the trial</a> [JURIST report] despite Kasab&#39;s confession, ruling that it was incomplete but should be entered into the record. Kasab claimed that he is <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kasab-denies-all-charges-claims-forced-confession/articleshow/5351020.cms">not the man</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times of India</span> report] seen in a photograph holding an assault rifle in the train station. Kasab testified that he had been arrested by police days before the attacks for being Pakistani and that police shot him to make it look like he had been injured during the attacks. He also claimed to have met David Headley, the Chicago man <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/chicago-man-charged-in-2008-mumbai.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the attacks, but only after the attacks when Headley allegedly came to question Kasab in the company of three FBI agents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Myanmar government official has said that pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] will be released from house arrest in November when her sentence is scheduled to end. Witnesses <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60O0J020100125">reported</a> [Reuters report] that <a href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/ministry/home/default.htm">Home Minister Major General Maung Oo</a> [official website] made the statement Thursday during a speech to several hundred local officials in the town of Kyaukpadaung. The government of Myanmar is planning to hold the country&#39;s first elections since 1990 sometime this year, although a date has not yet been set, and Suu Kyi&#39;s supporters see the statement as an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/25/AR2010012500660.html">indication</a> [AP report] that she will not be permitted to participate in the elections. Maung Oo&#39;s statement came just days after the Myanmar Supreme Court heard Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-top-court-hears-latest-suu-kyi.php">appeal</a> contesting an 18-month <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">extension to her house arrest</a> [JURIST reports] that was imposed by a lower court in August. The court is expected to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/01/25/myanmar.suukyi/">issue a ruling</a> [CNN report] in the case within a month.<br /><br />The extension of Suu Kyi&#39;s house arrest stems from an August conviction for violating state security laws by allowing American John Yettaw to stay in her home after he swam across a lake to get there. Yettaw, who was sentenced to seven years in prison with four years of hard labor, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/american-sentenced-with-suu-kyi-being.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in August after negotiations with US Senator Jim Webb (D-VA). Suu Kyi was initially sentenced to three years in prison with hard labor, but her sentence was immediately commuted by junta chief General Than Shwe. Suu Kyi has spent 14 of the last 20 years in detention, and her latest conviction has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8194767.stm">condemned</a> [BBC report] by many world leaders as a political move to prevent her from running in the upcoming elections. Her conviction has given rise to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/eu-extends-myanmar-sanctions-over-suu.php">international sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Myanmar&#39;s junta and members of the judiciary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A German court in Nuremberg has issued an arrest warrant for Argentina&#39;s former de-facto president Jorge Videla for helping to cover up the death of a German citizen in 1978, at the height of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war">&quot;Dirty War&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://www.justiz.bayern.de/gericht/olg/n/">Bayern prosecutor</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5054390,00.html">reopened</a> [DW report] the case in December and requested an order of arrest for Videla after the remains of <a href="http://www.larazon.com.ar/notas/2010/01/22/02125252.html">Rolf Stawowiok</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Razon</span> report, in Spanish] were identified through genetic testing in early 2009. The local Nuremberg court had <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/justicia/alemana/reabre/sumario/ex/dictador/argentino/Videla/elpepuint/20091223elpepuint_9/Tes">closed</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Pais </font>report, in Spanish] the case in 2008 citing a lack of physical evidence as well as an Argentine court ruling declining to extradite Videla for the deaths of another <a href="http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/22012010/54/n-world-justicia-alemana-dicta-orden-internacional.html">two German citizens</a> [EFE report, in Spanish]. Stawowiok&#39;s remains were exhumed in 2004 and were found to have evidence of torture and bullets. Argentine authorities have said that Videla will <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/america/2010/01/23/argentina/1264207315.html">remain in prison</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo</font> report, in Spanish] until he has served his prior sentence.<br /><br />Videla has been in prison since 2008 while an investigation is underway for his role in the abduction of children born to political prisoners and forced disappearance victims during Argentina&#39;s Dirty War. He is also under investigation for the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ex/dictador/Videla/sera/juzgado/31/asesinatos/elpepuint/20090820elpepiint_8/Tes">deaths of 31 political prisoners</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</font> report]. A court revoked the house arrest conditions he had been granted in 1998 when the investigation began. Previously, he had served five years from a life sentence for human rights violations committed during his term in power, until in 1990 he was pardoned by then-president Carlos Menem. In 2006, a federal judge ruled that the presidential pardon was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/argentina-judge-rules-dirty-war-pardon.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Italy has also <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/italy-seeks-extradition-of-139-in-south.php">requested</a> [JURIST news report] Videla&#39;s extradition to prosecute him for the deaths and forced disappearances of Italian citizens during the Dirty War. During the period Videla was head of the military junta (1976-1981), an estimated 90,000 civilians were killed or disappeared.

City of New York</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">report</a>] that the city government lacks standing under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_96.html">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO) [text] to bring a suit against Hemi Group, which operates websites offering cigarettes for sale &quot;tax-free.&quot; The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1ed91fdf-2dae-4bfa-8593-167eed71454e/1/doc/06-1665-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1ed91fdf-2dae-4bfa-8593-167eed71454e/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the city of New York had standing to bring the RICO suit. In reversing the lower court, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />It bears remembering what this case is about. It is about the RICO liability of a company for lost taxes it had no obligation to collect, remit, or pay, which harmed a party to whom it owed no duty. It is about imposing such liability to substitute for or complement a governing body&#39;s uncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from those who owe them. And it is about the fact that the liability comes with treble damages and attorney&#39;s fees attached. This Court has interpreted RICO broadly, consistent with its terms, but we have also held that its reach is limited by the &quot;requirement of a direct causal connection&quot; between the predicate wrong and the harm. The City&#39;s injuries here were not caused directly by the alleged fraud, and thus were not caused &quot;by reason of&quot; it. The City, therefore, has no RICO claim.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a separate opinion, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony Kennedy. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was a member of the three-judge panel on the Second Circuit and took no part in the decision.<br /><br />Also Monday, the Court released its <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/07-11191.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-11191">Briscoe v. Virginia</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>], in which the Court was asked to decide whether a state violates the Confrontation Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag1_user.html#amdt6_hd4">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] by allowing a prosecutor to introduce a certificate of a forensic laboratory analysis without presenting the testimony of the analyst who prepared the certificate. The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that there was no Confrontation Clause violation because the accused has a right to call the analyst as his own witness. The entire text of the Court&#39;s <em>per curiam</em> opinion read:<br /><blockquote><br />We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</span><br /></blockquote><br />Just last term, the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-591.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/forensic-lab-reports-are-testimonial.php">report</a>] 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-591">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-sentencing-gun-law.php">report</a>] that a forensic analyst&#39;s laboratory report is testimonial evidence under the Confrontation Clause, giving criminal defendants a right to cross-examine the analysts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlement.fr/">French parliament</a> [official website, in French] will likely limit a proposal to ban the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and niqab, full face veils worn by some devout Muslim women, to public buildings only, according to Monday reports. A parliamentary panel charged with examining the issue is set to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245965/French-u-turn-burka-ban-fears-terrorist-reprisals.html">report its recommendations</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span> report] on Tuesday, and they are unlikely to press for a complete ban. The potential French <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/gavinhewitt/2010/01/french_burka_ban_looms.html">&quot;burqa ban&quot;</a> [BBC report] has received widespread support from the government, including from <a href="http://www.sarkozy.fr/home/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French]. Any legislation will probably not be voted on until after the French regional elections in March. There is still ongoing debate as to what the proposal should include and whether the ban would violate the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].<br /><br />The parliamentary <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/france-commission-begins-hearing.php">panel</a> [JURIST report]  was created by the National Assembly in July. The panel has heard testimony from anthropologist <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/commissions/burqua/burqua-20090708-1.asp">Dounia Bouzar</a> [video, in French; TIME <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2005/bouzar.html">profile</a>], who suggested that a broad ban on covering one&#39;s face to conceal identity is preferable to a law that singles out Muslims. Bouzar said that the recent popularity of the burqa amongst French Muslims was due to religious &quot;gurus&quot; who have misconstrued the teachings of Islam. The commission also heard from <a href="http://portail.unice.fr/jahia/jsp/index.jsp">University of Nice</a> [academic website, in French] philosopher <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/commissions/burqua/burqua-20090708-2.asp">Abdennour Bidar</a> [video, in French], who urged the commission to find a way to prevent the spread of the practice, though he was unsure whether this goal is best accomplished through legislation. The issue of imposing a full veil ban came to the forefront after a niqab-wearing woman&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-denies-citizenship-to-muslim.php">citizenship application was denied</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 for failing to assimilate to French culture.

Under the new law, monetary donations made between January 11 and March 1, 2010, including those made by cellular telephone, are eligible for the exemption. The measure is designed to encourage additional contributions, as without the bill, taxpayers would not be able to receive credit until next year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Swiss <a href="http://www.bundesverwaltungsgericht.ch/fr/">Federal Administrative Court</a> [official website, in French] <a href="http://www.bundesverwaltungsgericht.ch/fr/20100122_a7789.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF, in German; <a href="http://www.bundesverwaltungsgericht.ch/fr/20100122mmamtshilfeurteil.pdf">press release</a>, PDF, in French] Thursday that an American taxpayer&#39;s financial information at Swiss bank <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] may not be disclosed to the US <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] pursuant to an August 2009 <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/us-swiss-agreement.pdf">agreement</a>  [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-reaches-deal-with-switzerland-over.php%5C">report</a>]. The court ruled in favor of an undisclosed American taxpayer, who appealed a November decision by the <a href="http://www.estv.admin.ch/index.html?lang=fr">Swiss Federal Tax Administration</a> (AFC) [official website, in French] that would have allowed the disclosure. The Federal Administrative Court considered that in light of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Funtreaty.un.org%2Filc%2Ftexts%2Finstruments%2Fenglish%2Fconventions%2F1_1_1969.pdf&rct=j&q=Vienna+Convention+on+the+Law+of+Treaties&ei=VDVbS-WoKZSd8Aav2_n-BA&usg=AFQjCNGh9Kzh8O6i8ndtdrjxtxJXWjfySQ">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> [text, PDF], the current  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/swiss.pdf">US-Switzerland double taxation convention</a> [text, PDF] controls the subject matter of the case. The 2009 agreement under which the AFC acted does not supersede or amend the tax convention. The court also held that the American taxpayer&#39;s failure to file a W-9 form with information about her off-shore finances is akin to failing to declare taxes, even if it pertains to significant amounts of money, and does not rise to the level of tax fraud, which would grant US authorities access. The decision applies to the cases of 25 other American clients of UBS and may not be appealed to the <a href="http://www.bger.ch/fr/index">Federal Supreme Court</a> [official website, in French].<br /><br />The Swiss Federal Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/switzerland-court-rules-ubs-disclosure.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that the <a href="http://www.finma.ch/d/seiten/default.aspx">Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority</a> (FINMA) [official website, in German] violated the law in February 2009 when it ordered UBS to disclose information to the US on more than 250 of the bank&#39;s clients without the authority to do so. In September, the US and Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-switzerland-sign-treaty-on-sharing.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the amount of information shared between the two nations on would-be tax evaders. The agreement, constructed in accordance with Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/57/42219418.pdf">Model Tax Convention</a> [text, PDF], came one month after a Swiss banker and lawyer were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/swiss-banker-lawyer-charged-with.php">indicted in US federal court</a> [JURIST report] for helping clients hide assets. In March, the Swiss announced their intention to adopt a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/switzerland-agrees-to-share-private.php">more stringent definition</a> [JURIST report] of tax evasion and to work with other countries to investigate such claims.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] justice ministers considered Friday whether to use <a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/enhanced_cooperation_en.htm">&quot;enhanced cooperation&quot;</a> [EU backgrounder] to enable some EU countries to work together to create uniform marriage laws for mixed-nationality couples. Incoming EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/reding/index_en.htm">Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding</a> [official website] said that she would <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/justice-divorce.2e6">enter a demand</a> [AFP report] for enhanced cooperation, a technique used when only some EU member states agree. In hearings before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/">European Parliament</a> [official website] earlier this month, Reding <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-67126-011-01-03-901-20100111IPR67125-11-01-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm">said</a> [press release] that she did not like to use such a technique but it must be used for important issues where unanimity is impossible. Reding <a href="http://www.neurope.eu/articles/98216.php">said in a statement</a> [press release] earlier this month that cross-border divorces provide a problem for the EU, citing a common hypothetical situation:<br /><blockquote><br />A German has married a Greek and they are living together in Belgium. Then they have a divorce. What happens with the children? Where are the children going? What law applies to this divorce to the good of the children afterwards? All this has to be clarified at the European level so that these matrimonial questions will not be headache anymore but that people will get concrete solutions and the children are treated for the better of children.<br /></blockquote><br />EU member states have inconsistent marriage and divorce laws. For instance, in July, a British appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-court-recognizes-pre-nuptial.php">recognized a pre-nuptial agreement</a> [JURIST report] for the first time in the UK. Such agreements had been generally disregarded by UK courts hearing divorce proceedings, despite the fact that the rest of the EU and much of the rest of the world recognize such contracts as valid.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">archive</a>] could face a third corruption trial based on new information that recently surfaced, according to Saturday reports. Berlusconi, who is already facing two separate trials on charges of corruption and bribery, is accused of embezzlement and tax fraud related to his television company <a href="http://www.gruppomediaset.it/indexgruppo.jsp?lang=EN">Mediaset</a> [official website, in Italian], though his lawyers have dismissed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/01/24/world/international-uk-italy-berlusconi.html">any substance to the charges</a> [Reuters report]. Berlusconi&#39;s son and 11 other members of Mediaset&#39;s board are <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/article275554.ece">also implicated</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report]. A Milan judge will decide if there is enough evidence to hold a trial, which could begin <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hT1UXPZ-MWlbAd1-3tk8Qxm3v9OQ">as early as February</a> [AFP report]. <br /><br />In October, the Italian <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/index.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/italy-high-court-strikes-down-immunity.php">struck down a 2008 law granting immunity</a> [JURIST report] to Berlusconi and four others, allowing charges to be reinstated. Earlier this week, the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to place time limits on the trial process, which would have the effect of dismissing charges against Berlusconi. Last week, Italian judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-court-again-postpones-berlusconi.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi&#39;s corruption trial at his lawyers&#39; request. He is charged with paying his British lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive] to provide false testimony in two trials involving Mediaset. Berlusconi&#39;s tax fraud trial has also been <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-court-adjourns-berlusconi-tax.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report]. Berlusconi has been previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a> [JURIST reports], and has had some other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesman <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/fyrmcxjl/">Ma Zhaoxu</a> [official profile] stated in a press conference Thursday that Chinese human rights lawyer and activist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gao+Zhisheng">Gao Zhisheng</a> [JURIST news archive] is &quot;where he should be.&quot; Ma stated that holding Gao in Chinese custody since February 2009 comports with the law. The official version of the press conference <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/fyrbt/t653035.htm">transcript</a> [text, Chinese] omitted the exchange between the media and Ma over Gao&#39;s situation. Chinese authorities have shown reticence to discuss Gao&#39;s case, but made the recent statements under <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-activists-demand-search-for.php">mounting demands</a> [JURIST report] from rights groups that Gao be located after being reported missing since September.<br /><br />Gao drew international attention in September 2007 when he wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/chinese-lawyer-detained-for-sending.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to the US Congress requesting assistance in improving human rights in China. Gao, who has also defended Christians and coal miners in China, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/14/world/AP-AS-China-Missing-Lawyer.html?_r=3">claimed</a> [AP report] that he was tortured after his arrest in 2007. Gao was originally part of the Chinese Communist Party and handled prominent cases involving the outlawed <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong movement</a> [Falun Dafa website], but fell into disfavor with the government in 2006 when he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/china-human-rights-lawyer-convicted-of.php">convicted of subversion</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest. China has long received <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+rights">criticism</a> [JURIST news archive] from watchdog groups for its treatment of rights activists such as Gao.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">war crimes court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?id=1502&jezik=e">confirmed</a> [press release] on Monday that three former Bosnian Serb policemen have been indicted on charges of genocide for their alleged roles in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> during the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. Dusko Jevic served as Deputy Commander of the Special Police Brigade, while Mendeljev Duric and Goran Markovic served as Jahorina Training Center Squad Commanding Officers. According to the court, the three former policemen:<br /><blockquote><br />commanded their units, acting individually and in concert with other participants, planned, ordered, incited and took part in the realization of the systemic and joint criminal act. The accused allegedly during the period from 10 July until 19 July 1995, as co-perpetrators, inflicted severe bodily and mental injuries to a group of Bosniaks, committed killings of male members of the group of Bosniaks and forcefully transferred women, children and elderly persons from the UN protected zone Srebrenica in order to completely exterminate national, ethnic and religious group of Bosniaks.<br /></blockquote><br />The three men were <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/bosnia-police-arrest-3-suspected-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in late 2009.<br /><br />Last week, the US <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60J49S20100120">extradited</a> [Reuters report] to BiH Bosnian Serb Nedjo Ikonic, a former commander of a special police brigade, who will also be tried by the BiH war crimes court for his role in the Srebrenica massacre. Earlier this month, police in BiH <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/bosnia-serb-detention-camp-guards.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Ratko Dronjak and Dragan Rodic, two former Bosnian Serb detention camp guards who were allegedly responsible for the death of about 50 civilians and Bosnian soldiers during the Bosnian civil war. The BiH war crimes court was set up in the 2005 to relieve the caseload of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], and is authorized to try lower-level war crime suspects. The court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bosnia-war-crimes-court-hands-down.php">delivered its first sentences</a> [JURIST report] against war crimes suspects from Yugoslavia&#39;s violent ethnic conflicts of the 1990s in July 2008, convicting seven of genocide for their involvement in killings committed at the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison camp. The ICTY retains jurisdiction over high-level war crimes allegations, such as those against Bosnian Serb wartime leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/703/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] and General <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israel&#39;s <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/">Knesset</a> [official website, in Hebrew] approved legislation on Monday to grant immunity to approximately 400 protesters involved in violent protests in connection with the 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/israeli-government-approves-gaza.php">removal</a> [JURIST report] of settlers in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza">Gaza Strip</a> [JURIST news archive]. The amnesty measure, which passed by a vote of <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1145014.html">51-9</a> [Haaretz report], does not extend immunity to people who committed acts that endangered human life, but rather mainly affects approximately 400 teenagers who were charged with committing minor criminal infractions. This is the third general amnesty measure issued by Israel. The first was issued was in 1949, after the War of Independence, and the second was issued in 1967, after the Six-Day War. <br /><br />The tenuous relations between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza have been under international scrutiny lately in light of more recent conflicts. Earlier this month, Israeli military officers <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-officers-abandon-uk-visit.php">cancelled a planned trip</a> [JURIST report] to the UK for fear they would be arrested on charges of war crimes for their involvement in last winter&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm">Operation Cast Lead</a> [Global Security Backgrounder] in the Gaza Strip. In November, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution requiring independent investigations into Operation Cast Lead. According to the <a href="/gazette/2009/09/israel-gaza-operation-human-rights.php">UN report</a> [text], both Israel and Palestine <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">committed war crimes</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.justice.gov.zw/departments/supreme%20court%20and%20masterregistrar/supreme.htm">High Court</a> [official website] ruled on Tuesday that it is not bound by the decision of the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/tribunal/">Southern Africa Development Community Tribunal</a> (SADC Tribunal) [official website] that ordered the state to halt its controversial <a href="http://www.lands.gov.zw/landreform/landreform.htm">Land Reform Program</a> [official website]. The court <a href="http://www.zimtelegraph.com/?p=5658">refused to register</a> [<em>Zimbabwe Telegraph</em> report] a SADC Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the state from acquiring land for the purpose of resettlement. Justice Bharat Patel believed that enforcing the ruling, which was in favor of white farmers whose land was taken over in the government&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">farm redistribution program</a> [JURIST report], would violate the Zimbabwean Constitution and would be against public policy. Patel believed that a decision in favor the SADC ruling would lead to the removal of the majority of the people that the government was trying to support through the redistribution program.<br /><br />The Zimbabwe High Court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/zimbabwe-high-court-invalidates.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the SADC Tribunal is not superior to the courts of the individual SADC member countries. In December 2008, four white Zimbabwe farmers were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-defies-regional-court-charges.php">charged with trespassing</a> [JURIST report] on state property for failing to vacate lands that the government seized for the land reform program, in open defiance of the November 2008 SADC Tribunal ruling. One of the farmers, Colin Cloete, filed suit to cause the government and attorney general to register the SADC ruling in the High Court Registry, a step necessary to enable its enforcement in the country. Government officials have expressed that the land reform program is <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-government-to-ignore-african.php">necessary</a> [JURIST report] to correct past racial disparities that favored the white farmers, and the land reform program will continue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.luzernecounty.org/county/row_offices/district_attorney">Luzerne County District Attorney Jacqueline Musto Carroll</a> [official website] agreed on Monday to drop efforts to retry 46 juveniles whose original convictions were <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] because they had been issued by a judge indicted on federal corruption charges for an alleged kickback scheme. In October, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/default.htm">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] overturned about 6,500 convictions handed down by former <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] president judge Mark Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, but gave prosecutors permission to seek retrial of more than 100 youths who were still under court supervision. Ciavarella, along with former president judge Michael Conahan, has been accused of accepting more than $2.6 million in kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which they had a financial interest. The decision ends all efforts at retrying any of the convicted juveniles, who will now have their juvenile records cleared. The Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.jlc.org/news/31/no_retrials/">statement</a> [press release] applauding the decision, indicating that &quot;justice has finally been attained&quot; for the juveniles. <br /><br />Ciavarella and Conahan are awaiting trial after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">guilty pleas</a> [JURIST reports] they entered in February. The plea withdrawal came after Judge Edwin Kosik of the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] rejected their plea agreements, finding that the men did not accept responsibility and that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/25judge.html?_r=1">prison sentences were too lenient</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">op-ed</a>]. This prompted the two former judges to file a motion for their reinstatement. Kosik refused to reinstate the plea agreements, causing the former judges to withdraw their pleas and clearing the way for a trial. Robert Powell, the owner of PA Child Care and Western PA Child Care juvenile facilities has pleaded guilty to paying kickbacks to both Ciavarella and Conahan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.dot.gov/">Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) [official website] announced Tuesday a <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot1410.htm">federal ban on texting while driving</a> [press release] for commercial truck and bus drivers. <a href="http://www.dot.gov/bios/lahood.htm">Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/lahood01262010.htm">said</a> [remarks] that the prohibition will take effect immediately. Drivers who text while driving commercial vehicles may be subject to civil or criminal penalties of up to $2,750. The regulation, proposed by the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA) [official website] applies to inter-state truck drivers as well as commercial bus or van drivers who carry more than eight passengers. <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/about/contact/hq/anneferrobio.aspx">FMCSA Administrator Anne Ferro</a> [official profile] said:<br /><blockquote><br />Our regulations will help prevent unsafe activity within the cab. ... We want to make it crystal clear to operators and their employers that texting while driving is the type of unsafe activity that these regulations are intended to prohibit.<br /></blockquote><br />The regulation will be publicly posted in the Federal Register on Thursday and appear in print on Friday.<br /><br />The DOT sponsored a <a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/publications/federal_register/2009/html/rita_2009_09_04.html">summit on distracted driving</a> [Federal Register notice; official <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/">website</a>] in September to assess the distractions caused by devices and address issues to reduce accidents on the roadways. The federal ban for commercial drivers comes weeks after Illinois, Oregon, and New Hampshire <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/state-laws-taking-effect-new-years.php">joined the nearly 20 states and the federal government</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=texting+while+driving">texting while driving</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October, US President Barack Obama signed an <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-order-banning-texting-while.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] making it illegal for federal employees or government contractors to use text messaging while driving. In October, the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> [official website] released the results of a <a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811216.PDF">study</a> [text, PDF] that reported 5,800 deaths and nearly 600,000 injuries in traffic accidents in 2008 where driver distraction was indicated on the police report.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S158528.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-2 Monday to authorize the use of &quot;John Doe&quot; arrest warrants, which replace an unknown suspect&#39;s name with his or her DNA profile as the unique identifier. Prosecutors have increasingly been using these warrants as a means of satisfying the statute of limitations in criminal cases. California law, which echoes the language of the US Constitution&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [text], holds that prosecution for an offense commences when an arrest warrant is issued and &quot;names or describes the defendant with the same degree of particularity required for [a] complaint.&quot; Focusing on the point of particularity, the court held that DNA profiles describe the suspect sufficiently for identification:<br /><blockquote><br />A warrant or complaint is an accusation against a person, and not against a name, and [w]hen the name is unknown, the person may be identified with the best description available. ... A genetic code describes a person with far greater precision than a physical description or a name. ... For purposes of the Fourth Amendment, we conclude that the arrest warrant in question, which described the defendant by his 13-loci DNA profile and included an explanation that the profile had a random match probability such that there was essentially no chance of its being duplicated in the human population except in the case of genetically identical sibling, complied with the mandate of our federal Constitution that the person seized be described with particularity. ... We likewise conclude the arrest warrant in question described the defendant with sufficient particularity to avoid a violation of the warrant particularity requirement of our state Constitution.<br /></blockquote><br />Dissenting judge Carlos Moreno questioned the authenticity of John Doe warrants, claiming that the document was &quot;a clever artifice intended solely to satisfy the statute of limitations until the identity of the perpetrator could be discovered.&quot; Moreno stated that the warrant did not become effective until a fictitious name is replaced with the suspect&#39;s real name, and at that point the statute of limitations has expired.<br /><br />The court&#39;s ruling upheld the conviction of Paul Robinson on sexual assault charges. Evidence linking Robinson to the crime was discovered when his DNA was mistakenly collected and entered into the state&#39;s DNA database, which matched his profile with that of the suspect profile in the John Doe warrant. DNA databases are a controversial issue. In May, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-court-upholds-pre-trial-dna.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of mandatory DNA collection for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority. Judge Gregory Hollows of the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] found that although the collection of DNA from those arrested on federal felony, sexual abuse, or violent crime charges does constitute a &quot;search&quot; within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, a person arrested based on probable cause &quot;has a diminished expectation of privacy in his own identity.&quot; Federal agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-expanding-dna-data-collection-to-all.php">began collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, although they had been authorized to do so since 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-ag-084.html">announced</a> [press release] on Tuesday that an Uzbek <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee has been transferred to Switzerland. The detainee, whose identity will not be disclosed in order to facilitate his transition into life in Switzerland, was unanimously approved for transfer. The Swiss government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-to-accept-uzbek-guantanamo.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to accept the detainee for resettlement &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot; after reassurances from the US that the man was not convicted of any crime and will not be a threat to public safety. The detainee was originally cleared for release in 2005, but could not return to Uzbekistan for fear of persecution.<br /><br />The transfer to Switzerland is the latest in series of recent transfers that may demonstrate a renewed commitment from the Obama administration to close the military facility. Other detainees have recently been sent to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Algeria</a>, Afghanistan, Somaliland and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, however, the White House <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that further transfers of detainees to Yemen will be suspended due to security concerns. Last week, a presidential task force <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/task-force-recommends-trials-or.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that 35 Guantanamo detainees face trial or military commissions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-ag-078.html">announced</a> [press release] Monday that three <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees have been transferred to Slovakia. Slovakia <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/slovakia-to-accept-3-guantanamo-bay.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last week that it would accept the detainees, in what was widely seen as an endorsement of US president Barack Obama&#39;s foreign policy. The DOJ made this statement about the transfer:<br /><blockquote><br />The identities of these three individuals are being withheld at the request of the Government of Slovakia for security and privacy reasons. The United States is grateful to the Government of Slovakia for its willingness to support US efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.<br /></blockquote><br />The latest transfers follow a series of other recent detainee transfers to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algeria</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">other countries</a> [JURIST reports].<br /><br />The Obama administration had planned to close Guantanamo Bay by January 22, 2010, but has been stymied by opposition from Congress and the recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/jmb-delay-in-guantanamo-closure-due-to.php">report</a> [JURIST report] blaming missteps by the Obama administration for the delay in closing the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian court on Monday awarded an HIV-positive woman custody of her younger brother. Svetlana Izambayeva <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100125/157679781.html">sought custody rights</a> [RIA Novosti report] in February after her mother&#39;s death left the boy orphaned, but was denied by a city court because of her HIV status. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the <a href="http://www.tatar.ru/?DNSID=8ef3620509d48c82883ffef5bbd0d0df">Republic of Tatarstan</a> [official website] overruled the lower court decision. Human rights groups following the case had called the lower court decision unfair and alleged <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iLi-4AGhJjifO7y-twn2JjPaDt0Q">widespread discrimination</a> [AFP report] against people with HIV in Russia.<br /><br />Monday&#39;s court decision could set an important precedent in Russia. As many HIV-positive Russians claim to experience discrimination from people who do not understand HIV/AIDS, the government and other groups continue to make an effort to raise awareness and educate the public. According to the <a href="http://www.unaids.org">Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> (UNAIDS) [official website], there are <a href="http://www.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/EFS2008/full/EFS2008_RU.pdf">more than 900,000 people living with HIV</a> [UNAIDS fact sheet, PDF] in Russia. Efforts to alleviate discrimination also continue in other countries. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> [official website] removed HIV from its list of communicable diseases of public significance, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-hivaids-travel-ban-lifted.php">ending a 22-year-old policy</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting people with HIV or AIDS from entering the country. In 2008, an Indian court <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/hiv-positive-mother-gets-child-custody_10048323.html">awarded custody</a> [IANS report] to an HIV-positive woman after her in-laws refused to turn over the child.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Dozens of countries have illegally used secret detention facilities in their counter-terrorism efforts, according to a joint <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A-HRC-13-42.doc">study</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9777&LangID=E">press release</a>] issued Tuesday by four independent UN investigating groups. Information for the detailed study was collected through a questionnaire completed by 44 countries, as well several interviews with former detainees, their families, or their legal counsel. The study was particularly critical of actions taken by the US government since it began its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=war+on+terror">&quot;War on Terror&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2001. The report also <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE60P5R820100126?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">acknowledged</a> [Reuters report] that detainees are being secretly held in Algeria, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Russia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. The study stated:<br /><blockquote><br />International law clearly prohibits secret detention, which violates a number of human rights and humanitarian law norms that may not be derogated from under any circumstances. If secret detention constitutes enforced disappearances and is widely or systematically practiced, it may even amount to a crime against humanity. However ... secret detention continues to be used in the name of countering terrorism around the world. The evidence gathered by the four experts for the present study clearly show that many States, referring to concerns relating to national security &#8211; often perceived or presented as unprecedented emergencies or threats &#8211; resort to secret detention.<br /></blockquote><br />The study will be presented to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in March, and will contain many recommendations, including making secret and unofficial detention strictly prohibited.<br /><br />The US has recently come under fire for its alleged use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=secret+cia">secret detention facilities</a> [JURIST news archive] operated by the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. Last month, a Lithuanian parliamentary committee confirmed that the CIA had <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/lithuania-parliamentary-committee.php">established two secret prisons</a> for al Qaeda suspects, prompting a dispute that led to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/lithuania-foreign-minister-resigns-amid.php">resignation</a> [JURIST reports] of the country&#39;s foreign minister. On his third day in office last January, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-issues-torture-ban-orders-cia.php">ordered the closure</a> [JURIST report] of all CIA secret prisons. The European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/eu-parliament-condemns-member-states.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in February 2007 to approve a report that condemned member states for cooperating with the CIA in operating secret prisons. In January 2007, the UK <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/uk-admits-prior-knowledge-of-secret.php">admitted knowledge of the CIA prison network</a>, and then-president George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/bush-confirms-existence-of-secret-cia.php">publicly acknowledged</a> [JURIST reports] in September 2006 that these types of facilities existed. In June 2006, the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/europe-rights-watchdog-says-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] that 14 European countries collaborated with the CIA by taking an active or passive role in a &quot;global spider&#39;s web&quot; of secret prisons and rendition flights. The existence of CIA prisons in Europe was first reported in November 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladesh officials on Wednesday executed two of five former military officers sentenced to death for the 1975 assassination of <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/bangladesh/Profile-Sheikh-Mujib-ur-Rahman/Article1-477971.aspx">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Hindustan Times</span> profile], the country&#39;s founding president, just hours after the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] rejected their petitions for review. The five men, Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Baziul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin, and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had appealed an <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/bangladesh-supreme-court-upholds-death.php">earlier ruling</a> [JURIST report] that upheld their death sentences. Under Bangladesh law, a convict sentenced to death has the right to appeal the final judgment of his case and can petition the president for clemency. Three of the five men had already made clemency pleas, which were <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/bangladesh-president-rejects-mujib-killers-mercy-petitions_100306271.html">rejected</a> [IANS report] last week by President Zillur Rahman. The remaining three are expected to be executed shortly.<br /><br />Mujibur was killed at his home, along with his wife and three sons, in a military coup only four years after Bangladesh <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878969,00.html">won independence</a> [TIME backgrounder] from Pakistan in 1971. His daughter, the current <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.bd/">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed</a> [official website], was abroad at the time of the killings and had promised to make her father&#39;s murder trial a priority of her administration when she was elected in 2008 to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/hasina-elected-bangladesh-pm-in-heavily.php">second term in office</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Honduran <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] President Jorge Rivera on Tuesday exonerated six military leaders accused of abuse of power for removing former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123134.stm">Manuel Zelaya</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zelaya">news archive</a>] from the country last June. Rivera <a href="http://hondurasweekly.com/national/2188-military-chiefs-absolved-of-abuse-of-authority-charges">found</a> [<em>Honduras Weekly</em> report] that the leaders did not intend to harm Zelaya and that his removal was necessary in order to preserve the peace. The Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-court-charges-military.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] the commanders - head of the Joint Chiefs of the Armed Forces Romeo Vasquez, deputy head of the Joint Chiefs Venancio Cervantes, Inspector General Carlos Cuellar, Commandant of the Army Miguel Garcia, Commandant of the Navy Juan Rodriguez, and Commandant of the Air Force Luis Javier Prince - last week and ordered them to remain in the country until after the court had reached its decision. The charges were filed when prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-prosecutors-charge-military.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] to the court that the military commanders violated the <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html">Honduran Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] when they seized Zelaya and put him on a plane to Costa Rica. If they had been convicted, the military leaders could have faced up to six years in prison. Also Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">Honduran National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] approved amnesty for both Zelaya and the military.<br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s ruling comes the day before Porfirio Lobo is scheduled to be sworn into office as president and Zelaya is expected to leave the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras. Last month, congress voted 111-14 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/honduras-congress-rejects-zelaya.php">not to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] Zelaya. This followed a non-binding advisory opinion from the Supreme Court that Zelaya could <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/honduras-high-court-rules-zelaya-cannot.php">not legally return to office</a> [JURIST report]. Zelaya was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] in June, following a <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/general/noticias/Comunicado_Especial.htm">judicial order</a> [press release, in Spanish] asserting that he had broken Honduran law by attempting to conduct a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/honduras-president-proposes-vote-on.php">referendum on constitutional reform</a> [JURIST report], contrary to a Supreme Court ruling. Zelaya, along with the US, the UN, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the European Union, maintain that his removal was a coup, while the interim government of Roberto Micheletti asserts that it was a lawful transition of power.

The two companies agreed to the 10-year settlement terms set by the DOJ and the Competition Bureau, which had <a href="http://www.bureaudelaconcurrence.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/03191.html">determined</a> [press release] after reviewing the original merger terms that the move &quot;raised serious economic concerns&quot; and &quot;would deter other companies from entering the market to compete against the merged&quot; corporation. According to the DOJ, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-at-081.html">settlement</a> [press release]:<br /><blockquote><br />will require Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc. to license its ticketing software, divest ticketing assets and subject itself to anti-retaliation provisions in order to proceed with its proposed merger with Live Nation Inc. ... [to] protect competition for primary ticketing, which will in turn maintain incentives for innovation and discounting.<br /></blockquote><br />The settlement will enable <a href="http://www.aegworldwide.com/home.html">Anschutz Entertainment Group</a> (AEG) and another suitable buyer, likely <a href="http://www.comcast-spectacor.com/">Comcast-Spectacor</a> [corporate websites], to compete with the merged corporation.<br /><br />The Obama administration has pledged to increase reviews of proposed mergers. In September, the DOJ and the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/09/mgr.shtm">announced</a> [press release] that they are considering revisions to the Horizontal Mergers Guidelines.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chinese court Tuesday sentenced four more people to death in connection with the July <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=xinjiang+riot">Xinjiang riots</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Urumqi sentenced eight others to life in prison and one to the death penalty with a two-year reprieve, which is usually commuted to life in prison. To date, at least 26 people have received death sentences for their roles in the riots. In November, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-executes-9-convicted-of-xinjiang.php">carried out the executions</a> [JURIST report] of nine others convicted in connection with the riots for murder, assault, arson, and robbery, after a review by the <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] upheld their sentences.<br /><br />The actions of the Chinese government in the aftermath of the riots have been <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-xinjiang-riot-trials-fail-to-meet.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. HRW has stated that the trials of the suspected rioters have been marred by infringements on due process and political considerations. Additionally, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-officials-disappeared-uighurs.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that more than 40 Uighurs had disappeared while in the custody of Chinese authorities after large-scale sweeps by police. Residents of the region claim that the majority of the deaths were at the hands of Chinese authorities, but Chinese state media has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/07/content_11663866.htm">reported</a> [Xinhua report] that most of the deaths were due to protesters. The Chinese government has admitted that police were <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/china-official-says-police-killed-12-in.php">responsible for 12 of the deaths</a> [JURIST report]. The Muslim Uighur population is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8137206.stm">opposed</a> [BBC backgrounder] to China&#39;s restrictive bans on religious practice and says that the recent influx of Han Chinese has disenfranchised non-Chinese-speaking Uighurs. Violence broke out July 5, after Uighurs attacked Han Chinese during protests ignited by an attack at a factory in southern China that left two Uighurs dead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French parliamentary commission charged with investigating whether to enact laws banning the wearing of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqas</a> [JURIST news archive] or other &quot;full veils&quot; released its <a href="/pdf/rapportviole.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; in French] Tuesday calling for a partial ban. The panel urged a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/01/20101269170257444.html">ban</a> [Al Jazeera report] that would apply in public facilities, including hospitals, schools, and public transportation, and to any individual attempting to receive public services. The panel also recommended that permanent residency and citizenship be denied to anyone displaying their adherence to &quot;radical religious practices.&quot; The commission did not recommend a total ban on the burqa because not all members agreed that such a move would be constitutional. The potential ban has received widespread <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/26/france.burqa.ban/">support</a> [CNN report] throughout France. Any legislation will probably not be voted on until after the French regional elections in March.<br /><br />The commission <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/france-commission-begins-hearing.php">began its hearings</a> in July after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/france-parliament-establishes.php">established</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier to address the issue. The panel has heard testimony from numerous experts, including anthropologist <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2005/bouzar.html">Dounia Bouzar</a> [TIME profile], who suggested that a broad ban on covering one&#39;s face to conceal identity is preferable to a law that singles out Muslims. Bouzar said that the recent popularity of the burqa amongst French Muslims was due to religious &quot;gurus&quot; who have misconstrued the teachings of Islam. The commission also heard from <a href="http://portail.unice.fr/jahia/jsp/index.jsp">University of Nice</a> [academic website, in French] philosopher Abdennour Bidar, who urged the commission to find a way to prevent the spread of the practice, though he was unsure whether this goal is best accomplished through legislation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ugandan Principal Judge James Ogoola said Monday that the newly established <a href="http://www.judicature.go.ug/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=117&Itemid=154">War Crimes Division</a> (WCD) [official website, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda+%22war+crimes+court%22">news archive</a>] of the High Court will seek to recruit foreign judges. Ogoola <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/708187">explained the need</a> [<em>New Vision</em> report] for foreign judges, citing the international nature of the cases. He said that foreign judges would improve both the quality of the WCD&#39;s work and the public&#39;s perception of the court. In June, WCD officials began reaching out to the areas most affected by the war with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3462901.stm">Lord&#39;s Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lord%27s+Resistance+Army">news archive</a>] in the Acholi, Lango, Teso, and District of Adjumani regions of the country, seeking to lay the groundwork for future investigations.  <br /><br />Ogoola appointed three High Court Judges to serve on the WCD in July 2008 after the new division was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/uganda-establishes-special-war-crimes.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in May of that year. The WCD was formed specifically to try war crimes cases involving the LRA and will <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/uganda-war-crimes-court-will-only-hear.php">not hear other allegations</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes. Uganda&#39;s government <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uganda-government-reaches-war-crimes.php">agreed to create the war crimes court</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008 during peace negotiations with the LRA. At the time, there was speculation that the WCD, which has the authority to try LRA leaders, was created to persuade the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to drop its arrest warrants for LRA leaders. More than four years after the warrants were initially issued, the ICC is <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-still-seeking-arrest-of-uganda-war.php">still seeking the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of LRA leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> [BBC profile] and his deputies.

Government spokesperson Ali al-Dabbagh stated that al-Majid had committed crimes of mass murder and premeditated bodily harm against the Iraqi population. Al-Majid was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iraq-court-hands-down-fourth-death.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month of ordering the gassing and sentenced to death. The gassing, which killed 5,000 Kurds, was part of the wider <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anfal">Anfal campaign</a> [JURIST news archive] against Kurds in Iraq during the Saddam Hussein regime, and is considered one of the worst attacks on the ethnic minority.<br /><br />Al-Majid had received three prior death sentences. In March, al-Majid received his <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">third death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the 1999 killings of protesters who rioted in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr. In December 2008, the Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraqi-tribunal-gives-chemical-ali.php">sentenced al-Majid to death</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq during the Saddam regime. Al-Majid was also sentenced to death for another killing of Kurdish Iraqis using chemical weapons during the Anfal campaign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former chief legal adviser to the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ha/notewriters/wood.pdf">Sir Michael Wood</a> [UN profile, PDF] told the <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/">Iraq Inquiry</a> [official website] in a <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/transcripts/oralevidence-bydate/100126.aspx">public hearing</a> [video] on Tuesday that he had advised the Foreign Ministry that the 2003 Iraq invasion was illegal. Woods testified that the invasion was &quot;contrary to international law&quot; because it was never authorized by the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website]. Woods said that then-Foreign Ministry secretary <a href="http://www.jackstrawmp.org.uk/Biography.asp">Jack Straw</a> [parliamentary profile] rejected his advice that there was no legal basis for the invasion and that it was not supported by UN resolutions, including <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/unscr1441.htm">Resolution 1441</a> [text]. During the inquiry, Woods <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/43614/100126am-wood.pdf">stated</a> [transcript, PDF]:<br /><blockquote><br />He took the view that I was being very dogmatic and that international law was pretty vague and that he wasn&#39;t used to people taking such a firm position. When he had been at the Home Office ... he had often been advised things were unlawful and he had gone ahead anyway and won in the courts.<br /></blockquote><br />Last week, Wood released a <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/43477/wood-statement.pdf">written statement</a> [text, PDF] outlining the legal advice he had given to the foreign ministry. In his statement, Woods held that self defense requires an imminent attack, and Iraq&#39;s regime change alone was not considered an actual or imminent threat.  He went on to state that taking preemptive steps beyond self defense &quot;had no basis in international law.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Iraq Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/former-uk-ag-warned-cabinet-iraq.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a 2002 <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/42845/goldsmith-hoon-letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] from former UK attorney general <a href="http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=4f6286dc-73f9-4bed-a90f-2a6923a19f77">Peter Goldsmith</a> [professional profile] to former secretary of defense <a href="http://www.geoffhoonmp.co.uk/biog/">Geoffrey Hoon</a> [personal profile] in which Goldsmith warned the Cabinet that the Iraq invasion was not supported by international law. The letter stated that Goldsmith was having &quot;considerable difficulty&quot; supporting a legal foundation for the Iraq invasion. Former UK prime minister <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/blair.php">news archive</a>] is also facing criticism after the Inquiry released a letter from Goldsmith written to Blair in July 2002, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-uk-pm-blair-was-warned-iraq.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] Blair that the planned invasion of Iraq could be illegal. The letter laid out the reasons that Goldsmith believed the Iraq invasion might be illegal, including that an invasion could not be based on &quot;regime change&quot; alone. The existence of this letter will increase the difficulty for Blair to use a good-faith defense against charges that he knowingly led the country into an illegal invasion. Blair is scheduled to testify before the Inquiry this week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A suicide bomber detonated a car bomb outside of the Forsenics Lab of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior&#39;s Criminal Investigation Department on Tuesday, killing 21 people and injuring at least 80 others. The building <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/01/201012681648454836.html">collapsed</a> [Al Jazeera report] shortly after the attack, which comes one day after a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100126/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq">wave of attacks</a> [AP report] against several Baghdad hotels frequented by westerners. Some have suggested that the attacks might be in retaliation for Monday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/chemical-ali-executed-in-iraq-for.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2855349.stm">Ali Hassan al-Majid</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=majid">news archive</a>], better known as &quot;Chemical Ali.&quot; Tuesday&#39;s bombing has also aroused concerns about Iraq&#39;s ability to ensure citizens&#39; safety in the run-up to the general election scheduled for next month. Iraq&#39;s election legislation was just <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iraq-lawmakers-approve-amended-election.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] in December, causing the election to be <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-44534120091207">pushed back</a> [Reuters report] from January 31 to February 27. <br /><br />This is not the first time Iraqi ministries have been targeted by suicide bombers. Earlier this month, an Iraqi court sentenced 11 men to death for the August 19 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8208976.stm">bombing of the foreign and finance ministries</a> [BBC report] in Baghdad that left close to 100 dead. Iraq is also seeking an investigation into the <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/baghdad-suicide-bombers-target-justice.php">twin suicide bombings</a> [JURIST report] in Baghdad in October that killed at least 132 people. The bombings targeted the ministry of justice and the headquarters of the local provincial government ahead of an attempt by the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] to resolve a political stalemate to permit changes to the country&#39;s election law. Iraqi Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.iq/english/theministry/minister.aspx?pageid=37">Hoshiyar Zebari</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/iraq-renews-call-for-un-inquiry-after.php">renewed calls</a> [JURIST report] in October for a formal UN inquiry to investigate those responsible for the bombings. Zebari asked the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">General Assembly</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official websites] to appoint a special envoy to probe possible sources that are targeting the country&#39;s stability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French court on Thursday acquitted former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2768503.stm">Dominique de Villepin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Villepin">news archive</a>] of all charges for his role in an alleged plot to defame several businessmen, including current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>]. Prosecutors claimed de Villepin <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20091020-de-villepin-sarkozy-allegations-clearstream-justice-france">failed to stop the circulation of false documents</a> [France24 report], alleging Sarkozy profited from illegal arms deals when the two were vying for the presidency. Before his acquittal, de Villepin had faced the possibility of an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a &#8364;45,000 fine. Sarkozy said Thursday that he will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/world/europe/29france.html">not appeal the verdict</a> [NYT report].<br /><br />In October, de Villepin denied breaking the law and claimed that Sarkozy <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-prosecutors-recommend-ex-pm-get.php">ordered the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] for personal and political reasons. De Villepin and his alleged co-conspirators <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-ex-pm-goes-on-trial-for-sarkozy.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] last September. In November 2008, de Villepin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/france-ex-pm-indicted-in-defamation.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for his connection with the long-running political scandal known as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4965734.stm">Clearstream Affair</a> [BBC backgrounder]. De Villepin&#39;s political image was tainted by the allegations as well as by his advance of an unpopular <a href="/currentawareness/cpe.php">youth labor law</a> [JURIST news archive] during his time as prime minister.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian racial hate crimes <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/6BB41EE/E48156E">decreased slightly in 2009</a> [press release] because of increased police efforts, according to the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] on Wednesday. According to the group, 71 people were killed and 333 wounded in racially motivated attacks in 2009, down from 110 killed and 487 wounded in 2008. Deputy head of SOVA Galina Kozhevnikova credited the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/racist-violence-drops-in-russia/398413.html">first decrease in hate crimes in the last six years</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report] to a combination of revised legislation, extended criminal trials, and enhanced police tactics. Despite the lower violent crime statistics, Sova&#39;s annual report also noted the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/27/AR2010012701597.html">increasing volume of xenophobic propaganda</a> [AP report], particularly among right-wing, political youth groups. <br /><br />Last year, the SOVA Center reported a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/russia-hate-crimes-up-slightly-in-2008.php">slight rise in hate crimes in 2008</a> after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/russia-hate-crimes-up-13-percent-in.php">13 percent rise in hate crimes in 2007</a> [JURIST reports]. Kozhevnikova criticized Russian authorities at the time for not responding to the increase in violence, saying that many hate crimes were only prosecuted as incidents of hooliganism, which would carry a lighter sentence than hate crimes. In 2008, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] published a <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/reports.aspx?s=russia&p=index">hate crime survey</a> [text] that called attention to the then increasing number of violent crimes against immigrants and non-Slavic people in Russia.

The two executed men, identified as Momammed Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/world/middleeast/29iran.html">convicted</a> [NYT report] on charges of mohareb, or being enemies of God, and had earlier been appeared in televised show trials. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/shocking-execution-iran-protesters-condemned-20100128">condemned</a> [press release] the executions, saying, &quot;[t]hese shocking executions show that the Iranian authorities will stop at nothing to stamp out the peaceful protests that persist since the election.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, Iran&#39;s Prosecutor-General <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/vevak.htm">Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei</a> [GlobalSecurity profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-urges-sedition.php">called for sedition trials</a> [JURIST report] against leaders of protests following last June&#39;s contested presidential election. The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Last month, AI <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years. In September, human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of rights violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php">beatings</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-forcing-confessions-from-political.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

Making the decree during his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703410004575029491921019032.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond">inaugural address</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> report], Lobo said that it would allow the country to move past the conflict. He also said that he would appoint a special commission to investigate the circumstances of the coup, even though no prosecutions would result. Commentators suspect that Lobo may face trouble <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/world/americas/28honduras.html?scp=1&sq=lobo%20amnesty&st=cse">legitimizing his presidency</a> [NYT report], though the US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-announces-presidential-delegation-honduras">sent a delegation to his inauguration</a> [press release] as a sign of support for the leader. Also Wednesday, Zelaya left the country to go into exile in the Dominican Republic.<br /><br />The amnesty decree was approved by the <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">Honduran National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday.

Last month, the Honduran Congress voted 111-14 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/honduras-congress-rejects-zelaya.php">not to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] Zelaya. His ouster was the result of a <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/general/noticias/Comunicado_Especial.htm">judicial order</a> [press release, in Spanish] that asserted that Zelaya had broken Honduran law by attempting to conduct a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/honduras-president-proposes-vote-on.php">referendum on constitutional reform</a> [JURIST report], contrary to a Supreme Court ruling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] could face legal problems in registering a trademark for its new iPad tablet computer product <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/27ipad.html">announced</a> [press release] on Wednesday. Since 2003, the computing company Fujitsu has been <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=76497338">attempting to register the &quot;IPAD&quot;</a> [USPTO record] mark in the US for a wireless retail computing device. Apple, however recently filed for an <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=76497338&pty=EXT&eno=6">extension</a> [USPTO materials, PDF] to allow itself sufficient time to prepare an opposition to Fujitsu&#39;s registration of the mark. It may be <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-28/apple-s-ipad-name-may-lead-to-trademark-feud-with-fujitsu.html">possible for both companies to register the mark</a> [Bloomberg report], as long as Apple can successfully argue that there would not be any likelihood of confusion between its personal tablet and Fujitsu&#39;s retail device.<br /><br />Apple&#39;s potential dispute over trademark rights with Fujitsu is the latest example of Apple&#39;s intellectual property issues. In October, Nokia sued Apple alleging that the iPhone contains technology that <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">infringes 10 Nokia patents</a> [JURIST report]. In April, Apple was found to have <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/04/apple-found-guilty-of-willful-patent-infringement.ars">infringed a predictive snooping patent</a> [Ars Technica report] owned by Opti. Inc. In July 2008, the inventor of so-called &quot;visual voicemail&quot; <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN1626330020080616">settled a patent infringement case</a> [Reuters report] with Apple over the company&#39;s use of that function in the iPhone.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  US President Barack Obama sharply criticized the Supreme Court&#39;s recent decision in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [JURIST report], which eased restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations and labor unions, in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union Address</a> [transcript] Wednesday night. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision.  In addition to his support for campaign finance reform, the president also reiterated his <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">previous commitment</a> to repeal the controversial &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy that prohibits gay Americans from serving in the military, despite the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pentagon-lawyers-advise-waiting-to.php">advice of Pentagon lawyers</a> [JURIST reports] to postpone reviewing the matter.  Health care and clean energy initiatives were also addressed.   Obama acknowledged the difficulties facing comprehensive <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Health+Care+Reform">health care reform</a> [JURIST news archive], but encouraged lawmakers to continue working toward a functional and acceptable solution.  Stressing the importance of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=clean+energy">clean energy</a> [JURIST news archive], the president pushed for legislation to support investment in such technologies to promote both job creation and climate change.<br /><br />In its ruling last week, the Supreme Court cited First Amendment concerns in overturning Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. The Court, in a <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">5-4 decision</a> [opinion, PDF], said that, &quot;[t]he Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether.&quot; The White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-todays-supreme-court-decision-0">immediately responded</a> [press release] by pledging to work with Congress &quot;to develop a forceful response.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/index.html">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/uksc_2009_0016_judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/uksc_2009_0016_ps.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] Wednesday that executive orders allowing the government to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists are illegal. The five men involved in the court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uk-supreme-court-hears-inaugural-case.php">inaugural case</a> [JURIST report] argued that the government exceeded its power when the <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/">Treasury Department</a> [official website] froze their assets without the approval of Parliament. They are accused by the British government of terrorism offenses, but have not been formally charged by any court. Justice Lord Hope said the orders, which can be extended indefinitely, are unduly burdensome on those accused of links to terrorism:<br /><blockquote><br />The consequences of the Orders that were made in this case are so drastic and so oppressive that we must be just as alert to see that the coercive action that the Treasury have taken really is within the powers that [Parliament] has given them. Even in the face of the threat of international terrorism, the safety of the people is not the supreme law. We must be just as careful to guard against unrestrained encroachments on personal liberty. <br /></blockquote><br />The court found that the government exceeded its authority by allowing Treasury to freeze assets based solely on &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of involvement in terrorist activity, and by not providing for judicial review of the seizures.<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s ruling affirms a 2008 High Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-high-court-rules-terror-suspect.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], which found that the Treasury Department may not freeze the assets of the five suspected terrorists without the approval of Parliament. The seizures were conducted pursuant to two <a href="http://www.privycouncil.gov.uk/output/page534.asp">Orders in Council</a> [backgrounder], the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062657.htm">Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</a> and the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062952.htm">Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures] Order 2006</a> [texts]. The orders implemented UN resolutions requiring UN member states to freeze the assets of people on a <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolist.shtml">UN list of suspected al Qaeda and Taliban associates</a> [UN materials]. The High Court rejected the orders because they were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny before they came into force.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Yemeni government official said Wednesday that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> will build a rehabilitation center for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives] detainees. According to the anonymous official, Yemen will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60Q3EE20100127">begin building</a> [Reuters report] once it receives funding for the $11 million project promised by the US. It is believed the rehabilitation center will be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7080763/Yemen-to-host-Guantanamo-rehab-centre.html">internationally financed and monitored</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report]. The project will be discussed on Wednesday at a meeting intended to garner international support in the wake of discovering that a Yemeni branch of al Qaeda trained the Nigerian man involved in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">attempted Christmas day bombing</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />The White House announced earlier this month that the US government will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspend transfers</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo Bay detainees to Yemen based on security concerns. Most of the nearly 200 detainees remaining at Guantanamo are Yemeni, and many detainees have been transferred back to Yemen. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dc-circuit-upholds-broad-presidential.php">upheld the detention</a> [JURIST report] of Yemeni Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/128-ghaleb-nassar-al-bihani#1">Ghaleb Nassar Al-Bihani</a> [NYT materials], ruling that he can remain in US custody, but, last month, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">transferred six detainees</a> [JURIST report] back to Yemen. Also last month, a federal judge granted Yemeni detainee Saeed Hatim&#39;s petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-orders-release-of-yemeni.php">ordering his release</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ireland&#39;s <a href="http://www.safeandlegalinireland.com/sl_law.html">restrictive abortion laws</a> [advocacy backgrounder] increase health risks to women and expose them to deliberate misinformation about abortion procedures, according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/88013/section/1">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/28/ireland-abortion-limits-violate-human-rights">press release</a>] released on Thursday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. Ireland&#39;s current legislation prohibits abortion for any reason except when the mother&#39;s life is threatened and carries a potential sentence of life imprisonment. The report states that Ireland&#39;s restrictive laws create a heavy financial and emotional burden on women who are forced to find alternatives either secretly or abroad. According to HRW, &quot;[s]ince 1980, hundreds of thousands of women have traveled to the UK from Ireland to terminate their pregnancies.&quot; HRW women&#39;s rights advocacy director Marianne Mollmann said:<br /><blockquote><br />Women in need of abortion services should, as a matter of international law and - frankly - human decency, be able to count on support from their government as they face a difficult situation. But in Ireland they are actively stonewalled, stigmatized, and written out.<br /></blockquote><br />According to the report, the government also fails to regulate &quot;rogue&quot; pro-life agencies who provide women with false information about abortions.<br /><br />The release of this report comes as Ireland awaits what may be a landmark decision on women&#39;s rights in Ireland. In December, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (EHCR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/europe-rights-court-hears-ireland.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] in a case brought by three women alleging that current Irish abortion laws violate their rights under the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The three women, who all traveled to the UK to have abortions, lodged the complaint in July 2005, alleging that the current Irish abortion laws make the procedure &quot;unnecessarily expensive, complicated, and traumatic.&quot; A <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1210/1224260424256.html">judgment is expected</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report] in six to eight months.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US citizen David Headley pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 12 charges related to the 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attack</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=2008+mumbai+terror">news archive</a>] and an alleged conspiracy against the Danish creator and publishers of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon">controversial cartoons</a> [JURIST news archive] depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The government has <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2010/pr0114_01a.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] Headley of conducting surveillance for terrorist organization <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder] in Mumbai to prepare for the 2008 attack. Headley and two others are also charged in the same indictment with conspiring to bomb the headquarters of Danish newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://jp.dk/">Jyllands-Posten</a></span> [media website, in Danish], which published the cartoons. Tahawwur Rana, an alleged LeT member who was charged with Headley, also pleaded not guilty in the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website]. The US government has not yet apprehended the two men accused of plotting with Headley to attack <span style="font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten</span>. A hearing is scheduled for February 23.<br /><br />Earlier this week, an Indian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/india-court-rejects-mumbai-terror.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by the lone surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks for an international trial. Muhammad Ajmal Amir Kasab claims he will not receive a fair trial in India. Kasab, whom India claims participated directly in the Mumbai attacks, said during his trial that he met Headley, but only while in jail after being arrested. Headley was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-indicts-4-for-2008-mumbai-terror.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month along with Rana, a Canadian citizen living in Chicago, retired Pakistani military officer Abdur Rehman, and Ilyas Kashmiri, an alleged terrorist leader believed to have ties to al Qaeda. The indictment was a superseding indictment, reiterating <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/chicago-man-charged-in-2008-mumbai.php">charges originally brought</a> [JURIST report] against Headley in December.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China&#39;s <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> (SPC) [official website, in Chinese] on Wednesday announced new anti-corruption rules in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. The <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-01/27/c_13153229.htm">new regulations</a> [Xinhua report] prohibit various activities including accepting bribes, having sex with litigants, intimidation, and intentionally prolonging court proceedings, with punishments ranging from demerits to removal. Chinese courts are under the control of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/ccp.htm">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-to-crack-down-on-corruption.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to increase its oversight of the families of government officials to control corruption. A communique released by the CPC&#39;s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which is in charge of detecting and preventing corruption in the CPC, ordered other CPC organs to carefully monitor officials to make sure they are not accepting bribes or receiving improper gifts.<br /><br />China&#39;s new judicial regulations come after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former SPC vice president Huang Songyou on bribery and embezzlement charges earlier this month. Huang is the highest-ranking judge to be charged with corruption since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. Between 2005 and 2008, Huang allegedly embezzled 3.9 million yuan (about $574,000 USD) while serving as vice president of the SPC, and he allegedly embezzled 1.2 million yuan (about $175,000 USD) while serving as president of the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Zhanjiang in 1997.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] on Wednesday cited costs and potential disruptions to the lives of New Yorkers in urging the federal government not to try alleged 9/11 conspirator <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] and other high-profile terror suspects in New York City. Bloomberg said a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h8krg3Dia3yco5LDiSNV2CXZGvsg">military base may be a more appropriate venue</a> [AFP report] for the trial since they are generally in secluded areas, though he said his request was not based on security concerns. Earlier this month Bloomberg <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/911-trial-security-to-cost-more-than.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that providing security for the trial in New York would cost the city more than $216 million in the first year and $206 million in any additional years. Bloomberg originally backed the idea of trying some of the terrorists currently held in the detention facility at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in Manhattan due to its proximity to ground zero and the symbolic significance of convicting the suspects there.<br /><br />In November, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-defends-911-federal-trials.php">appeared before the Senate</a> to defend <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">plans</a> [JURIST reports] to try Mohammed, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ramzi">Ramzi Bin Al Shibh</a> [JURIST news archive], Walid Bin Attash, Ali Abdul-Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Al Hawsaw in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Earlier in November, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-defeats-proposal-to-prevent-911.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP02669:">amendment</a> [S AMDT 2669 materials] to an appropriations <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR02847:">bill</a> [HR 2847 materials] that would have prevented Guantanamo detainees accused of involvement in 9/11 from being tried in federal courts. In October, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-bill-allowing-transfer-of.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02892:">Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010</a> [HR 2892 materials], which allows for Guantanamo Bay detainees to be transferred to the US for prosecution and, among other provisions, requires certain information about each transferred detainee to be disclosed to Congress including costs, legal rationales, and possible risks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/129455.htm">Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp</a> [official profile; <a href="/pdf/jallohintro.pdf">introduction</a> by Professor Charles Jalloh, PDF] said Thursday that no US president is likely to present the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to the US Senate for ratification in the &quot;foreseeable future.&quot; Speaking at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Rapp said that while the US has an important role in international criminal justice, it is unlikely to join the ICC anytime soon. Rapp cited fears that US officials would be unfairly prosecuted and the US&#39;s strong national court system as reasons it would be difficult to overcome opposition to ratification. Rapp also said that the US has a role to play in a three-part system for ending international impunity. The US must work to strengthen national court systems, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the US must work with countries that exercise <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=universal+jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [JURIST news archive] when there is some relation between the country and the crime, and the US should continue to support the work of international criminal tribunals.<br /><br />In August, the Obama administration was urged by the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/obama-administration-urged-not-to-re.php">not to re-sign and ratify</a> [JURIST report] the Rome Statute. The study came in response to media reports that suggested the Obama administration might be considering joining the ICC. Earlier that month, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a visit to Kenya that it is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed1/idUSL6274568">&quot;great regret&quot;</a> [Reuters report] that the US is not a signatory to the ICC. The Rome Statute was approved in 1998, and the ICC was established in 2002. The US signed, but never ratified the treaty. Then-president George W. Bush later &quot;un-signed&quot; the treaty by notifying the UN that the US did not intend to ratify it. As of August 2009, only 110 of the 192 UN member states have ratified the treaty. Other states that have refused to ratify it include China, India, and Russia.

Last week, state-government agents began <a href="http://www.bmf.ch/en/news/?show=197">tearing down</a> [BMF report] Iban houses on land controlled by the native <a href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=MY&rop3=103933">Iban people</a> [backgrounder] at the request Tatau Land Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.assar.com.my/">ASSAR Group</a> [official website], a government-owned holding company seeking to develop the land. Between 25 and 30 houses were destroyed. The <a href="http://www.bintulu.org/news/2010/01/26/nor-nyawai-given-temporarily-injunction.php">injunction</a> [Bintulu report], issued Monday, prohibits Tatau Land and government agencies from entering the Iban land until at least February 9, when the court will conduct a full hearing.<br /><br />A number of indigenous people have attempted to assert land rights in recent years. In August, an indigenous Indonesian tribe <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/indonesia-tribe-sues-us-mining-company.php">sued a subsidiary</a> [JURIST report] of US mining company <a href="http://www.fcx.com/">Freeport-McRoRan Copper &amp; Gold</a> [corporate website], claiming it owned the land the company was mining. In May, the <a href="http://www.sapmi.se/">Swedish Sami Association</a> [advocacy website, in Swedish] brought a <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/indigenous-sami-people-file-suit.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Sweden&#39;s government, claiming the state was violating Sami hunting rights. In March, Brazil&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/brazil-high-court-grants-disputed-land.php">expelled 200 rice farmers</a> [JURIST report] from an area of land, ruling that the land belonged to indigenous peoples. In 2008, the New Zealand government and several Maori groups <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/new-zealand-parliament-signs-record.php">signed a deed of settlement</a> [JURIST report] worth nearly NZ $196 million to resolve certain indigenous claims concerning land taken by British settlers in the 19th century.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US immigration judge <a href="http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/Germany/201001260.asp">granted asylum</a> [press release] to a German family on Tuesday, ruling that Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/Germany/">laws against homeschooling</a> [HSLDA backgrounder] gave the family a well-founded fear of persecution. The Romeike family <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/26/AR2010012603298.html">fled Germany</a> [AP report] in 2008, two years after pulling their children out of German public school so that they could be homeschooled, and one year after a controversial German court ruling that social service workers could remove children from the home if the parents refused to send them to school. Judge Lawrence Burman&#39;s opinion was critical of German policy regarding educational freedom, calling the country&#39;s laws against homeschooling a violation of basic human rights. The case has caused <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,674312,00.html">controversy over religious persecution in Germany</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Der Spiegel</span> report], as the Romeikes claimed that German curriculum has turned against Christian values with the passage of time. It is not known if the US government will appeal the ruling.<br /><br />Unlike in Germany, homeschooling is legal and increasing in popularity in the US, with recent figures suggesting that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-04-homeschooling_N.htm">as many as 1.7 million children</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span> report] are homeschooled. Each state has its <a href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp">own homeschooling laws</a> [HSLDA backgrounder] with varying levels of regulatory scrutiny, ranging from no notice required to homeschool children to mandatory notification of achievement and compliance with state curriculum. Homeschooling was <a href="http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob13.html">outlawed in Germany in 1919</a> [constitution text], and the ban is enshrined within <a href="http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#7">article 7</a> [text] of the current constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>] called Wednesday for <a href="http://us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za/assets/articles/attachments/25468_sarkozy_en.pdf">strong banking regulations</a> [speech, PDF; <a href="http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20Press%20Releases/PR_AM10opening">press release</a>] to restore the &quot;moral dimensions&quot; of capitalism. Speaking at the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/en/events/AnnualMeeting2010/Thursday28/index.htm">World Economic Forum Annual Meeting</a> [official website] in Davos, Switzerland, Sarkozy called the current financial malaise a &quot;crisis of globalization.&quot; He promised to <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/wef/article7005342.ece">target trade imbalances</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report] between the East and West and called for a new <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/56dbb854-0c0b-11df-96b9-00144feabdc0.html">currency exchange system</a> [FT report] to prevent monetary dumping, as well as writing new laws to curb banks from <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sarkozy-lashes-out-at-bonuses-but-shows-support-for-brown-1881273.html">speculating</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span> report]. Sarkozy said:<br /><blockquote><br />The other question we can no longer avoid is that of the role banks must play in the economy. The banker&#39;s job is not to speculate, it is to analyse credit risk, assess the capacity of borrowers to repay their loans and finance growth of the economy. If financial capitalism went so wrong, it was, first and foremost, because many banks were no longer doing their job. Why take the risk of lending to entrepreneurs when it is so easy to earn money by speculating on the markets? Why lend only to those who can repay the loan when it is so easy to shift the risks off the balance sheet?<br /><br />President Obama is right when he says that banks must be dissuaded from engaging in proprietary speculation or financing speculative funds. But this debate cannot be confined to a single country, whatever its weight in global finance. This debate must be settled within the G20.<br /></blockquote><br />Sarkozy also called for &quot;invest[ing] massively in the technologies of the future that will drive the digital revolution and the ecological revolution.&quot;<br /><br />The US has recently taken several steps toward financial reform. Earlier this month, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/president-obama-proposes-new-banking.php">proposed new banking rules</a> [JURIST report] that he claims would stabilize the banking system and reduce the risk of future bank failures. The legislation would prohibit banks from owning, investing in, or sponsoring hedge funds, private equity funds, or proprietary trading funds for profit where the funds do not benefit the banks&#39; customers. In December, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would create a consumer protection agency, strengthen financial oversight and prohibit certain types of predatory and abusive lending. The US <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> to create a consumer financial protection agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving Obama&#39;s stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. In June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.

Russia is the last member of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] to ratify the protocol, which includes reforms to increase efficiency of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], such as filtering out inadmissible and repetitive cases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Canadian <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca">Office of the Privacy Commissioner</a> [official website] announced Thursday that it would <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/media/nr-c/2010/nr-c_100127_e.cfm">launch a new probe</a> [new release] of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website] to investigate privacy issues in response to a recent complaint. Facebook&#39;s privacy tool, which it introduced in December, requires users to review their privacy settings. The complaint alleges that these default privacy settings &quot;have made his information more readily available than the settings he had previously put in place.&quot; <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/aboutUs/bio_ed_e.cfm#contenttop">Elizabeth Denham</a> [official profile], the assistant privacy commissioner who led last year&#39;s investigation, noted that the complaint reflected concerns currently held by the office and reported to Facebook in recent months.<br /><br />In August, Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=118816">announced</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/facebook-announces-improved-user.php">report</a>] that it would give users more control over the private information they share through their profiles. The changes were announced after discussions with the Canadian privacy commissioner, who in July <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/cf-dc/2009/2009_008_0716_e.pdf">released a report</a> [text, PDF] that was critical of Facebook&#39;s compliance with Canadian privacy laws. Also in August, five Facebook users <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/facebook-sued-in-california-court-for.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a US federal court alleging that the site violates California privacy laws. In late July, Facebook announced it had <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10295120-245.html?tag=mncol;mlt_related.">corrected a loophole</a> [CNET report] whereby users could see strangers&#39; posted photos without those individuals&#39; knowledge. In February, Facebook, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/159703/facebook_privacy_change_sparks_federal_complaint.html">facing a federal complaint</a> [PC World report], reversed a change to its Terms of Use policy that gave Faceboook ownership of all information posted on a user&#39;s profile, even if the page were deleted.

Other PSC <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/851498/-/item/0/-/lpq6r0/-/index.html">proposals</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Nation</span> report] include an expanded parliament, with some seats guaranteed to women, a prohibition on members of parliament serving in cabinet positions to maintain a separation of powers, and a presidency that requires a candidate to receive a majority of the popular vote as well as at least a quarter of the vote in at least half the counties. The PSC will share its decisions with Kenya&#39;s <a href="http://www.coekenya.go.ke/">Committee of Experts on Constitutional Review</a> [official website] for it to consider.<br /><br />Last week, the PSC decided that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/kenya-lawmakers-refuse-to-include-equal.php">not recommend marriage rights</a> [JURIST report] for women equal to those of men. The first draft of the constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/kenya-committee-unveils-new-draft.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] in November. The changes are intended to reduce the widespread injustice throughout the country, and specifically address issues that led to violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">2007 presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October, former UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/annan.php">news archive</a>] called for constitutional reform in Kenya before the next electoral cycle begins in 15 months. In 2007, tens of thousands of protesters took to Kenya&#39;s streets accusing <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] of election fraud after early opinion polls suggested rival <a href="http://www.raila07.com/">Raila Odinga</a> [campaign website] was in the lead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said Wednesday that strengthening human rights is an <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/SKEA-824EEY/$File/full_report.pdf">integral part of the rebuilding process</a> [statement, PDF] in Haiti. In her remarks, Pillay mentioned the role that the inhumane living conditions may have had in the high casualty numbers resulting from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/info/haiti-earthquake-2010/">January 12 earthquake</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">news archive</a>], placing blame on the Duvalier regime for those conditions. According to Pillay, the high number of casualties could have been predicted by the damage sustained in that country following a series of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/10/04/haiti.missing.floods.storms/index.html">tropical storms in 2008</a> [CNN report]. Pillay concluded her remarks with a call to action, saying:<br /><blockquote><br />As the Secretary-General noted we must help Haiti build back better. This also entails re-constructing and strengthening the national human rights protection systems through an effective and independent judiciary and a law enforcement apparatus respectful of human rights. A reliable National Human Rights Institution and a vigilant civil society must be empowered to be active partners in this endeavour.<br /></blockquote><br />Pillay also urged the rule of law to be reestablished, citing fears that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-inmates-escape-collapsed-prison.php">escaped prisoners</a> [JURIST report] would engage in violent criminal activities.<br /><br />Last week, US President Barack Obama signed a bill that will allow US citizens to claim donations to Haitian relief efforts as a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-approves-tax-benefit-for-haiti.php">deduction on their 2009 tax returns</a> [JURIST report]. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said that Haitian nationals present in the US before the earthquake will be given temporary protected status and will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">not be deported for the next 18 months</a>, but Haitian refugees who arrive in the US illegally will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-earthquake-refugees-may-not.php">sent back to their home country</a> [JURIST reports]. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake caused massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti, and the death toll has been estimated at 150,000.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/28/cambodia-opposition-leader-sam-rainsy-s-trial-farce">called</a> [press release] the closed door trial of Cambodia&#39;s opposition leader <a href="http://www.samrainsyparty.org/about/about_sam_rainsy.htm">Sam Rainsy</a> [official profile] and two others a &quot;farce,&quot; saying the ruling demonstrates the government&#39;s control over the country&#39;s judiciary. Rainsy was <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/jail-01272010135706.html">convicted</a> [RFA report] Wednesday, in <span style="font-style:italic;">absentia</span>, of inciting racial discrimination and intentionally destroying posts demarcating the border between Cambodia and Vietnam. Two villagers were convicted of the same crimes. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams said the decision was the result of political motivations by Cambodia&#39;s <a href="http://www.cambodia.gov.kh/unisql1/egov/english/premier.biography.html">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [official profile]:<br /><blockquote><br />The Cambodian government&#39;s relentless crackdown on critics continues apace in 2010. Hun Sen seems intent on reversing the political pluralism that has been created over the past two decades. Any hopes of slowing Hun Sen&#39;s assault on the political opposition now depends on the donor community, which props up the government financially. This political trial should make donors recognize the gravity of the situation.<br /></blockquote><br />Rainsy was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 8 million riels (approximately USD $2,000), and the two villagers were each sentenced to one year in prison. All three were required to pay 55 million riels (approximately USD $13,000) for destroying the border markings.<br /><br />The charges stem from an <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010012931248/National-news/sam-rainsy-unveils-border-proof.html">incident</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> report] in October where Rainsy joined Cambodian villagers in removing six temporary border markers, which the villagers said were placed on their lands by Vietnamese authorities. Rainsy called the planting of the border markers a border incursion and said his conviction was requested by Vietnamese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5119642.stm">Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung</a> [BBC profile]. Rainsy was stripped of his parliamentary immunity in November, and an arrest warrant was issued for him in December after he failed to appear for questioning about the incident. He has said he would return to the country and allow himself to be taken into custody if the two villagers are released from prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Hundreds of judges in Italy walked out of their courtrooms Saturday, in protest over judicial reform legislation proposed by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>]. The legislation, which has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Italian Senate</a> [official website, in Italian], aims to shorten the trial and appeals process by putting strict time limits on its duration. The protests were <a href="http://www.associazionemagistrati.it/public/File/comunicato27gen10.pdf">organized</a> [press release, PDF; in Italian] by the <a href="http://www.associazionemagistrati.it/">National Magistrates Association</a> (ANM) [official website, in Italian] on Wednesday and took place at ceremonies marking the beginning of the judicial year. Judges all across Italy, including Milan, Naples, Palermo, and Rome, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8489253.stm">got up and walked out</a> [BBC report] carrying a copy of the Italian Constitution as government officials began to speak. According to the ANM, judges are <a href="http://www.associazionemagistrati.it/public/File/Intermagistrature_processobreve20gen10.pdf">concerned</a> [press release, PDF; in Italian] that the reforms would act as a <em>de facto</em> amnesty for persons accused of crimes committed prior to May 2, 2006 and would endanger future trials. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34502.htm">bill</a> [S 1880 materials, in Italian] approved by the Senate would limit the three stages of a case - trial, initial appeal, and final appeal - to between 6.5 and 10 years depending on the crime, and cases that exceed the time limit would end in an automatic acquittal of the defendant. Because of the bill&#39;s retroactive effect, two pending <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-court-again-postpones-berlusconi.php">corruption cases</a> [JURIST report] against Berlusconi himself would be automatically dismissed. Members of Berlusconi&#39;s center-right coalition have defended the bill as a way to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6995720.ece">speed up</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report] the slow Italian justice system while his critics have called it an <em>ad personam</em> bill, passed by his allies to help Berlusconi with his <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d7042fe-05e7-11df-8c97-00144feabdc0.html">legal troubles</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</span> report]. The bill would become law if it is approved by the lower house <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> and signed by <a href="http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official websites, in Italian].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Friday ordered the federal government to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-sets-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-target-federal-operations">reduce</a> [press release] its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greenhouse+gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST news archive] by 28 percent by 2020. The reduction is pursuant to <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-24518.pdf">Executive Order 13514</a> [text, PDF], signed by Obama in October. The order provides, in part:<br /><blockquote><br />It is therefore the policy of the United States that Federal agencies shall increase energy efficiency; measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect activities; conserve and protect water resources through efficiency, reuse, and stormwater management; eliminate waste, recycle, and prevent pollution; leverage agency acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable technologies and environmentally preferable materials, products, and services; design, construct, maintain, and operate high performance sustainable buildings in sustainable locations; strengthen the vitality and livability of the communities in which Federal facilities are located; and inform Federal employees about and involve them in the achievement of these goals.<br /></blockquote><br />The White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/">Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)</a> [official website] will be responsible for implementing the initiatives outlined in the order at the agency and departmental levels.<br /><br />Obama&#39;s announcement comes a month after the <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/Climate-Energy/COP15-Copenhagen-2009/cop15.htm">UN Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] in Copenhagen. Although the conference <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/no-legally-binding-agreement-on-climate.php">failed to produce any legally binding resolution</a> [JURIST report], 192 countries, including the US, agreed to &quot;take note&quot; of the non-binding <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf">Cophenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF]. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=climate+change+">Climate change</a> [JURIST archive] has been a central policy concern of the Obama administration since taking office. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] announced a finding that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">greenhouse gases threaten</a> [JURIST report] public health and the environment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chief Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE60R0OI20100128?sp=true">said</a> [Reuters report] Thursday that he believes the ICC&#39;s appeals chamber will add a genocide charge to the case against Sudanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>]. The chamber <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/F4AD511B-B9C4-4BEF-A481-AB6EBA6097CE.htm">will rule</a> [press release] next Wednesday on an <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-prosecutors-appeal-decision-not-to.php">appeal</a> challenging the ICC&#39;s decision not to include a count of genocide in its March <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] for al-Bashir on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court found insufficient evidence to support the additional charge at the time, though Moreno-Ocampo argued that the evidentiary standards imposed by the pre-trial chamber in advance of the March indictment were an improper interpretation of <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/5.htm">Article 58</a> of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [texts]. Al-Bashir has denied all accusations, and will seek re-election in April.<br /><br />The warrant was met with mixed reactions, with some believing that its enforcement would <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-war-crimes-warrant-met.php">jeopardize peacekeeping efforts</a> [JURIST report] in Sudan.  The <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> [official website] reversed its initial opposition to the warrant, later <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/african-union-panel-recommends.php">recommending cooperation</a> [JURIST report] on the principle that those sought by international courts should be required to face the charges against them.  Al-Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-bashir-derides-icc.php">scoffed</a> [JURIST report] at the warrant upon its issuance, saying that it represents an effort by Western countries to reassert colonial power over Sudan, and criticized the ICC for failing to take action in conflicts in Iraq and the Gaza Strip.  He is accused of leading the systematic harassment and murder of members of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa ethnic groups under the pretext of counter-insurgency since 2003.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] Friday <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/136273.htm">dismissed</a> [transcript; <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/01/136277.htm">press release</a>] two Russian proposals for new European security treaties and reaffirmed US commitment to &quot;unified&quot; European security. In prepared remarks delivered at the L&#8217;Ecole Militaire in Paris, Clinton said:<blockquote>the Russian Government under President Medvedev has put forth proposals for new security treaties in Europe. Indivisibility of security is a key feature of those proposals... However, we believe that these common goals are best pursued in the context of existing institutions, such as the OSCE and the NATO-Russia Council, rather than by negotiating new treaties, as Russia has suggested...</blockquote> Clinton also affirmed that American troops will continue to be stationed in Europe as part of American commitment to European security, while casting the occasion as an &quot;extraordinary opportunity to work together&quot; with Russia on security.<br /><br />In recent months, Russia has campaigned to gain a greater say in security issues with both the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] and the United States. On Tuesday, the parties of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) <a href="http://www.nato.int/ims/news/2010/n100126a-e.html">agreed</a> [press release] on the &quot;NRC-MR Framework for NATO-Russia Military-to-Military Cooperation&quot; that will set the agenda for working out details on military cooperation. Last week, Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bul_ns_en.nsf/kartaflat/en03.01">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6242774.stm">profile</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-foreign-minister-says-us-nuclear.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that negotiations on nuclear arms reduction would likely resume in early February to draft a new treaty to succeed the 1991 <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [text]. In November, the Kremlin <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2009/1221/Move-over-NATO-Russia-pushes-new-security-treaty-for-Europe">proposed</a> [<em>Christian Science Monitor</em> report] a <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/text/docs/2009/11/223072.shtml">treaty</a> [text] with NATO that would require consultation between all members on European security issues, and that analysts decried as a proposal to give Russia veto power over NATO affairs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French public prosecutor on Friday announced plans to appeal the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-court-acquits-ex-pm-of-sarkozy.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2768503.stm">Dominique de Villepin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Villepin">news archive</a>], which cleared him of all charges for his role in an alleged plot to defame several businessmen, including current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>]. The appeal comes shortly after Sarkozy announced that he would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/world/europe/29france.html">not appeal</a> [NYT report] the verdict. According to French Media Advisor Franck Louvrier, prosecutors were not given instructions from the president, and Sarkozy will <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/01/29/clearstream-le-parquet-va-faire-appel-de-la-relaxe-de-villepin_1298378_3224.html">not be a civil party to the appeal</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Le Monde</font> report, in French].<br /><br />In October, de Villepin denied breaking the law and claimed that Sarkozy <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-prosecutors-recommend-ex-pm-get.php">ordered the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] for personal and political reasons. De Villepin and his alleged co-conspirators <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-ex-pm-goes-on-trial-for-sarkozy.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] last September. In November 2008, de Villepin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/france-ex-pm-indicted-in-defamation.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for his connection with the long-running political scandal known as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4965734.stm">Clearstream Affair</a> [BBC backgrounder]. De Villepin&#39;s political image was tainted by the allegations as well as by his advance of an unpopular <a href="/currentawareness/cpe.php">youth labor law</a> [JURIST news archive] during his time as prime minister.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/house/house.asp">Hawaii House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Friday postponed indefinitely a vote on <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/bills/HB444_SD1_.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] that would have allowed persons in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive] the same rights as married heterosexual couples. The postponement was decided by voice vote; only a two-thirds majority in the Hawaii House would allow further action on the bill. In the weeks leading to the vote, the <a href="http://www.hawaiifamilyforum.org/index.php">Hawaii Family Forum</a> and the <a href="http://www.catholichawaii.org/">Hawaii Catholic Conference</a> [advocacy websites] had <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/527783.html?nav=10">rallied</a> [<em>Maui News</em> report] in a campaign against the civil union bill. Gay rights organization Equality Hawai&#39;i characterized the voice vote result as a &quot;cowardly move&quot; <a href="http://eqfed.org/familyequalityhi/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=37569035">motivated</a> [press release] by &quot;election considerations,&quot; and decried the use of the procedure, which avoids having to record the specific vote of each legislator.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/senate/senate.asp">Hawaii Senate</a> [official website] had <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/527783.html?nav=10">voted</a> [JURIST report] 18-7 only last week in favor of <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/bills/HB444_SD1_.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] allowing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive]. The state of Hawaii has been at the forefront of the gay rights movement <a href="http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=292">since the 1990s</a> [timeline]. In 1993, a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAkQFDAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.courts.state.hi.us%2F&rct=j&q=hawaii+supreme+court&ei=Z8RkS6m2EZOZ8Aam0JmSAw&usg=AFQjCNFjHEPOPnVdjkcv-Lwx1Yrd4EA7xQ">Hawaii Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/hawaii.php">ruled</a> that the state must show compelling reason to deny same-sex marriage. In 1998, Hawaiian voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to reserve for the State Legislature the authority to define marriage. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, and is set to become legal in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports], pending Congressional inaction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during an <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1001/31/sotu.01.html">interview</a> [transcript] Sunday on CNN&#39;s <em>State of the Union</em> that upon being tried and convicted, alleged 9/11 conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] would likely be executed. Gibbs stressed that the heinous nature of the crime he is accused of merits such severe punishment.  When asked about the increasingly-unclear location of the trial Gibbs said the focus was still to have the trial in New York:<BLOCKQUOTE>We are talking with the authorities in New York. We understand their logistical concerns and their security concerns that are involved. We have been discussing that with them.<br /><br />As you know, they were originally supportive of this. We want to see this man tried and brought to justice in the place in which the crime was committed. We will work with them and come to a solution that we think we bring about justice for those that lost loved ones on such a horrific day on 9/11. </BLOCKQUOTE> Earlier this week, New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.e985cf5219821bc3f7393cd401c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/nyc-mayor-asks-federal-government-to.php">cited</a> [JURIST report] costs and potential disruptions to the lives of New Yorkers in urging the federal government to move the trials. Bloomberg said a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h8krg3Dia3yco5LDiSNV2CXZGvsg">military base may be a more appropriate venue</a> [AFP report] for the trial since they are generally in secluded areas, though he said his request was not based on security concerns. Bloomberg originally backed the idea of trying some of the terrorists held at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in Manhattan due to its proximity to ground zero and the symbolic significance of convicting the suspects there. In light of criticism, the Obama administration has reportedly been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-administration-considering-moving.php">considering</a> [JURIST report] other locations but has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35168785/ns/us_news-security/">not yet decided on a specific alternative venue</a> [MSNBC report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US Department of Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> (OLC) [official website] lawyers <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty/jay-bybee.html">Jay Bybee</a> [academic profile] have been cleared of allegations of wrongdoing in relation to their controversial memos asserting the legality of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive], it was reported Friday. The results of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opr/">Office of Professional Responsibility</a> (OPR) [official website] investigation of the two former OLC lawyers have yet to be officially released, but the probe is <a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/declassified/archive/2010/01/29/holder-under-fire.aspx">reported</a> [<em>Newsweek</em> report] to have concluded that the lawyers exercised poor judgment in crafting the 2002 memos, a finding that does not qualify as professional misconduct. Originally, the OPR investigation had concluded that Yoo and Bybee had violated their professional obligations in crafting the memos, but this finding was softened by the reviewer. The implications of the original findings would have been far reaching, and could have led to significant sanctions against the former officials. Yoo, now a professor at the <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/index.html">University of California Berkeley School of Law</a> [official website], could have faced disbarment. Bybee, now a judge on the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], could have faced impeachment proceedings. <br /><br />A report prepared in the final months of the Bush administration came to similar conclusions, but was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/30/AR2010013001411.html?hpid=topnews">returned</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] to the OPR for further investigation by then Attorney General Michael Mukasey. The five-year statute of limitations on Yoo&#39;s alleged misconduct lapsed shortly after. In June, a judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a private lawsuit against Yoo could proceed. Judge Jeffrey White refused to dismiss a lawsuit brought by convicted terrorist <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> [JURIST news archive] that claims Yoo&#39;s legal opinions endorsing enhanced interrogation techniques led to Padilla&#39;s torture. Yoo has appealed the decision. The ruling was the first time a judge has allowed a lawsuit to proceed against a government lawyer for his opinion in the <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">interrogation memos</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in April <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">released four of the memos</a> [JURIST report] from the OLC outlining controversial CIA interrogation techniques and their legal rationale in response to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text] lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] during the Bush administration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The White House is considering moving the trials of alleged 9/11 conspirator <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] and other high-profile terror suspects out of New York City, a senior official said Friday. Although the deputy press secretary <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/gaggle-deputy-press-secretary-bill-burton-aboard-air-force-one-en-route-tampa-flori">reaffirmed</a> [transcript] earlier this week that US President Barack Obama &quot;agrees with the Attorney General&#39;s opinion that ... he and others can be litigated successfully and securely in the United States of America, just like others have,&quot; the administration is now considering <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29terror.html?scp=1&sq=9/11%20trial&st=cse">moving the trial</a> [NYT report] after strong local opposition. Earlier this week, New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.e985cf5219821bc3f7393cd401c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official profile] cited costs and potential disruptions to the lives of New Yorkers in urging the federal government to move the trials. Bloomberg reiterated that position Friday, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/media/2010/01-29-10-worrs.mp3">saying</a> [recorded audio, MP3] that &quot;it would be phenomenally expensive and it is very disruptive to people who live in the area and businesses in the area ... and it would be better to do it elsewheres [sic] if they could find a venue.&quot;<br /><br />In November, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-defends-911-federal-trials.php">appeared before the Senate</a> to defend <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">plans</a> [JURIST reports] to try Mohammed, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ramzi">Ramzi Bin Al Shibh</a> [JURIST news archive], Walid Bin Attash, Ali Abdul-Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Al Hawsaw in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Earlier in November, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-defeats-proposal-to-prevent-911.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP02669:">amendment</a> [S AMDT 2669 materials] to an appropriations <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR02847:">bill</a> [HR 2847 materials] that would have prevented Guantanamo detainees accused of involvement in 9/11 from being tried in federal courts. In October, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-bill-allowing-transfer-of.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02892:">Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010</a> [HR 2892 materials], which allows for Guantanamo Bay detainees to be transferred to the US for prosecution and, among other provisions, requires certain information about each transferred detainee to be disclosed to Congress including costs, legal rationales, and possible risks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2010/2010scc3/2010scc3.html">ruled</a> [judgment text] Friday that while the treatment of Canadian Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] violated his rights, the government does not have to press for his return to Canada. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the interrogation of Khadr by Canadian officials while in detention violated <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. According to the ruling, Canadian officials questioned Khadr, who was captured at age 15, even though they knew he was being indefinitely detained, and, in March 2004, he was questioned with knowledge that he was subjected to three weeks sleep deprivation by US authorities. Still, the court said that forcing the government to press for his return was not an appropriate remedy. The court reasoned that ordering such a remedy would overreach its authority by not respecting the power of the executive to act on issues of foreign affairs. The Canadian chapter of <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/index.php?src=redir">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/resource_centre/news/view.php?load=arcview&article=5142&c=Resource+Centre+News">urged</a> [press release] the government to exercise its authority to remedy the violations of Khadr&#39;s constitutional rights:<br /><blockquote><br />Amnesty International is calling on the Canadian government to respond immediately to today&#39;s unanimous Supreme Court of Canada declaration that Omar Khadr&#39;s rights have been violated. As a remedy to those violations, Amnesty International continues to call on the Canadian government immediately to seek Omar Khadr&#39;s repatriation from Guantanamo Bay back to Canada.<br /></blockquote><br />It is unclear how the government will respond to Friday&#39;s ruling.<br /><br />Friday&#39;s ruling overturned a <a href="http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml">Federal Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/canada-court-affirms-order-mandating.php">decision</a>, which upheld a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/canada-court-orders-pm-to-request.php">order</a> [JURIST reports] requiring the federal government to seek Khadr&#39;s repatriation. The federal government immediately <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/canada-government-to-appeal-khadr.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the ruling to the Supreme Court. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] said in November that Khadr will <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/khadr-likely-to-face-military.php">likely be tried</a> [JURIST report] by a US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October, Khadr&#39;s military lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-military-judge-replaces-khadr.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] and replaced with civilian lawyers by a US military judge on Khadr&#39;s request after court affidavits showed the lawyer&#39;s performance had become detrimental to his defense. Khadr has allegedly admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/khadr-admitted-throwing-grenade-that.php">throwing a hand grenade</a> that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan, and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

The jury found that Vivendi SA had made <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-30/vivendi-found-liable-on-all-57-counts-in-investors-class-suit.html">material misstatements</a> [Bloomberg report] regarding its financial health in 2001-2002 before a three-way merger with Seagram Co. and <a href="http://www.canalplus.fr/">Canal Plus</a> [corporate website, in French], and that investors who brought stock relying on those misstatements later lost money after its stock price fell.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2078564.stm">Jean-Marie Messier</a> [BBC profile], Vivendi SA&#39;s former CEO, and Guillaume Hannezo, the former finance director, were found not liable by the same jury. Vivendi SA has said that it will <a href="http://www.vivendi.com/vivendi/Vivendi-Will-Appeal-to-Overturn">appeal</a> [press release] the verdict. The company said:<blockquote>Vivendi believes that there are many grounds for appeal, including, but not limited to the Court&#8217;s decision to include French shareholders in the class, its rulings on jurisdiction and the plaintiffs&#8217; erroneous method of proving and calculating damages, as well as the numerous incorrect rulings made during the course of the trial. Furthermore, Vivendi believed, and continues to believe strongly, that it did nothing wrong and that this case raises significant legal issues for foreign corporations doing business in the United States that need to be definitively resolved.</blockquote><a href="http://abbeyspanier.com/partners.shtml">Arthur Abbey</a> [firm profile], a plaintiff&#39;s attorney with <a href="http://abbeyspanier.com/index.html">Abbey, Spanier, Rodd and Abrams</a> [official website] who litigated the case, said that Vivendi might ultimately have to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/01/29/viva-vivendi-new-york-plaintiffs-firms-score-huge-verdict/">pay out</a> [WSJ report] between four and nine billion dollars in damages.<br /><br />Messier, the former CEO, had earlier <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-vivendi30-2010jan30,0,3978131.story">testified</a> [LAT report; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=avofEAtU5L3I&pos=7">report</a>] that the fall in stock price was not due to securities fraud but because of the then economic climate. In 2003, Vivendi paid a 50 million dollar fine to the<a href="http://www.sec.gov/"> Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] to settle the complaint. Messier paid a one million dollar fine and  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/business/vivendi-pays-50-million-in-settlement-with-sec.html?pagewanted=1">agreed</a> [NYT report] to give up his claim to a 26 million dollar severance payment.  Vivendi had previously <a href="/paperchase/2004/01/vivendi-withdraws-lawsuit-against.htm">sued</a> [JURIST report] Messier to recover the severance payment, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/01/business/arbitrators-say-vivendi-owes-messier-23.4-million.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">claiming</a> [NYT report] that board members had been coerced by Messier into signing off on the payment, but later withdrew its lawsuit as part of the settlement with the SEC

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Nigerian court ruled Friday that ailing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile] is not required to formally transfer his powers to <a href="http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/LinksReadPrint.asp?blurb=640">Vice President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [Online Nigeria profile] or any other interim leader. The Federal High Court in Abuja <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8487474.stm">rejected</a> [BBC report] a lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.nigerianbar.org/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [official website], seeking to have presidential powers temporary endowed in Jonathan pursuant to Article 145 of <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Nigeria&#39;s Constitution</a> [text]. Last week, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/nigeria-court-orders-cabinet-to-pass.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Nigeria&#39;s cabinet to pass a resolution within 14 days on whether Yar&#39;Adua is capable of running the country. Earlier this month, a judge for Nigeria&#39;s Federal High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/nigeria-court-rules-vp-may-take.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Jonathan to assume executive powers in Yar&#39;Adua&#39;s absence. Yar&#39;Adua has been receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia since late November<br /><br />In 2008, the Nigerian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/nigeria-high-court-upholds-contested.php">upheld</a> the results of <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-ruling-party-wins-poll-but-eu.php">disputed 2007 election</a> that brought Yar&#39;Adua to power, despite opposition groups&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. Yar&#39;Adua had promised to step down if the court invalidated the election. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-creates-election-tribunal-ahead.php">tribunal</a> [JURIST report] formed before the 2007 election to deal with allegations of fraud ruled that the opposition groups lacked enough evidence of fraud to have the results overturned.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French Prime Minister <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/premier-ministre/francois-fillon-premier-ministre">Francois Fillon</a> [official profile, in French] has asked the country&#39;s highest court, the <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/">State Council</a> [official website, in French], for input on implementing a proposed law that would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJnBFqCUCPypssucXFgV1T99T6TA">ban</a> [AFP report] public wearing of the burqa, the <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=117428&sectionid=351020603">full Islamic veil</a> [Press TV report]. In a letter to <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/fr/jean-marc-sauve-1-kxj/">Jean-Marc Sauve</a> [official profile, in French], the Vice-Chairman of the State Council, Fillon <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/premier-ministre/le-premier-ministre-demande-au-conseil-d-etat-d-etudier-les-solutions-juridiques-po">ordered</a> [text, in French] the Council to &quot;study legal solutions to achieve a ban, that is as wide as possible, on wearing the full veil&quot;  while addressing legal concerns that other members of the National Assembly had.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Vietnamese court sentenced writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to a four-year prison term on Friday on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. Foreign observers were not permitted to attend the trial, which took place in the city of Haiphong in the northern region of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vietnam">Vietnam</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j7SI_3W7B7RZPJ6HHoLMSB8FzeCA">lasted less than a day</a> [AFP report]. Nghien was sentenced under Vietnam&#39;s Penal Code <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/vn/legis/pc66/s88.html">Article 88</a> [text], which provides for up to 20 years in prison for crimes including &quot;propagating against&quot; the government or &quot;circulating documents ... with contents against&quot; the government. Convictions under Article 88 have been <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA41/005/2009/en/ead22bde-8759-41f3-a8b3-78ebb51ea409/asa410052009en.html">criticized</a> [press release] by groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], which calls the law &quot;vaguely worded&quot; and accuses authorities of a &quot;long history of using its sweeping provisions to silence voices they deem unacceptable.&quot;<br /><br />Nghien is the latest in a string of dissidents to be convicted for anti-government activities. Last week, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion in a one-day trial. Prominent human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive], Le Thang Long, and Nguyen Tien Trung were given prison sentences between 5-7 years, and Internet entrepreneur Tran Huynh Duy Thuc received a 16-year sentence. Dinh was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/vietnam-pro-democracy-lawyer-arrested.php">originally charged</a> [JURIST report] with spreading propaganda under Article 88, but was eventually convicted of the more serious crime of subversion. Last month, pro-democracy dissident <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">Tran Anh Kim was also sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion. In 2009, two Vietnamese newspaper editors were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/vietnam-newspaper-editors-dismissed-for.php">dismissed from their jobs</a> for protesting the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/vietnam-journalists-charged-with.php">arrests of two journalists</a> [JURIST reports] who reported on government corruption. The arrested reporters, accused of &quot;abusing freedom and democracy,&quot; were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/vietnam-journalist-sentenced-to-two.php">sentenced</a> to two years of prison and &quot;re-education&quot; for reporting on the so-called <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/vietnam-ex-officials-on-trial-on.php">PMU 18 corruption scandal</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] will begin an inquiry into the suspected torture and ill-treatment of detainees held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], Spanish media <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Garzon/investigara/Guantanamo/constar/causas/abiertas/EE/UU/elpepiesp/20100130elpepinac_7/Tes">reported</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report] Saturday. The inquiry follows claims made by several Spanish groups - including the Association for the Dignity of Prisoners of Spain, the <a href="http://www.nodo50.org/ala/spip/index.php">Free Association of Lawyers</a>, the <a href="http://www1.izquierda-unida.es/">United Left</a> and the <a href="http://www.apdhe.org/">Human Rights Association of Spain</a> [advocacy websites, in Spanish] - about alleged torture, abuse, inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees at the facility. The Obama administration has not responded to Garzon&#39;s questions regarding the open investigation of detainee abuses at the facility. Garzon&#39;s inquiry has focused on Spanish citizen and ex-Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/05/spain.terror.conviction/index.html">Ahmed Abderraman Hamed</a> [CNN report], and three others who Garzon has stated have significant connections with Spain. The domestic focus is due to new Spanish laws on the exercise of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by Spain&#39;s parliament in November. The new law limits the use of universal jurisdiction to offenses committed by or against Spaniards, or where the perpetrators are in Spain.<br /><br />Garzon has been known for using universal jurisdiction extensively in the past to bring several high-profile cases, including those against <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives]. In March, he <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-judge-weighing-probe-of-us.php">asked prosecutors to examine</a> [JURIST report] the US lawyers reportedly behind the establishment of the Guantanamo Bay detention center, including David Addington, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">John Yoo</a> [JURIST news archive], and former attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4001393.stm">Alberto Gonzales</a> [BBC profile]. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-court-assigns-new-judge-to-probe.php">reassigned</a> [JURIST report] to another judge the following month. The continued inquiry comes as US President Barack Obama prepares to close the detention facility. It was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/task-force-recommends-trials-or.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that 35 Guantanamo detainees now face trial or military commissions, adding to the five detainees that are already scheduled to be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in New York</a> for the 9/11 attacks and six detainees who have been chosen to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-guantanamo-detainee-referred-to.php">face military tribunals</a> [JURIST reports].
