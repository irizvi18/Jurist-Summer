The <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> (ADF) [advocacy website], a Christian legal advocacy group, had filed an <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/petition-filed-to-halt-same-sex-wedding-ceremonies.php">emergency petition</a> [JURIST report]] on Saturday arguing that the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] erred in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ninth-circuit-lifts-californias-ban-on-same-sex-marriages.php">dissolving the stay</a> [JURIST report] that had blocked the ruling striking down Proposition 8. Kennedy offered no explanation for rejecting the request. California now joins 12 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing same-sex marriages.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last Wednesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that Proposition 8 supporters lacked standing to appeal the district court's order striking down Proposition 8. When Proposition 8 was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by US District Judge Vaughn Walker, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current Governor Jerry Brown, who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to continue to defend the law and appeal the ruling. Wednesday's 5-4 opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling, in a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/planned-parenthood-sues-over-kansas-abortion-law.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] brought by Planned Parenthood, follows a ruling by a state court judge on Friday, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/28/abortion-law-kansas-brownback/2474507/">blocking that provision</a> [AP report]. US District Judge Kathryn Vratil <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2013/06/30/4322884/federal-judge-refuses-to-block.html">cited that ruling</a> [AP report] in refusing to block the provision, finding that Planned Parenthood would not face irreparable injury. The state court judge also blocked provisions on emergency procedures but declined to block portions banning sex-selective abortions and tax breaks for abortion providers. The remainder of the law takes effect Monday.

<p>A number of states have recently passed laws relating to <a href="/feature/2013/06/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">signed a measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the Arkansas <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." That law has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">blocked by a federal judge</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Habre has been under house arrest in Senegal since 2005. Senegal and the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/senegal-adopts-law-creating-special-tribunal-for-former-chad-dictator.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] in December to set up the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/113271">Extraordinary African Chambers</a> [statute, in French] to try Habre for allegations of crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture during his time in power between 1982 and 1990, in which rights groups report that some 40,000 people were killed. Habre's lawyer said that Habre was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23119658">taken from his home</a> [BBC report] in Dakar Sunday to an unknown location in preparation for his trial.

<p>Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre. In March 2012 lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium. In July 2011 Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision to deport Habre</a> [JURIST report] back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned of possible torture. That month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay Habre's deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death <em>in absentia</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google has scanned more than 20 million books after partnering in 2004 with major libraries around the world, and millions were scanned without consent of the authors, leading the number of the infringed class to be in the thousands. Permitting a class action lawsuit would let the Authors Guild, an association of authors and one of the plaintiffs in the case against Google, to sue as a group rather than individually. The Second Circuit ruled that <Judge Denny Chin of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] prematurely certified the class without first deciding if the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">"fair use"</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] defense under US copyright law allowed Google to display snippets of books, which could render the question of whether plaintiffs may be certified as a class moot. The case was remanded back to Chin for consideration of the "fair use" issue.

<p>In March 2011 Chin <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">rejected</a> an amended class action settlement agreement that was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">reached in 2008</a> between Google and the plaintiffs, who brought the <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/writers-group-sues-google-for.php">copyright suit</a> [JURIST reports] in 2005. The settlement agreement stated that Google would pay $125 million to the authors and publishers of copyrighted works in exchange for the permission to display up to 20 percent of the work online. The court reasoned that the settlement agreement would allow Google too much rights to exploit copyrighted works in the future. This ruling came a month after Chin <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] it because he was not ready.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The traders Zvi Goffer, Craig Drimal and Michael Kimelman, along with non-party defendants, conducted a double-blind, high-volume insider trading network that led the participants to acquire over $10 million in profits. Kimelman, an attorney who co-founded trading firm Incremental Capital with Goffer along with brother Emanuel Goffer, received a two-and-a-half-year prison term in October 2011. Drimal, who worked for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=galleon">Galleon Group</a> [JURIST news archives], was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison in August 2011 after pleading guilty. Goffer, who was considered the leader of the conspiracy, was sentenced to 10 years, the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-insidertrading-appeal-20130701,0,2442220.story">third-longest US sentence for insider trading</a> [Reuters report]. Although the court upheld Goffer's sentence, it said an order requiring him to forfeit more than $10 million be recalculated.

<p>The Second Circuit last week also <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-hedge-fund-managers-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the 2011 insider trading conviction of Galleon's hedge fund founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive], who is serving an 11-year sentence. Rajaratnam's case has been called the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history, and his sentence is the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/October11/rajaratnamrajsentencingpr.pdf">longest term ever imposed for insider trading</a> [DOJ press release]. The 11-year sentence was significantly lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the 19 1/2-year minimum indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence. Several other defendants from leading international companies have <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty in connection with the case</a> [JURIST report]. His younger brother, Rengan Rajaratnam, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/brother-of-imprisoned-hedge-fund-managers-pleads-not-guilty-to-insider-trading.php">convicted in March</a> [JURIST report] on related charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Grand Criminal Court's Third Chamber acquitted the two officers of all charges due to the lack of adequate evidence that the officers engaged in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/201112305416407787.html">torture of two female and four male doctors</a> [Al Jazeera report] in March 2011. Both officers, one being Bahraini princess <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21149779">Noura Bint Ebrahim al-Khalifa</a> [BBC report] who serves in Bahrain's Drugs Control Unit, denied the charges. Prosecutor Nawaf Hamza will <a href="http://www.wam.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&cid=1290005408353&pagename=WAM%2FWAM_E_Layout&parent=Query&parentid=1135099399852">appeal the decision</a> [ENA report] if they find error in the court's reasoning.    

<p>The anti-government protests in early 2011 have spurred numerous legal proceedings in Bahrain. In May a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bahrain-court-sentences-protesters-to-15-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 31 people to 15 years for their participation in firebomb attacks as part of anti-government protests. In March a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bahrain-court-reverses-convictions-for-21-medics-arrested-during-anti-government-protesters.php">reversed the convictions</a> [JURIST report] for 21 medics who were arrested at a hospital during the 2011 protests. The group of medics were originally charged with taking part in unauthorized demonstrations after treating protesters who were injured by police and have alleged that they were tortured and coerced into making confessions following their arrest. At least 28 medics were charged, but most of the sentences have been overturned. However, in October of last year, the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] issued to nine medics for allegedly participating in anti-government protests. In November King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission</a> [JURIST report] to make recommendations after the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) concluded in a report that Bahraini authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">used excessive force</a> [JURIST report] and tortured detained protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The provisions will require ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion, make it more difficult for family planning services to obtain funding, and limit the ability of those providing abortions to make agreements with local hospitals. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/">Planned Parenthood Action Fund</a> [advocacy website] condemned Kasich's decision to "bury" the stringent provisions in a multipage budget bill, saying "politicians in Ohio knew they couldn't pass these unpopular measures if they played by the rules." The President of Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards <a href="http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-action-fund-condemns-anti-womens-health-budget-signed-governor-john-kasich/">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The fight in Ohio is not over, with extreme bills still pending in the legislature.  As long as politicians continue to introduce out-of-touch bills that further restrict women's health care in Ohio, we will fight for Ohio women.  We are all better off when women and their doctors, not politicians, are the ones making medical decisions.</blockquote>The bill was signed just a few days after Texas state Senator Wendy Davis was able to successfully filibuster against proposed anti-abortion laws in her home state <a href="http://rt.com/usa/wendy-davis-texas-abortion-496/">in front of a crowds of supporters</a> [RT report] from across the country.

<p>Also Sunday a federal judge in Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-kansas-abortion-law.php">refused to block an abortion law</a> [JURIST report] challenged by Planned Parenthood that requires abortion providers' websites to contain a link to a state information page. In June the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy site] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/rights-group-challenges-north-dakota-abortion-laws.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court alleging that two restrictive North Dakota abortion laws violate the US constitution. Also in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-recess-appointments.php">agreed to review</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1168.htm">McCullen v.

The group of defendants includes unnamed doctors, academics, lawyers and other professionals arrested over the past year for allegedly forming a secret network with ties to the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>]. The court found that the defendants planned to raise money to stage a coup against the Emirati ruling families. Most of the defendants are members of the conservative <a href="http://www.al-islah.net/">Reform and Social Guidance Association</a> (al-Islah) [advocacy website, in Arabic], a nonviolent Islamist political association advocating greater adherence to Islamic precepts. According to media sources eight suspects <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/activist-united-arab-emirates-court-sentences-suspects-with-up-to-15-years-in-coup-plot/2013/07/02/75cb4a18-e2e5-11e2-8657-fdff0c195a79_story.html">received prison terms</a> [AP report] of 15 years after being tried <em>in absentia</em>. The court gave 10-year sentences to 56 of the suspects, seven-year terms to five others and acquitted 25. The trial <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uae-begins-trial-of-94-activists-charged-in-alleged-coup-plot.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in March. The UAE tolerates no political opposition within its borders. 

<p>UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. In late April rights groups called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST report] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. In July prominent human rights lawyer and al-Islah member Mohammed al-Roken, along with his son and son-in-law, were all <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uae-arrests-prominent-lawyer-in-ongoing-crackdown-on-islamist-dissidents.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] just a few days after the arrest of another prominent human rights lawyer, Mohammed Mansoori. A month later Al-Roken and Mansoori <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/imprisoned-lawyers-in-uae-go-on-hunger-strike.php">began a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest their detentions. Both lawyers are reportedly among the 94 defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi appointed Talaat Abdallah as PG in November, pursuant to a controversial constitutional declaration which dismissed and replaced the Mubarak-era PG Mahmoud and immunized Morsi's own decisions from judicial appeal. The Cairo Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-overturns-presidents-removal-of-prosecutor-general.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Mahmoud's dismissal in March based on a constitutional provision which established that the PG post comes with a four-year term and is not subject to presidential dismissal. Abdallah, however, has not left office despite requests from Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council that he <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-top-judges-urge-prosecutor-general-to-resign.php">resign</a> [JURIST report] and return to his former position as a judge. Abdallah has been criticized by the liberal opposition for targeting critics of Morsi, the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website], and independent media, including the popular television satirist Bassem Youssef who was recently arrested for allegedly insulting Islam and Morsi. Mahmoud <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/02/court-of-cassation-rules-mubarak-era-prosecutor-general-to-return-to-post/">pledged</a> [Daily News Egypt Report] to protect the rights of the people after the ruling.

<p>Egypt has been the seat of political unrest since the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. In a controversial move in March, Abdallah <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/top-egypt-prosecutor-issues-arrest-warrants-for-5-activists.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] arrest warrants for five activists for their alleged involvement in an opposition campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood and President Morsi. To quell the growing violence and unrest that resulted in the deaths of at least 50 Egyptians, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a state of emergency in January, giving military the authority to arrest and detain instigators. During the same month, rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights reported that police abuse and torture has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">not improved</a> [JURIST report] since the end of the Mubarak regime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision, written by Judge <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/meron_bio.pdf">Theodor Meron</a> [UN profile], was partially based upon evidence of Krajisnik's rehabilitation during his time in prison:
<blockquote>The SPR Report states  that Krajisnik "could be termed  as  a model prisoner"  and that since his arrival  at the Usk prison, "he has  behaved in  an  exemplary manner." It notes that Krajisnik  attends the prison's education department to improve his  knowledge of the English language, is involved in a Bible study group,  and  "uses the  gym to keep himself fit." The SPR Report further notes that, upon release, Krajisnik wishes to return to his home in Pale, in Republika Srpska, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and work at his children's petrol station company</blockquote>Despite two judges' belief that he should be released on August 3, the date that will mark completion of two-thirds of his total sentence, Meron determined that he will be released on September 1. 

<p>The ICTY had denied three of Krajisnik's previous requests for early release denied, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icty-rejects-former-serb-parliament-speakers-request-for-early-release.php">most recently</a> [JURIST report] last November.  Krajisnik had previously been denied early release in 2011 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-denies-early-release-of-former-serb-parliament-head.php">2010</a> [JURIST report]. At Krajisnik's 2006 trial, the ICTY found him not guilty on a charge of genocide, for which prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/icty-prosecutors-seek-life-sentence.php">requested a life sentence</a>, but still <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">sentenced to 27 years</a> [JURIST reports] imprisonment for various other war crimes. Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive], with whom Krajisnik worked closely, was also <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> in 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/karadzic-opens-defense-before-icty.php">currently faces war crimes charges</a> [JURIST reports] before the ICTY. Krajisnik was initially indicted along with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=plavsic">Biljana Plavsic</a> [JURIST news archive], the former Bosnian Serb president, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003 after testifying against Krajisnik. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ireland currently has abortion laws which are heavily influenced by the Catholic Church, to which two-thirds of the country's population belongs, and impose strict restraints on situations in which abortion is allowed. <a href="http://www.armagharchdiocese.org/cardinal-brady/">Cardinal Sean Brady</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.catholicbishops.ie/2013/07/01/cardinal-sean-brady-raises-legal-constitutional-concerns-protection-life-pregnancy-bill-2013/">raised concerns</a> [Catholic bishops advocacy website] about the bill since it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ireland-government-introduces-abortion-legislation.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in early May.  <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Home/">Prime Minister Enda Kenny</a> [official website] <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/irish-abortion-bill-passes-1st-test-138-24-vote">has indicated</a> [AP report] that this law would not interfere with the country's constitutional ban on abortion, but would provide guidance for doctors on which abortions should be deemed medically necessary. The bill will now be sent back to the subcommittee on health for a second reading.

<p>Ireland has some of the most conservative abortion laws in Europe, and the subject remains a highly divisive issue in the country. The legislation approved on Tuesday was proposed shortly after the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion. Following her death, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gilmore.ie/">Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ireland-deputy-pm-promises-to-clarify-abortion-laws-following-death.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring "legal clarity" to the country's abortion laws. In November, the <a href="http://www.dohc.ie/">Department of Health</a> [official website] was provided with an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/taoiseach-expert-group-delivered-abortion-report-last-night-574183.html">expert group report</a> [Irish Examiner report] on abortion laws, which was commissioned after a 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website]. The ruling stated that Ireland failed to provide "effective and adequate procedures" to allow women to exercise their right to a lawful abortion and that the country's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12008623">legal situation</a> [BBC backgrounder] constituted a "chilling factor" for both women and doctors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Habre will appear before the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/113271">Extraordinary African Chambers</a> [statute, in French], a special court set up in Senegal to investigate the allegations against him, and he could face <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ex-chad-ruler-charged-crimes-against-humanity-164829732.html">life in prison</a> [AP report] if convicted. Known as "Africa's Pinochet," the former Chadian dictator must answer claims that members of his tightly managed Secret Service tortured and killed up to 40,000 people during his reign from 1982-90. If brought to trial, Habre would be the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23153532">first African leader</a> [BBC report] to face charges of crimes against humanity in a fellow African country. 

<p>Habre had spent the last eight years on house arrest until Senegalese police <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/senegal-police-arrest-former-chad-dictator.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] him on Sunday. The <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website] began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed at that time to make any serious efforts to prosecute him. Earlier that year, lawyers for the Belgian government had <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium. In 2011, Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision to deport Habre</a> [JURIST report] back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned of possible torture. That month, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay his deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death in absentia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Protests and demonstrations erupted throughout Egypt on Sunday, in which protesters called for the resignation of Morsi for his alleged failure to address economic and security issues in the last year. OHCHR Spokesperson Rupert Colville urged all political parties and social groups to reach a solution amidst the political unrest to ensure the safety of the Egyptian people. Colville said,
<blockquote>We urge the Egyptian government to continue to make every effort to protect the rights of citizens to engage in peaceful protests and demonstrations. We regret the deaths that have occurred in Egypt since Sunday, and stress that any perpetrators of attacks against peaceful demonstrators, who are found to have used excessive force, should be held accountable.</blockquote>The Egyptian army on Monday gave Morsi and the country's government a deadline of Wednesday to appease protesters before it would intervene and implement its own road map to solving this issues. Morsi <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/07/02/egypt-protests-mursi-idINDEE96100P20130702">responded</a> [Reuters report] by stating that he would continue with his own plans, despite the army's warning.

<p>Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. In February, thirteen Egyptian <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-rights-groups-ministry-of-interior-responsible-for-abuses.php">human rights organizations alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt's Ministry of Interior is responsible for police brutality and the deaths of protestors. Earlier that month OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized </a>[JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. The draft law requires that organizers inform authorities about protest plans in advance and allows the interior ministry the right to reject demonstrations. The OHCHR also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] in January over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protest throughout the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In their motion, Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Belbacha, Nabil Hadjarab and Abu Wa'el Dhiab alleged that the practice violates human rights law and medical ethics, while serving "no penological interest." They also noted that they have all been detained at Guantanamo for 11 years and have since determined that it is not likely they will ever be charged or released, and thus their being force-fed serves no military necessity. They requested an accelerated hearing on the issue in order to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/guantanamo-bay-force-feeding-93619.html">avoid any conflict</a> [AP report] with the upcoming Islamic holiday Ramadan, which begins on the evening of July 8. US District Court Judge Gladys Kessler <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/01/justice/guantanamo-lawsuit/index.html">set a deadline</a> [CNN report] of 12:00 PM EST on Wednesday for the government to respond. Currently, there are 166 detainees at the Guantanamo prison, of which 106 are on hunger strike. 

<p>Last month, a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo Bay detainee cases. Just days prior, Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The appointment follows a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo, but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own. In contrast, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">2014 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF] in early June, which allocates more than 200 million dollars to keep the detention center open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Snowden, an American NSA employee who allegedly leaked classified information, has taken refuge in an airport in Russia, and is seeking asylum in a number of countries.

The PPACA mandate requiring companies with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health coverage to its employees and to adhere to specific information reporting practices was expected to take effect in 2014. The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/health-law-employer-mandate-said-to-be-delayed-to-2015.html">extensive reporting requirements</a> [Bloomberg report] include items such as the months during which employees and any of their dependents is covered by health insurance. Upon enforcement, employers not in compliance with PPACA coverage requirements will receive monetary penalties from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] for each employee who remains without employer provided coverage. The DOT also stated that it will publish formal guidance for businesses to help simplify the upcoming transition. Despite the employer mandate delay, the DOT stated that it strongly encourages businesses to voluntarily implement the information reporting in 2014.    

<p>The employer mandate delay is one of the latest developments concerning the PPACA. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com/">Hobby Lobby</a> [corporate website] may challenge the mandate to provide employees with coverage for contraceptives under the PPACA. The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that the company sufficiently established a likelihood of success in showing that their rights are substantially burdened by the contraceptive-coverage requirement and that they have established an irreparable harm. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled last year that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text] of the act, which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">did not violate the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The PPACA was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in March of 2010. It was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/11/house-passes-landmark-health-care.php">passed</a> by the US House of Representatives and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] by the US Senate months earlier.<br />

Protests and demonstrations erupted throughout Egypt on Sunday calling for Morsi's resignation for his alleged failure to address economic and security issues during his one year tenure as president. The military announced its plans to overthrow Morsi early in the day, and by the late afternoon soldiers and tanks surrounded the presidential palace where thousands of Morsi's supporters had gathered. Thereafter, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi officially <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137319828176718.html">declared Morsi's removal from office</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Morsi <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/75594.aspx">condemned</a> [Ahram report] the military's actions as an unjustified and illegitimate coup that he rejects. An aide in the Office of Assistant to the President of Egypt on Foreign Relations <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Foreign.Relations.President.Asst.Egy">responded</a> [Facebook page; <em>NYT</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/world/middleeast/in-open-letter-top-morsi-aide-says-coup-is-under-way.html?src=un&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fworld%2Fmiddleeast%2Findex.jsonp">report</a>] to the military's actions as they occurred: <blockquote>For the sake of Egypt and for historical accuracy, let's call what is happening by its real name: Military coup...It has been two and a half years after a popular revolution against a dictatorship that had strangled and drained Egypt for 30 years. That revolution restored a sense of hope and fired up Egyptians' dreams of a future in which they could claim for themselves the same dignity that is every human being's birthright...Today only one thing matters. In this day and age no military coup can succeed in the face of sizeable popular force without considerable bloodshed. Who among you is ready to shoulder that blame?...There are still people in Egypt who believe in their right to make a democratic choice. Hundreds of thousands of them have gathered in support of democracy and the Presidency. And they will not leave in the face of this attack. To move them, there will have to be violence. It will either come from the army, the police, or the hired mercenaries. Either way there will be considerable bloodshed. And the message will resonate throughout the Muslim World loud and clear: democracy is not for Muslims...The silence of all of those voices with an impending military coup is hypocritical and that hypocrisy will not be lost on a large swathe of Egyptians, Arabs and Muslims.</blockquote>The military announced plans to hold elections in the near future. Mansour will be sworn in on Thursday.

<p>Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. Yesterday the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-urges-egypt-president-to-appease-protestors.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Morsi to "heed the lessons of the past" and listen to the demands of the Egyptian public. In February, thirteen Egyptian human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-rights-groups-ministry-of-interior-responsible-for-abuses.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt's Ministry of Interior is responsible for police brutality and the deaths of protestors. Earlier that month OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. The draft law requires that organizers inform authorities about protest plans in advance and allows the interior ministry the right to reject demonstrations. The OHCHR also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] in January over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protest throughout the country.<br />

Chekkouri described being surrounded by eight guards and a watch commander in a room while two guards "put their hands all over" him. Todd Breasseale, speaking on behalf of the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website], has stated:

<blockquote>We will not be discussing this matter in the press because it is currently in active litigation and we will have nothing to add until it is decided in court...Generally speaking, however, I can tell you that those entrusted with safeguarding the detainees at JTF Guantanamo Bay are some of the most professional, most heavily scrutinized guards on the planet and absurd accusations simply do not withstand intellectual rigor.</blockquote>

<p>Chekkouri's lawyer, however, claims that assault is a tactic used to prevent inmates from spreading information about what is happening inside Guantanamo Bay to the outside world. He stated that if detainees must weigh whether to disclose information against prospective assault, they will choose to withhold information to avoid the assault.</p>

<p>Last month, a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo Bay detainee cases. Just days prior, Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The appointment follows a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo, but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own. In contrast, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">2014 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF] in early June, which allocates more than 200 million dollars to keep the detention center open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill will likely shut down most of the state's abortion clinics because it requires clinics to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/04/abortion-regulations-north-carolina/2488569/">meet the same standards as ambulatory surgery centers</a> [AP report]. The bill also bans gender-selective abortions, restricts insurance coverage of abortions under the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and requires a doctor to be present both when an abortion procedure is performed and when a woman takes an abortion-inducing drug. The bill drew a firestorm of criticism from pro-choice activists, who denounced the bill as an unjust intrusion on women's reproductive rights. Opponents of the bill also criticized the fact that the bill was tacked onto unrelated legislation and not given a public hearing. <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Patrick McCrory</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130703/statement-governor">criticized</a> [press release] the process through which the bill was passed, stating: "Regardless of what party is in charge or what important issue is being discussed, the process must be appropriate and thorough." It is unclear if McCrory will sign the bill into law.

<p>Many states have increased restrictions on abortions recently, keeping the issue a controversial one. On Sunday Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed new abortion restrictions into law</a> [JURIST report] that require ultrasounds for anyone seeking to obtain an abortion and curtail the ability of family planning services to receive funding. The bill was signed just a few days after Texas state Senator Wendy Davis was able to successfully filibuster against proposed anti-abortion laws in her home state <a href="http://rt.com/usa/wendy-davis-texas-abortion-496/">in front of a crowd of supporters</a> [RT report] from across the country. Last week a federal judge in Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-kansas-abortion-law.php">refused to block an abortion law</a> [JURIST report] challenged by Planned Parenthood that requires abortion providers' websites to contain a link to a state information page. In June the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy site] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/rights-group-challenges-north-dakota-abortion-laws.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court alleging that two restrictive North Dakota abortion laws violate the US constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.pmln.org/">Pakistan Muslim League-N</a> (PML-N), a center-right party, took power during elections in May, defeating the incumbent <a href="http://www.pppurdu.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a> (PPP) [official websites]. PML-N Interior Ministry spokesman Umer Hameed <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/04/pakistan-ends-moratorium-on-executions/">declared</a> [AFP report] that the government will begin to impose the death penalty on a case-by-case basis. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/pakistan-thousands-of-prisoners-at-risk-if-government-resumes-executions">sharply criticized</a> [press release] Pakistan's reinstatement of the death penalty as an unjust and ineffective response to crime and violence:<blockquote>"At a time when Pakistan&#8217;s justice system is struggling to cope with the law and order situation, it can be all too easy for governments to see the death penalty as a quick fix solution. But the death penalty is not the answer to Pakistan&#8217;s justice problems. Resuming executions would do nothing to tackle crime or militancy, but instead just perpetuate a cycle of violence."</blockquote>  Hameed said there are more than 450 convicts who could possibly be executed when the moratorium is lifted.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] has been the subject of great political, legal and moral controversy recently. Last week the US Supreme Court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-issues-final-orders-of-term.php">consider jury instructions in a death penalty case</a> [JURIST report] in its next term. Also last week, the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=692&Itemid=177">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] ordered Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin and Ashrafuzzaman Khan to be <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-court-indicts-2-in-absentia.php">tried in absentia</a> [JURIST report] for the murders of 19 intellectuals and 11 crimes against humanity committed during the 1971 independence war and both men could face the death penalty. Two weeks ago, the Oregon Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/oregon-supreme-court-upholds-governors-death-penalty-moratorium.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a death row inmate cannot reject a reprieve by the governor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This crackdown occurred only a day after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">removed Morsi from office</a> [JURIST report] and installed an interim government headed by High Constitutional Court judge <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile]. The military also <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/07/04/egypt-protests-tv-idINDEE96300K20130704">raided the offices</a> [Reuters report] of Al Jazeera's Egyptian news channel and detained at least five of its staff members, four of whom were later released. Another station run by the Muslim Brotherhood <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/rights-groups-decry-egypt-crackdown-on-media-considered-pro-morsi/2013/07/04/d15414f0-e4d4-11e2-bffd-37a36ddab820_story.html">was removed from the air</a> [AP report] as it was showing pro-Morsi protesters chanting "down with military rule" following the announcement that Morsi had been removed from power. The crackdown has caused concern among various groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], whose General Secretary Salil Shetty <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egypt-unrest-update-2013-07-03">stated</a> [AI news report]:<blockquote>There has already been a blow to freedom of expression, with several TV channels which supported the President silenced and staff reportedly arrested immediately after his overthrow. Amid fears of possible reprisals and revenge attacks against supporters of President Morsi, along with the worrying trend of mob violence and sexual assaults on women this is a time for extreme caution.</blockquote>Various other human rights organizations also expressed concern about the extensive record of human rights violations that Egypt&#8217;s armed forces have committed in the past, and urged them to comply with international human rights laws in this time of great tension.  

<p>Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. On Tuesday, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Morsi to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-urges-egypt-president-to-appease-protestors.php">listen to the demands of the Egyptian public</a> [JURIST report]. In February, thirteen Egyptian human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-rights-groups-ministry-of-interior-responsible-for-abuses.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt's Ministry of Interior was responsible for police brutality and deaths of protestors. Earlier that month, OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. The draft law requires that organizers inform authorities about protest plans in advance and allows the interior ministry the right to reject demonstrations. The OHCHR also <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] in January over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protests occurring throughout the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law goes into effect Saturday. Within hours of the signing, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/Wisconsin/">Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a federal <a href="https://aclu-wi.org/sites/default/files/media/pdf/Complaint%20-%20Abortion%20Bill%20Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] alleging that the bill is unconstitutional and asking for a temporary restraining order blocking the measure. Supporters of the bill contend that ultrasounds will help a woman make an informed choice. Opponents argue that the legislature should not force women to undergo any medical procedure. Moreover, two abortion clinics would have to close, as providers lack admitting privileges to a hospital within a 30 miles. Walker did not sign the bill in public, but issued a <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Default.aspx?Page=62ffa02c-f2f6-41fc-9f80-95ced7e52a75">statement</a> [text] Friday afternoon stating the bill was now law. "This bill improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future," the statement said. 

<p>A number of states have recently passed laws relating to <a href="/feature/2013/07/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last week Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed abortion restrictions into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring women to first undergo ultrasounds. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] signed a measure <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation</a> [JURIST report] based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." That law has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">blocked by a federal judge</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Crown prosecutor has 30 days to appeal the ruling. 

<p>Other countries have also decided to prosecute individuals suspected suspect of involvement in Rwanda's 1994 genocides.

Qatada was previously sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison for conspiring to carry out <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-qaeda ">news archive</a>] linked attacks in Jordan, but he will now face a retrial. Jordan's Military State Security Court prosecutor has ordered that Qatada be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/07/us-britan-jordan-qatada-idUSBRE96604B20130707">detained for 15 days</a> [Reuters report] pending further questioning. Qatada's lawyer has stated that Qatada denies the charges and plans to post bail. 

<p>Qatada, previously described as "Osama Bin Laden's right hand man in Europe," has been held in the UK for more than a decade since he was arrested in 2002 under the anti-terrorism act. Last month, Jordan's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/jordan-approves-uk-treaty-that-will-lead-to-deportation-of-abu-qatada.php">approved a treaty</a> [JURIST report] with the UK that led to his deportation. In April the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uk-appeals-court-denies-governments-abu-qatada-appeal.php">UK Court of Appeals refused</a> to allow the government to appeal to the Supreme Court an earlier decision <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-appeal-to-deport-radical-islamist-cleric-dismissed.php">not to deport</a> [JURIST reports] Qatada until a fair trial treaty had been ratified, fearing Qatada would be tortured upon his return to Jordan. The UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied</a> bail last year after Qatada was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST reports] and rearrested to begin deportation proceedings. In February of 2009, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">ordered the UK</a> [JURIST report] to pay &#163;2,500 in damages to Qataba after determining that he was imprisoned by the UK in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Muizineks acknowledged that <a href="http://www.tccb.gov.tr/speeches-statements/344/86279/preb-statement.html">recent statements by President Abdullah Gul</a> [press release] referencing the responsibility of police in the escalation of anti-government protests will help to begin pacifying tension. Muizineks, however, said the only way Turkey can fully recover "is to conduct independent, impartial, and effective investigations, with the involvement of victims, into all allegations of misconduct by security forces." Lastly, Muiznieks urged authorities to guard against a campaign of intimidation against various professionals like doctors, lawyers and academics who participated in anti-government protests.

<p>Various other human rights groups have called for recovery measures to be taken in Turkey following the recent anti-government protests. Last month the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Turkish government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-office-urges-turkey-to-ensure-right-to-assembly.php">ensure the rights of its citizens</a> [JURIST report] to assemble freely and in a peaceful manner. Also in June the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights commended the Turkish government's decision to delay government construction that was being protested by Turkish citizens and urged authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-urges-turkish-government-protesters-to-defuse-tensions.php">work to defuse tensions</a> [JURIST report]. Also last month the Human Rights Watch called on Turkish police to use <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-turkey-should-end-police-violence-against-protestors.php">non-violent tactics</a> [JURIST report] against citizen protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution requested Douma's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/06/us-egypt-blogger-idUSBRE96506A20130706">release</a> [Reuters report] on Thursday, dropping his charges of publicly insulting Morsi in June. Despite the release order, Douma remained in custody for another trial on a separate charge. Douma was charged along with 11 others with inciting violence during protests in March in which at least 160 people were injured. The Cairo Criminal Court on Sunday <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/07/court-exonerates-activists/">acquitted all 12 defendants</a> [<em>Daily News Egypt</em> report] because the evidence against them was deemed void. 

<p>Morsi was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed from office</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday by the Egyptian military after several protests and demonstrations calling for his resignation for his alleged failure to address economic and security issues during his one-year tenure as president. Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. Earlier this week, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-urges-egypt-president-to-appease-protestors.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Morsi to "heed the lessons of the past" and listen to the demands of the Egyptian public. In February 13 Egyptian human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-rights-groups-ministry-of-interior-responsible-for-abuses.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt's Ministry of Interior was responsible for police brutality and the deaths of protesters. Earlier that month the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. The draft law required that organizers inform authorities about protest plans in advance and allows the interior ministry the right to reject demonstrations. The OHCHR also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] in January over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protest throughout the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new bill, approved by a vote of 14-0 with four abstentions, would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/07/us-israel-conscription-idUSBRE96608C20130707">limit the number of men</a> [Reuters report] who are exempted from being drafted every year. Since its foundation, Israel exempted ultra-Orthodox men studying in seminaries, religious women and Arab citizens of Israel from military service. However, the new bill reduces the number of people who can be exempted to 1,800 outstanding seminary students per year. <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/state/pages/benjamin%20netanyahu.aspx">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2013/Pages/Cabinet-communique-7-July-2013.aspx">statement</a> [press release] explaining the rationale behind the new bill:<blockquote>Today, after 65 years, we are submitting for Cabinet approval the outline on increasing equality in sharing the burden. We will enact this change gradually while considering the special needs of the ultra-orthodox population. Our objective is two-fold: Integrating young ultra-orthodox into IDF and national service and, no less important, integrating them into the labor force.</blockquote>The new bill allows a four-year interim period for young ultra-Orthodox to enlist. The recent approval was criticized by religious leaders who accused the government of unfairly persecuting them. The new bill will be presented to parliament for approval.

<p>Israel's military service law demands all Israeli citizens be drafted at age 18. The country's new government that took office in March is the first one in almost 20 years without any ultra-Orthodox parties. Earlier this week, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein ruled that the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/National-News/A-G-Proposed-haredi-IDF-service-law-is-legal-318421">new bill was legal</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report], reasoning that its underlying purpose was to create greater equality in military service. Although Weinstein found some problematic issues with the new bill, the proposed law will not be fully implemented until 2017, so he decided to await further information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The oil-for-food program allowed the Iraqi government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saddam+hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], which was under UN sanctions in the wake of the first Gulf War, to sell limited stocks of oil in return for foodstuffs and other humanitarian supplies. Total was accused of bribing Iraqi officials to secure oil illegally. Among the defendants acquitted were also Swiss oil trader Vitol and former French interior minister Charles Pasqua. Prosecutors have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/08/france-total-idUSL6N0FE2F920130708">10 days to appeal the verdict</a> [Reuters report].

<p>The oil-for-food program, established in 1996, was mired with controversy. In February a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-dismisses-iraq-oil-for-food-corruption-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] an Iraqi government lawsuit accusing numerous business entities of conspiring with Hussein to disrupt the program, thereby denying Iraqi citizens access to approximately $10 billion of essential aid. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric</a> (GE) [corporate website] agreed to a $23.5 million settlement after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint accusing GE of <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ge-agrees-to-settle-sec-complaint-in-oil-for-food-scandal.php">bribing Iraqi officials</a> [JURIST report] to receive contracts under the oil-for-food program. Additionally, oil company <a href="http://www.chevron.com/">Chevron</a> [corporate website] also <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chevron-settles-sec-charges-in-oil-for.php">paid a large settlement</a> to the SEC concerning misuse of the program, and two Texan oil barons, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/texas-oil-company-owner-sentenced-to.php">David Chalmers</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/texas-oil-tycoon-sentenced-to-year-in.php">Oscar Wyatt Jr.</a> [JURIST reports], were sentenced to prison for their roles in the scandal. In 2005 Grundfos, a Danish company that produces industrial pumps, <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/danish-supplier-admits-role-in-un-oil.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that two employees paid kickbacks to authorities in Hussein's government under the oil-for-food program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

EPIC is <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EPICMandamusPressRelease7-8-13.pdf">arguing</a> [press release, PDF] that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) exceeded its authority when it "ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation." The <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">secret court order was revealed</a> last month by Edward Snowden, who has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged with espionage</a> [JURIST reports] and has reportedly been offered asylum by Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

<p>Several other challenges to the surveillance program have been filed. Last month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/nsa_phone_spying_complaint.pdf">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the NSA's phone data collection program. As a Verizon business network services customer, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-constitutionality-nsa-phone-spying-program">argued</a> [press release] that the program violates the rights of free speech and association as well as the right of privacy as protected by the First and Fourth Amendments.

In February, the Eleventh Circuit and the <a href="http://www.gaappeals.us/">Court of Appeals of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-and-state-courts-each-order-stay-of-execution-of-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">issued a stay on Hill's execution</a> [JURIST report] just minutes before he was scheduled to be executed so the court could consider whether evidence of his mental retardation was new and could be a basis for an appeal. However, the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">lifted the stay</a> [JURIST report] in April, finding that Hill's claim of mental retardation was already presented, and that his claim does not address his actual guilt or innocence, meaning that it cannot be further reviewed. Hill is <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/georgia-sets-new-execution-date-for-convicted-kill/nYdFc/">now scheduled to be executed</a> [AJC report] on Monday, July 15 at 7PM EST at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, Georgia.

<p>Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 murder of a fellow inmate while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend in 1986. His execution has been stayed several times. The Eleventh Circuit granted the latest stay in February, hours after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-campaign-finance-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hill's petition for <em>certiorari</em>. Hill's appeal to the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/georgia-supreme-court-rejects-death-row-inmates-appeal.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. Last July the Supreme Court of Georgia unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-supreme-court-halts-warren-hill-execution.php">granted a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] 90 minutes before Hill was scheduled to be executed, in order to consider the state's new single-dose lethal injection protocol. In a separate order the court also denied Hill's request to hear his appeal of a Butts County Superior Court ruling, which held that Hill had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-court-declines-to-halt-execution-of-mentally-disabled-death-row-inmate.php">failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</a> [JURIST report] that he is mentally disabled, and that the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard itself is constitutional. The US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [opinion] that the execution of mentally retarded individuals is cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last November, Bruins was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-nazi-for-1944-killing.php">charged for the murder</a> [JURIST report] of resistance fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in 1944. Bruins and his suspected accomplice August Neuhaeuser, who has since died, are <a href="http://www.shortnews.de/id/1037581/ex-ss-mitglied-siert-bruins-92-noch-in-diesem-jahr-vor-gericht?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=brennpunkte&utm_campaign=130708">alleged</a> [<em>ShortNews</em> report, in German] to have driven Dijkema to a secluded place and shot him at least four times while he attempted to flee. Bruins, who was born Dutch but is now a German citizen, was sentenced to prison in the 1980s for the murder of two Dutch Jews during the Second World War.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to arrest individuals charged with war crimes during the Holocaust. Last month Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hungary-prosecutors-charge-accused-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Laszlo Csatary, a 98-year-old Hungarian man, with the unlawful execution and torture of people in connection with the Holocaust. In May German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp. German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the Holocaust.

Necas resigned last month following the arrest of his closest aide <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22955937">Jana Nagyova</a> [BBC profile], who was charged with bribery and abuse of office when she allegedly offered parliamentary deputies positions in state companies in return for abandoning a rebellion against the prime minister last year. Speaker <a href="http://www.miroslavanemcova.cz/">Miroslava Nemcova</a> [official website, in Czech] stated on Czech public television that the house will vote on the request to remove immunity no earlier than September. Neither parliament nor the prosecutors have released any information on the nature of the potential charges against Necas, who denies any wrongdoing. If charged, Necas will be the first head of government to face criminal charges in the Czech Republic's modern history.

<p>Czech president Milos Zeman named Jiri Rusnok as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23053058">new prime minister</a> [BBC report] on June 25.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] 
Defense lawyers for detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/36-ibrahim-othman-ibrahim-idris">Ibrahim Idris</a> [NYT profile] have argued that he is too mentally and physically ill to remain at <a href="/feature/2013/07/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]  in a <em>habeas corpus</em> <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2013/06/28/21/59/mbLAl.So.56.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] filed at the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Rather than contend his innocence, Idris' court-appointed defense lawyer Jennifer Cowan is arguing that his mental and physical illnesses are too debilitating for him to remain a threat, so, according to both domestic and international law, he should be repatriated to his native Sudan. One of the first 20 prisoners to arrive at Camp X-Ray, Idris has been held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba since January 2002. Within weeks of his arrival, Idris was diagnosed with Disorganized Type Schizophrenia and has spent most of his nearly 12 years of detention at the prison's mental health facility. A psychological evaluation filed with the petition chronicles Idris' deteriorating mental health, stating that he often donned and removed multiple layers of clothing, spoke with an "invisible tormentor," and suffers visual hallucinations. Furthermore, the evaluation suggests that Idris was moved to the hospital in part because "[h]is fellow detainees have grown weary of tolerating his psychotic behavior." Because a prisoner of war may only be held until "[h]e is disarmed and from then on must be removed as completely as practicable from the front," Cowen argues that his social isolation, coupled with the lack of available healthcare in Sudan, would make it nearly impossible for Idris to engage in hostilities if he were repatriated, relieving any threat to the US. Lawyers for the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] have not commented on the case but will have to respond to the petition by July 15. 

<p>The petition was filed on the same day US military released a <a href="https://www.box.com/s/enhc8gdv9z1tw80xvwho">report</a> [text, PDF] criticizing Guantanamo's medical staff for not following regulations, which <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/06/2013628205450434295.html">led to the suicide of Adnan Latif</a> [Al Jazeera report], a prisoner diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Earlier this month an inmate <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-bay-inmate-accuses-us-military-of-sexual-assault-against-detainees.php">accused the military</a> [JURIST report] of sexually assaulting him and other hunger-strikers as a form of punishment. Last month a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo Bay detainee cases. Just days prior Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The appointment follows a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts.

US District Judge Carl Barbier approved a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] last year that allows plaintiffs to claim damages to their business by <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2013/07/bp_plaintiffs_lawyers_argue_be.html">comparing income</a> [<em>Times-Picayune</em> report] and revenue before and after the spill. The calculations used to determine such data sets are not expressly determined in the ruling. BP claims that many plaintiffs are receiving awards based solely on their best-performing periods, instead of a comprehensive evaluation of their business value for a set period of time. Plaintiffs' attorneys counterclaimed that BP merely underestimated the price of the settlement agreed to, and is now concerned that it will be forced to pay much more than it originally calculated. There is no cap on the amount of damages that can be awarded to this class of commercial plaintiffs. This proceeding does not affect the trust fund for those whose homes or residential property were damaged by the spill. 

<p>The BP appeal comes as the court prepares to resume the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bp-gulf-oil-spill-trial-opens.php">non-jury trial to determine liability</a> [JURIST report] for the April 2010 rupture of the Macondo well and explosion of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP">Deepwater Horizon</a> [JURIST news archive] drilling rig. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">plea agreemen</a>t [JURIST report] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] for the company's criminal liability in the spill. Earlier in January <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Ltd.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act </a>(CWA) [EPA summary] and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] BP to share partial liability with Transocean in oil spill claims in January 2012. In November of last year BP executives pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Whitewoodcomplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleges that <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/23/00.017.004.000..HTM">Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Act</a> [23 PaCS &#167; 1704] and refusal to marry same-sex couples or to recognize their out-of-state marriages violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] as well as the fundamental right to marriage. Among the plaintiffs are 10 same-sex couples, two minor children of those couples and one widow who recently lost her partner of 29 years. Plaintiffs are asking the court to closely scrutinize this treatment, claiming it burdens the fundamental right to marry and discriminates based on sex and sexual orientation. Reggie Shuford, executive director of the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">ACLU of Pennsylvania</a> [advocacy website] commented on the case, saying, "It's wrong that the state where these couples live, work, and raise families treats them as second-class couples."

<p>This lawsuit comes in the wake of the recent US Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">U.S. v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Pennsylvania joins the list of other states that have recently taken measures regarding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In March the ACLU of New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-new-mexico-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in a New Mexico state court on behalf of two same-sex couples seeking the legal right to marry. In the same month Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted in favor of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize civil unions in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Section 1 of <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/37.pdf">2013 Wisconsin Act 37</a> [text, PDF] requires that physicians who provide abortion services have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic. The <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/proposals/sb206">bill</a> [text] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wisconsin-governor-signs-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] on Friday by <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] and was challenged within hours by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/Wisconsin/">Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://aclu-wi.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites], which filed a federal <a href="https://aclu-wi.org/sites/default/files/media/pdf/Complaint%20-%20Abortion%20Bill%20Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] alleging that the bill was unconstitutional and requesting a temporary restraining order to block the measure. Larry Dupuis, legal director of the ACLU of Wisconsin <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-wisconsin-abortion-law">commented</a> [press release], "We're thankful that the judge has put the brakes on a dangerous law that was rammed through the legislature with no thought to the health and well-being of Wisconsin women and families." A full preliminary injunction hearing regarding the law is set to be held on July 17.

<p>The Wisconsin temporary restraining order is only one of the many recent developments in the ongoing controversy surrounding <a href="/feature/2013/07/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. Earlier this month Ohio Governor John Kasich also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed abortion restrictions into law</a> [JURIST report], requiring women to undergo ultrasounds prior to receiving an abortion. Last month the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in favor of a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In April North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">signed a measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month, lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2008 the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/jewel/jewel.complaint.pdf">filed a putative class action</a> [complaint, PDF] on behalf of phone and Internet users alleging the NSA used a program of "dragnet surveillance" to "indiscriminately intercept" the communications records of millions of US citizens without a warrant. The Obama administration argued the case must be dismissed on grounds that EFF's claims risked disclosure of information protected by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/learn-more/faqs/faqs:-what-are-state-secrets">"state secrets" privilege</a> [CCR backgrounder]. Judge Jeffrey White disagreed, finding that the government's public statements with respect to the surveillance program belied its argument that certain materials must be protected. However, the judge ordered the NSA to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57592742-38/judge-lawsuit-alleging-illegal-nsa-spying-may-continue/">provide further clarification</a> [CNET report] with respect to why the "recent disclosure of the government's continuing surveillance activities" could impact national security in the future. 

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA's surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In July the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian </em><a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6959">condemned</a> [official statement] recent reports of violence and murder at a mass protest site in Cairo and urged both sides to "do everything possible to avoid further escalation." According to the OHCHR more than 80 people have been killed and over 1000 injured since political turmoil gripped the nation last week. The OHCHR <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45368&Cr=egypt&Cr1=#.Udxk4hZA_zI">urged</a> [UN News Centre report] interim authorities to investigate alleged human rights violations promptly, thoroughly and transparently via an independent and impartial adjudicative body.

<p>The Egyptian military deposed Morsi last Wednesday amid protests and demonstrations calling for his resignation for his alleged failure to address economic and security issues during his one-year tenure as president. Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. Earlier this week Egyptian blogger Ahmed Douma, who had been sentenced to six months in prison for insulting Morsi, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-blogger-jailed-for-insulting-morsi-released-from-prison.php">released</a> [JURIST report] according to the state news agency MENA. Earlier in July Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down</a> [JURIST report] four Islamist-run television stations it viewed as sympathetic to Morsi. In the same timeframe the Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Adly Mansour, on <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state after the Egyptian military deposed Morsi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text] gives the FISC authority to order tech companies to disclose user data but prohibits publication with respect to whether the FISC has issued such an order. Recently, however, the government permitted certain tech companies to publish FISA requests, provided that they lumped the information together with general government requests unrelated to national security. Google and Microsoft <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2421078,00.asp">joined together</a> [PC Magazine report] in June to appeal a government decision denying their ability to publish information specifically regarding FISA national security orders. The companies reportedly sought to clear their names in the wake of allegedly erroneous media reports implicating them in recent controversies over the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) surveillance programs. Advocacy groups including the <a href="http://firstamendmentcoalition.org">First Amendment Coalition</a> (FAC), the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy websites] argue the FISC should not deny Google and Microsoft's requests in light of the First Amendment:<blockquote>Any rule precluding disclosure as to what a party itself is asked to do bears an extremely high burden of justification under broad principles protecting free expression even where the non-disclosure might be sought in service of national security. ... In making this argument, we are not insensitive to concerns for national security. But even those important concerns do not easily, let alone routinely, trump the First Amendment. ... The "free institution" at risk here is nothing less than the guarantee of free expression contained in the First Amendment. The expression at issue on the present motions&#8212;speech by Google and Microsoft about their own conduct in responding to any government requests&#8212;is central to a significant political debate at the heart of self-government. It implicates the most fundamental First Amendment values and should yield only to a government interest of the highest order subjected to the most searching judicial inquiry. The government's burden is a heavy one, as both broad principles of First Amendment law and narrower decisions issued in strikingly similar national security contexts make clear.</blockquote>The advocacy groups <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/civil-liberties-groups-ask-secret-court-let-google-microsoft-release-nsa-spying">released a joint statement</a> [press release] acknowledging the need for government secrecy but urging the FISC to protect the First Amendment.

<p>Revelations surrounding US government surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. On Monday a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging that the National Security Agency (NSA) illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" in the wake of 9/11. In July the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order.

Judge Gladys Kessler said the court lacked jurisdiction, but "It would seem to follow, therefore, that the President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief, has the authority&#8212;and power&#8212;to directly address the issue of force-feeding of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay." The Court also stated that based on the petitioner's motion there "appears to be a consensus that the force-feeding of prisoners violates Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which prohibits torture or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment." Abu Wa'el Dhiab, the named petitioner, Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Belbacha and Nabil Hadjarab <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-prisoners-ask-federal-court-to-order-end-to-force-feedings.php">filed motions</a> [JURIST report] last week alleging that the practice violates human rights law and medical ethics, while serving "no penological interest." They requested an accelerated hearing on the issue to avoid any conflict with the Islamic holiday Ramadan, which began the evening of July 8. They also noted that they have all been detained at Guantanamo for 11 years and have since determined that it is not likely they will ever be charged or released, and thus their being force-fed serves no military necessity. 

<p>Currently, there are 166 detainees at the Guantanamo prison, of which 106 are on hunger strike and 46 are classified as <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-government-releases-names-of-indefinite-guantanamo-detainees.php">indefinite detainees</a>[JURIST report]. Last month a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo Bay detainee cases. Just days prior Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo, but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own. In contrast, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov">House Armed Services Committee </a>[official website]<a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php"> approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">2014 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF] in early June, which allocates more than 200 million dollars to keep the detention center open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision to end the case leaves the path open for both companies to use the name freely, and was reached after Apple promised not to sue Amazon for using the name. Apple <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/apple.pdf">filed the lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2011 when Amazon began using the name "App Store," which Apple had been using since 2008. At this time, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-apple-amazon-appstore-lawsuit-idUSBRE9680TT20130709">spokesperson from Apple said</a> [Reuters report] that the company saw no need to continue with the case, given their customers' widespread understanding of where to find apps. The case had been scheduled to go to trial on August 19 before District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California.

<p>A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-rejects-part-of-apples-lawsuit-against-amazon.php">dismissed a false advertising claim</a> [JURIST report] that was a part of Apple's lawsuit against Amazon in January, saying that Apple had failed to prove that Amazon had willingly misled customers by using the term "App Store."

According to the UNJHRO, the DRC has convicted at least five soldiers of the Congolese armed forces, five agents of the Congolese National Police, one agent of the national intelligence service and one administrative official for practicing or encouraging torture. The sentences ranged from six months to life imprisonment. The DRC enacted a law criminalizing torture, for the first time in the history of the country, on July 9, 2011. The UNJHRO called on the government to investigate every allegation of torture. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/JuanMendez.aspx">Juan Mendez</a> [official profile] said, "I am pleased with the considerable progress which has been accomplished by the government in order to ensure conformity with national law and international standards and to put an end to the cycle of impunity which prevails for acts of torture."

<p>Torture and ill-treatment of individuals remain problems through the international community.

Badie is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23256937">accused of inciting violence</a> [BBC report] in Cairo on Monday in which more than 50 people were killed. Reports of the violence conflict, as the Brotherhood reports that soldiers carried out a massacre of peaceful demonstrators, while police and military forces say they acted in self-defense. The issued warrants further highlight the military's <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/07/10/egypt-orders-arrest-of-muslim-brotherhood-leader/">zero-tolerance policy</a> [AP report] toward the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists, who continue to hold daily mass protests demanding the reinstatement of ousted president Morsi. Many Egyptians had hoped that Wednesday's start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan would help to calm the ongoing turmoil, but the sunrise-to-sunset fasting may only diminish protest activity during daytime hours.  

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked last week after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [official BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>], in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile], subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state. Only one day after Morsi was ousted, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities</a> [JURIST report] to address the escalating violence.

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] accused Apple of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books. Five publishers, Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon &#38; Schuster Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and Macmillan, were originally named in the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f282100/282135.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] but since reached a settlement with the government. Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-judge-apple-conspired-raise-e-book-prices">called the ruling</a> [AP report] a victory for consumers. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr, however, continues to deny the accusations and stated that the company will appeal the decision. Among other requests for damages, the DOJ is requesting that Apple establish an antitrust compliance program as well as antitrust training for executives. The ruling stated that a scheduling order will now follow in order to determine damages. 

<p>In May Judge Denise Cote gave a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-believes-doj-will-prevail-in-apple-antitrust-case.php">tentative opinion</a> [JURST report] that the government would be successful in its antitrust claim. The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April 2012, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May of last year. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">merely "superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books at a loss in order to drive the sale of Kindles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill prohibits carrying a firearm in schools, courthouses and government buildings and has restrictions based on mental health. Prospective carriers must be 21 or older, pay a fee, possess a valid weapon ownership identification card and have a clean criminal record. Last week, Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] reportedly leveraged his veto power in an attempt to insert more restrictive proscriptions into the bill, including limiting lawful possession to one firearm per person. Illinois lawmakers, however, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/illinois-concealed-carry-_12_n_3568718.html">voted to override</a> [AP report] Quinn's proposed amendments by large margins in both the House and the Senate. The bill's passage follows a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-us-court-of-1.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] Illinois' previous concealed carry prohibition as violative of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text]. Illinois now joins the other 49 states in approving some type of concealed weapon.

<p>Passage of the Illinois bill is the latest development in the ongoing Second Amendment and gun control debate. In April the US Supreme Court declined to hear a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-new-york-concealed-carry-law.php">challenge to a New York state gun law</a> [JURIST report] requiring those who desire to carry a concealed handgun to show they have a special reason before they can obtain a license. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/utah-governor-vetoes-concealed-weapons-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed people to carry an unloaded, concealed gun without a permit. Also in March the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-maryland-concealed-carry-permit-restrictions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Maryland can require concealed-carry handgun permit applicants to provide a "good and substantial reason" for wanting to carry a gun outside the home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As federal law currently stands, employers are only prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, sex, national origin, disability and age. In addition, only a minority of states <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/employment-non-discrimination-act_n_3572902.html">extend employment protections</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] to the LGBT community, meaning that workers can be discriminated against in the area of employment solely for being LGBT. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">Obama administration</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/10/statement-press-secretary-senate-committee-vote-employment-non-discrimin">praised</a> [press release] HELP's approval of the bill:<blockquote>The President has long supported an inclusive ENDA, which would enshrine into law strong, lasting and comprehensive protections against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. We look forward to the full Senate's consideration of ENDA, and continue to urge the House to move forward on this bill that upholds America's core values of fairness and equality.</blockquote>The bill will now go before the full Senate for a vote before proceeding to the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> [official website].

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue worldwide. In January the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-protect-state-lgbt-employees-from-discrimination.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit the state government from discriminating against its employees based on sexual orientation. HELP <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/senate-committee-holds-hearing-on-sexual-orientation-discrimination-bill.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] in June 2012 regarding ENDA, focusing on discrimination faced by LGBT employees across the country. Earlier in June 2012 JURIST guest columnist Brynne Madway <a href="/dateline/2012/06/brynne-madway-same-sex.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the LGBT community must shift some of its focus to promoting anti-discrimination laws, noting that only a small number of states have nondiscrimination laws that include gender identity and sexual orientation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The SCDC abolished the policy in an effort to revamp medical services and in consideration of a federal court order to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-orders-alabama-to-desegregate-hiv-positive-prisoners.php">end a similar policy in Alabama</a> [JURIST report]. The SCDC has not determined a date for integration. There are currently 351 male and 15 female prisoners in South Carolina infected with HIV. According to the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/south-carolina-becomes-final-state-end-segregation-prisoners-hiv">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [press release]:<blockquote>For decades, HIV-positive prisoners in South Carolina have been subjected to a policy which required isolation and segregation, and forced prisoners to involuntarily disclose their health status in violation of medical ethics and international human rights law. Prisoners living with HIV were barred from equal access to many in-prison jobs and programs, including a host of rehabilitative, educational, trade skills and vocational programs.</blockquote>The ACLU welcomed the move as "a milestone in the ACLU's campaign to end HIV segregation in the Deep South."

<p>In December a judge for the US DIstrict Court for the Middle District of Alabama ruled that Alabama's policy of segregating HIV-positive prisoners violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ACLU filed the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Class_Action_Complaint_Final.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the <a href="http://www.doc.state.al.us">Alabama Department of Corrections</a> (ADOC) [official website] in 2011. The ACLU and <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] jointly produced a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Report%20Sentenced%20to%20Stigma%20Segregation%20of%20HIV-Positive%20Prisoners%20in%20Alabama%20and%20South%20Carolina.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], which concluded that the prisoners face fundamental discrimination which amounts to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners," including "involuntary disclosure of HIV status to family, staff and other prisoners; loss of liberty by assignment to higher security prisons; denial of work, program and re-entry opportunities; and policies that promote, rather than combat, fear, prejudice and even violence against persons living with HIV." In 2009 Mississippi ended its HIV segregation policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Crimes under article 226 are considered "offenses against privacy," and "violations of personal rights resulting from computer files or processes." In a press release FIDH <a href="http://www.fidh.org/fidh-and-ldh-file-a-complaint-for-infringement-of-personal-data-13648">condemned</a> [press release] PRISM, stating, "this blatant intrusion into individuals' lives represents a serious threat to individual liberties and, if not stopped, may lead to the end of the rule of law." The complaint does not name the NSA or any other target, instead asking for the opening of an official inquiry into the alleged privacy violations.

<p>Several other challenges to the NSA's surveillance programs have been filed recently. Earlier this week the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] challenging the NSA telephone record surveillance program. EPIC is <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EPICMandamusPressRelease7-8-13.pdf">arguing</a> [press release, PDF] that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) exceeded its authority when it "ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation." Last month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the NSA's phone data collection program. As a Verizon business network services customer, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-constitutionality-nsa-phone-spying-program">argued</a> [press release] that the program violates the rights of free speech and association as well as the right of privacy as protected by the First and Fourth Amendments. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The rights group is representing 23 plaintiffs: 10 LGBT couples, two children of one of the couples, and the surviving partner in a same-sex couple. Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/ogc_-_attorneys/3258/the_general_counsel/425252">General Counsel James Schultz</a> [official profile] will most likely defend the Commonwealth, <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_pa_gov/20650">Govenor Tom Corbett</a> [official website] and other Commonwealth officials named in the suit.

The <a href="http://www.dohc.ie/publications/pdf/Protection_of_life_during_Pregnancy_Bill_2013.pdf?direct=1">Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill</a> [text, PDF] was passed after <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/11/world/europe/ireland-abortion/">contentious debate</a> [CNN report], particularly concerning a provision that allows a woman to undergo an abortion if she is at risk of committing suicide. Opponents argue that this provision will allow any woman to threaten suicide just to undergo the procedure. A provision allowing abortions if the woman is the victim of incest or rape was not included in the final version. The legislation also includes criminal penalties for women who undergo unlawful abortions or for doctors and hospitals that perform them.

<p>The legislation was proposed shortly after the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion.

In November, the <a href="http://www.dohc.ie/">Department of Health</a> [official website] was provided with an <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/taoiseach-expert-group-delivered-abortion-report-last-night-574183.html">expert group report</a> [<em>Irish Examiner</em> report] on abortion laws, which was commissioned after a 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website]. The ruling stated that Ireland failed to provide "effective and adequate procedures" to allow women to exercise their right to a lawful abortion and that the country's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12008623">legal situation</a> [BBC backgrounder] constituted a "chilling factor" for both women and doctors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances, was a lawyer for the <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Fund</a> [corporate website] and was arrested in 2008 by <a href="http://eng.mvdrf.ru/">Russian Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in English] officials on suspicion of tax evasion after he accused the ministry of embezzling USD $230 million from the state. State prosecutors accused Magnitsky and Browder of evading $16.8 million in taxes. William Browder, a British investment fund boss, has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/11/us-russia-magnitsky-idUKBRE96A09V20130711">led a campaign to expose corruption</a> [Reuters report] and punish Russian officials, whom he blames for Magnitsky's death. Bowder was tried <em>in absentia</em> and sentenced to nine years in prison. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] stated that Magnitsky's conviction in Russia's first posthumous trial "set a dangerous precedent that could open a whole new chapter in Russia's worsening human rights record." 

<p>Magnitsky's death and posthumous trial caused a rift in Russia's relationship with the US. Last December US lawmakers passed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text] in the lawyer's name, which allows the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">Secretary of the Treasury</a> [official website] to freeze assets, prohibit all transactions and deny visas to Russians implicated in human rights abuses. In possible retaliation, Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in English; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that prohibits US citizens from adopting Russian children.

Kratov was the head of medical services at Butyrka Prison, where Magnitsky died from untreated pancreatitis.

The decision reversed Karadzic's <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icty-upholds-ten-charges-against-karadzic-dismisses-one.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] last year on one of the charges he faces, but this does not amount to a conviction. Presiding Judge Theodor Meron stated that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/un-judges-to-rule-on-prosecution-appeal-against-key-karadzic-genocide-acquittal/2013/07/11/0811b7bc-ea0d-11e2-818e-aa29e855f3ab_story.html">appeals judges believe</a> [AP report] that prosecution evidence from Karadzic's trial "could indicate that Karadzic possessed genocidal intent" during a campaign in 1992 aimed at driving Muslims and Croats out of towns and villages that Serbs claimed as their territory. The Appeals Chamber has remanded the matter to the Trial Chamber for further action consistent with the judgment.

<p>Karadzic has been accused, among other things, of participating in the planning of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/675945.stm">1995 Srebrenica Massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">news archive</a>], which resulted in the death of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys. In October Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/karadzic-opens-defense-before-icty.php">opened his defense</a> [JURIST report] in the ICTY by denying all charges against him. Earlier, in August, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/icty-denies-karadzic-request-for-new-trial.php">denied</a> Karadzic's request for a new trial after he argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/karadzic-asks-icty-for-new-war-crimes-trial.php">prosecution had failed to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] crucial information until after trial. The court reasoned that the delay in disclosing evidence had not infringed on Karadzic's right to a fair trial. In early June, the judges from the ICTY went on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/karadzic-judges-visit-srebrenica-massacre-site.php">five-day visit</a> [JURIST report] to locations relevant to the indictment of Karadzic. This visit came just months after the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/former-yugoslavia-municipal-officer-sentenced-to-2-years-for-refusing-to-testify.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former president of the municipality of Sokolac, BiH, Milan Tupajic to two months in prison for refusing to testify against Karadzic. In February 2012, former Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1423551.stm">Ratko Mladic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=RATKO+MLADIC">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/accused-war-criminal-yugoslavia-tribunal-biased.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the ICTY of being biased.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the petition, the attorneys argued that U.S. Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] did not rule directly on the constitutionality of <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's same-sex marriage ban. ADF further claimed that the state registrar under the authority of <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] lack the authority to order county clerks to issue same sex marriage licenses. "Any county that defies the federal court's injunction is at risk not only of contempt of court but also a lawsuit", <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Prop-8-backers-ask-court-to-stop-weddings-4662269.php">said Theodore Olson </a> [San Francisco Chronicle], a lawyer for the same-sex couples who challenged Proposition 8 in federal court.

Last month, ADF filed an <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/petition-filed-to-halt-same-sex-wedding-ceremonies.php">emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] stating the decision to lift California's ban on gay marriage was not legal and was decided prematurely.

Opponents of the bill, including <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/greater-texas/">Planned Parenthood of Texas</a> [advocacy website], offered twenty-one amendments to the bill ranging from exceptions for rape and incest to allowing doctors more leeway in prescribing abortion-inducing drugs. The bill will now be passed to <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] who had promised to sign the measure. 

<p>Texas is one of several states placing recent restrictions on abortions. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/senate/senate.html">North Carolina Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-senate-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] placing severe restrictions on abortion including shutting down most of the state's abortion's clinics, banning gender-selective abortions, restricting insurance coverage of abortions under the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [JURIST backgrounder], and requiring a doctor to be present both when an abortion procedure is performed and when a woman takes an abortion-inducing drug. Also this month, Wisconsin <a href=" http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wisconsin-governor-signs-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php ">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking abortions to have an ultrasound and banning doctors without admitting privileges at local hospitals from performing the procedures. Last April, Kansas <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kansas-governor-signs-anti-abortion-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] anti-abortion legislation into law prohibiting abortions based on the baby's sex, preventing abortion providers from receiving certain tax breaks and proclaiming that life begins at fertilization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The trade agency had issued the ban after deciding that Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility devices <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-12/microsoft-sues-u-s-customs-for-failed-google-phone-ban.html">infringed a Microsoft patent</a> [Bloomberg report] for a way mobile phones synchronize calendar events with other computers.

The complaint also named Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who stepped down from her position the same day to head the University of California system. 

<p>This is not the first legal action to arise from a Microsoft-Google conflict. In February US District Court Judge James Robart <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-restricts-google-patent-lawsuit-against-microsoft.php">restricted</a> [JURIST report] the patent lawsuit by Motorola Mobility against Microsoft, holding that certain parts of three different Motorola patents were not valid.

Prosecutors have reported that they are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/13/mohammed-morsi-accused_n_3591231.html">investigating complaints</a> [Reuters report] which include charges of spying, ruining the economy and inciting violence. The complaints, which were formally filed by an unidentified citizen, will allow Egyptian prosecutors to investigate and pursue criminal charges against Morsi. Prosecutors also noted Saturday that they have received additional complaints against Mohammed Badie, a spiritual leader of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-order-arrest-of-muslim-brotherhood-leader.php">accused of inciting violence</a> [JURIST report] last week. 

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked two weeks ago, after the Egyptian military deposed Mohamed Morsi, in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile], subsequently <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state. Only one day after Morsi was ousted, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] last Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities</a> [JURIST report] to address the escalating violence. According to the OHCHR more than 80 people have been killed and over 1000 injured since political turmoil gripped the nation two weeks ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ghulam Azam was <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/Top-Islamist-Ghulam-Azam-sentenced-to-90-years-in-jail-for-Bangladesh-war-crimes/articleshow/21085296.cms?">found guilty of five charges</a> [AFP report] of planning, conspiracy, incitement, complicity and murder during the war. He functioned as chief of JI in Bangladesh until 2000, but he maintains that the charges against him are politically motivated. Although prosecutors sought the death penalty for Azam, a government official said he was sentenced to 90 years because of his age and health.

<p>Ghulam Azam was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bangladesh-opposition-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">arrested by the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] in January 2012, after his preemptive request for bail was denied by the court. The ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-begins-first-trial.php">began its first trial</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011 for crimes against humanity committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The defendant in that trial was Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a former member of Parliament in the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">National Assembly of Bangladesh</a> [official website, in Bengali] and one of the former leaders of JI. Earlier that month, ICTB prosecutors <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-political-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed an application</a> [JURIST report] for formal charges against Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, a former leader of the <a href="http://bangladeshnationalistparty-bnp.org/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> [party website] who was also accused of crimes against humanity during the Liberation War. In May 2011, <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] sent a letter to the Bangladesh government praising its efforts through the ICTB to prosecute war crimes, but urging the government to ensure that the trials are carried out <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-further-amendments-to-bangladesh-international-crimes-tribunal.php">in accordance with international human rights expectations</a> [JURIST report].

Hill's attorney, Brian Kammer, issued a <a href="http://www.wptz.com/news/national/Court-stays-execution-of-Georgia-convict/-/8869978/20988396/-/aft1kaz/-/index.html">statement</a> [CNN report] Monday afternoon announcing that the court had decided to delay the execution in order to hold a briefing on Thursday to discuss whether the process surrounding Hill's execution violates the state's <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20132014/HB/122">Lethal Injection Secrecy Act</a> [HB 122 materials]. Kammer has also challenged Hill's execution on the grounds that his IQ, 70, makes him mentally disabled and, therefore, his execution would be cruel and unusual punishment based on the 2002 US Supreme Court decision <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [opinion], but the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] has not yet addressed his <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B__L0W5WUluVbU9CbnRTemVDVDg/edit">motion</a> [text, PDF] for stay of execution until the court resolves his pending petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>.

<p>Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 murder of a fellow inmate while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend in 1986, but his execution has been stayed several times. In February the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> and the <a href="http://www.gaappeals.us/">Court of Appeals of Georgia</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-and-state-courts-each-order-stay-of-execution-of-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">issued a stay</a> [JURIST report] on his execution minutes before it was scheduled to take place. The US Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-campaign-finance-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a motion for stay of execution and petition for <em>certiorari</em> hours before the Eleventh Circuit granted its stay. The Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">lifted the stay</a> [JURIST report] in April because it determined that the issue of mental retardation had already been presented and there was no issue as to his guilt or innocence on review. Last July the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-supreme-court-halts-warren-hill-execution.php">granted a stay</a> [JURIST report] on procedural grounds 90 minutes before Hill was scheduled to be executed. In a separate order, however, the same court denied his request to appeal a lower court ruling that he had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-court-declines-to-halt-execution-of-mentally-disabled-death-row-inmate.php">failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</a> [JURIST report] that he is mentally disabled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers for both defendants filed a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1544498.pdf">joint application</a> [text, PDF] on the grounds that transferring the case would make it more practical for them to maintain the duties of their active offices. Although there are already established ICC courts in both Kenya and Tanzania, the ICC extensively debated the request before denying it. In a press release Monday, the ICC stated that it just was not possible to provide the same resources in those facilities: "the Judges took into account numerous factors, such as security, the cost of holding proceedings outside The Hague, the potential impact on victims and witnesses." The trial is now set to open in The Hague.

<p>The defense request was filed in January under articles 3(3) and 62 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf#page=48">Rome Statute</a> and Rule 100 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Documents/RulesProcedureEvidenceEng.pdf#page=47">ICC Rules and Procedures of Evidence</a> [text, PDF], which provide for <em>in situ</em> hearings. Also facing trial is Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. Both trials were recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/kenya-presidents-war-crimes-trial-postponed.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until the fall. African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that current Kenyatta and Vice President Ruto be tried in Kenya after the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Kenyan Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] connecting Kenyatta and Ruto to the post-election violence. Earlier in May Kenya's ambassador to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed.

The report, "As Long as They Let Us Stay in Class: Barriers to Education for Persons with Disabilities in China," is based on more than 60 interviews with students with disabilities and their parents. Parents indicated that children with disabilities are excluded if they cannot adapt to the physical landscape of public schools and that they receive no individual accommodations if they are admitted. In most cases, public schools will only accept students with disabilities through middle school. While those students do have the option to attend a special needs public school, they are not very common and are often a source for social stigma. These establishments are contrary to multiple public policies, including some progressive steps taken by the <a href="http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_2792/">Ministry of Education</a> [official website], the <a href="http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/">China Disabled Persons' Federation</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [text], to which China is a signatory. According to HRW, such exclusionary actions can have life-long dire effects, as schools are required to notify universities of students' disabilities. HRW has called on the Chinese government to enforce its policies on inclusion-based educational settings.

<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/topic/disability-rights">Equality for people with disabilities</a> [HRW backgrounder] is an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=disabilities">ongoing challenge around the world</a> [JURIST news archive]. The US has also struggled to create a universally inclusive education system, although there are multiple statutes in place to encourage equality. Most recently, the Department of Education has held that students with disabilities must be given <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-schools-must-allow-disabled-students-to-compete-in-extracurricular-sports.php">equal opportunities in intramural sports</a> [JURIST report] regardless of their capabilities. In 2009 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/high-court-upholds-tuition.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> [text], permits a tuition reimbursement award against a school district and in favor of parents who unilaterally place their child in private school, where the child had not previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency. The <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> [text] (ADA) of 1990 stands as the federal minimum on acceptable practices. Other countries have followed suit by creating their own statutes to fall in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The FISC also mandated that actual Yahoo metadata collected by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] pursuant to the 2008 FISC order be declassified. Monday's order, however, provides the government the opportunity to redact information it deems sensitive to national security, leading many to <a href="http://rt.com/news/yahoo-data-collection-court-case-165/">question</a> [Reuters report] how forthcoming the government will be when conducting its declassification review. Yahoo filed its motion in the FISC on June 14 seeking to clear its name in the wake of allegedly erroneous media reports implicating it in recent controversies over NSA surveillance programs. FISA gives the FISC authority to order tech companies to disclose user data but prohibits publication with respect to whether the FISC has issued such an order.

<p>Revelations surrounding US government surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in the FISC supporting efforts by Google and Microsoft to publish data concerning how many times the government invoked federal law to request user information for national security purposes. Also last week a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging the NSA illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" in the wake of 9/11. In July the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order. Also in June Several US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring and a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. The US government has <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former government contractor Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">found guilty</a> on 18 charges of corruption in his second trial and ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-sentenced-to-14-years.php">sentenced to a 14-year prison term</a> [JURIST reports]. He has served 16 months in a federal prison in Chicago. The appeal alleges that there was a problem with a member of the jury who showed bias against Blagojevich, as well as with the actions of the judge. Blagojevich's legal team filed in June for permission to submit an appeal of unusual length, due to the complexities of the trial. The final appeal is more than 100 pages long.  

<p>Lawyers first <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-to-appeal-conviction.php">filed notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] in June 2011. Blagojevich was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial, including charges for racketeering. In January 2009 the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on corruption charges, including allegations that they conspired to sell the Senate seat left vacant by US President Barack Obama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Wickham Corwin of the <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/counties/cass.htm">Cass County District Court</a> [official website] had announced his intention to strike down the law following a three-day trial in April, and he issued his <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013-07-15_MKBvBurdick_Perm_Injunction.pdf">58-page ruling</a> [text, PDF] on Monday. Corwin found that the law creates an "insurmountable barrier" to abortion and fails to adequately protect women's reproductive rights. The abortion law, which Corwin first <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-dakota-court-temporarily-blocks-medical-abortion-law.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST report] in 2011, would prevent women from taking the abortion drug Mifeprex after seven weeks and would require women to take a second abortion drug at a clinic rather than taking it at home. The law would also increase the price of abortion drugs by 40 percent. North Dakota <a href="http://www.ag.state.nd.us/About/Wayne.htm">Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-07-16/nd-judge-2011-abortion-law-unconstitutional">plans to appeal the ruling</a> [AP report] to the <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> [official website].

The plaintiffs argue that Amendment 83 to the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/Summary/ArkansasConstitution1874.pdf">Arkansas Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which reads, "Marriage consists only of the union of one man and one woman," violates their rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. Two of the couples applied for marriage licenses in Pulaski County but were turned down. The third couple is legally married in New York, but their marriage is not recognized by the Arkansas government. The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/default.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas</a> [official website], names <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Mike Beebe</a>, <a href="http://www.ag.arkansas.gov/">Attorney General Dustin McDaniel</a> [official websites] and Pulaski County Circuit Clerk Larry Crane as defendants.

<p>The lawsuit, and a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">similar suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban, comes in the wake of the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional.

Judge Steven McAuliffe <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/07/15/n-h-woman-gets-10-years-in-rwanda-fraud-case/">imposed the maximum sentence</a> [AP report] for her crimes. Munyenyezi was convicted in February of having gained her US citizenship by hiding her identity and her affiliation with the Hutu tribe, despite the fact that her husband was a known leader in the Hutu militia. Munyenyezi served as a guard at a checkpoint where she detained Tutsis who would be killed by the Hutu militia. The judge found that the role she played amounted to that of an active participant in the genocide. While witnesses testified, she sat silently, and declined to comment or grant interviews after her sentence was announced. Munyenyezi's husband and mother-in-law were both convicted, and are serving life sentences for their role in the genocide. Munyenyezi was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/beatrice-munyenyezi-sentenced_n_3600409.html">stripped of her citizenship</a> [AP report] at the time of her conviction, but her lawyers say that this sentence saves her from being deported back to Rwanda, where she would surely be killed.  

<p>After the Rwandan genocide that took the lives of 800,000 people, international and domestic courts have attempted to try those responsible. In June, <a href="http://worldjusticeproject.org/bio/honorary-chair/honorable-justice-jallow">Justice Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [WJP profile], prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] reiterated the UN Security Council's request for member states to help <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ictr-prosecutor-urges-member-states-to-assist-in-locating-rwanda-fugitives.php">bring to justice</a> [JURIST report] nine fugitives allegedly responsible for war crimes during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In April French law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan leader Tite Barahira for conspiracy to commit genocide. In March a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/dutch-court-convicts-woman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yvonne Basebya of inciting genocide after finding that she led meetings of a radical Hutu party and sang a song that called for the murder of all Tutsis. Basebya was sentenced to six years in prison. In February a court in Norway <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] a Rwandan man living in Oslo for acting as an accomplice to the genocide. The court sentenced him to 21 years in prison. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision upheld Scrushy's 2006 conviction of exchanging $500,000 with former Alabama governor <a href="http://www.donsiegelman.org/Pages/MAIN/aboutdon.html">Don Siegelman</a> [personal profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Siegelman">news archive</a>] for a seat on Alabama's <a href="http://www.shpda.state.al.us/boards/conrblisting.aspx?sm=b_a">Certificate of Need Review Board</a> [official website]. Scrushy was appealing a 2009 denial of his motion for a new trial, and recusal of the trial judge arguing that the "rulings constituted an abuse of discretion." The Eleventh Circuit ruled on five of the six grounds on which Scrushy sought a new trial. Among the claims denied was the assertion by Scrushy that the prosecution's failure to disclose a juror's romantic interest in a FBI special agent involved in the case was "prosecutorial misconduct." The Eleventh Circuit dismissed the allegation, stating that, "the assertion that a mere expression of attraction would infect the jury's decision with bias strains credulity." Scrushy was released from federal custody in July 2012.

<p>In 2011 the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/elventh-circuit-strikes-bribery-charges-against-ex-governor-ex-healthsouth-ceo.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] two bribery charges against Siegelman and Scrushy.

United States</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST report]. Siegelman and Scrushy were convicted in 2006 on federal bribery and corruption charges. The convictions were appealed, and Siegelman had two counts of mail fraud reversed for lack of evidence. The court of appeals later <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/eleventh-circuit-denies-alabama-ex.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by Siegelman and Scrushy for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing of their convictions on charges of corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ICC has faced difficulties in enforcing its arrest warrant against al-Bashir, in part because of the lack of support by neighbor states.

The woman, <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2013/07/15/trans-woman-wins-employment-discrimination-suit-using-civil-rights">who has not been publicly identified</a> [Advocate report], filed a complaint last year under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text]. The EEOC held that the woman's supervisors violated Title VII by failing to intervene upon learning of the harassment, therefore creating a hostile work environment. In 2012 the EEOC held that "intentional discrimination against a transgender individual because that person is transgender, is, by definition, discrimination 'based on ... sex." Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex.

<p>The EEOC first extended gender identity Title VII protection in 2012 to <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/news/?ak=7288">Mia Macy</a> [Metroweekly report], a qualified transgender woman whose job offer was rescinded by the <a href="http://www.atf.gov">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> (ATF) [official website] once the agency learned of Macy's transgender status. Macy initially filed a complaint with ATF's equal employment office, which denied the request because transgender discrimination was not protected under Title VII. Macy appealed the decision to the EEOC where the commissioners <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt">held </a> [opinion] that transgender discrimination was prohibited under the Act. That ruling was <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/726679/doj-decision-redacted.pdf">adopted</a> [decision, PDF] by the Department of Justice last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Nasaka have been accused of numerous humans rights violations against the local Rohingya population, including extrajudicial killings and torture. The move comes following a March <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.58_AUV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by Quintana recommending the government "fundamentally reform this border security force and, in the meantime, suspend all of Nasaka's operations in Rakhine State." The Special Rapporteur, while welcoming the development, warned that  "the abolition of Nasaka should not mean that the credible allegations of widespread and systematic human rights violations committed by its members are not properly investigated and the perpetrators held to account." Quintana voiced the strong need for accountability in future border forces to prevent the recurrence of human rights violations. 

<p>Concern over Myanmar's sectarian violence and human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] demanded that the government of Myanmar do more to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-chief-urges-myanmar-to-combat-ethnic-and-religious-discrimination.php">combat religious and ethnic discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against minorities or risk undermining the reform movement in the country. In May Quintana released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-for-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">welcoming recommendations</a> [JURIST report] by the Myanmar government's Rakhine Investigation Commission but at the same time also voicing a strong need for the government to address impunity and ensure investigations into credible allegations of systematic human rights violations against Muslims in Rakhine state. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] demanded that the Myanmar government investigate and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/myanmar-government-urged-to-provide-justice-for-attacks-on-muslim-community.php">hold accountable</a> [JURIST report] those involved in the deadly violence in the Mandalay Region in March, in which an estimated 40 people were killed and 61 more were wounded. Also in April Quintana expressed serious <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">concerns</a> [JURIST report] in a report on growing violence between Muslim and Buddhist communities in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that government inaction has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The tribunal said that the prosecution failed to prove two of the charges against Mojaheed, while five charges were proven beyond doubt. Defense attorneys have stated that they plan to appeal the verdict against Mojaheed.

<p>Earlier this week, Ghulam Azam, chief of JI in Bangladesh until 2000, was also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-90-years-for-war-crimes.php">found guilty by the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] of five charges of planning, conspiracy, incitement, complicity and murder during the war.

The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website] gave final approval of the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0003/cbill_2013-20140003_en_1.htm">Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill</a> [HC Bill 3] on Tuesday. The original legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-government-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">introduced in January</a> [JURIST report] and will effectively extend the application of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/contents">Marriage Act of 1949</a> [materials] to same-sex as well as opposite-sex couples. The law will allow an exception for any religious institutions that do not wish to perform same-sex weddings. Same-sex couples in England and Wales have been permitted to enter into civil partnerships since 2005, allowing them to receive many of the same legal rights as married opposite-sex couples. The new law, however, will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21194052">officially enable</a> [BBC report] same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies by a consenting religious institution. It will also allow same-sex couples already in civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website], who also serves as the Leader of the <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">Conservative Party</a> [official website], has strongly supported the bill. His support has <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">created tension</a> [JURIST report] within the Conservative Party.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a controversial issue internationally. Last month the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in two landmark same-sex marriage cases. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court ruled that the petitioners lacked standing to appeal the district court's order striking down <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's same-sex marriage ban. In May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/france-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption-bill.php">France legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage and established the right of same-sex couples to adopt. Also in May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/brazil-justice-council-effectively-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Brazil legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage in a court ruling that prevented notaries from denying to perform ceremonies for same-sex couples. In the same month, same-sex marriage legislation was approved in the US states of <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Minnesota</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Delaware</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports].

The petitioners maintained that the practice was cruel and that it would interfere with their religious practices during the month of Ramadan, which began on July 8 and requires fasting during daylight hours. In her opinion, Judge Rosemary Collyer found that the court does not have jurisdiction to decide the case. She also noted that even if the court had jurisdiction, she would not have granted the order, saying: "there is nothing so shocking or inhumane in the treatment of Petitioners&#8212;which they can avoid at will&#8212;to raise a constitutional concern that might otherwise necessitate review." Collyer also pointed out that the Guantanamo staff had plans to accommodate the petitioners' religious needs during Ramadan. 

<p>A judge in a similar case also ruled last week that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-denies-petition-to-end-force-feeding-of-guantanamo-hunger-strikers.php">federal courts do not have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over the forced-feeding issue. Several hunger striking detainees <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-prisoners-ask-federal-court-to-order-end-to-force-feedings.php">filed motions</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month alleging that the practice violates human rights law and medical ethics, while serving "no penological interest." Currently, there are 166 detainees at the Guantanamo prison, of which 46 are classified as <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-government-releases-names-of-indefinite-guantanamo-detainees.php">indefinite detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Last month a federal judge called on members of Congress and President Barack Obama to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo Bay detainee cases. Just days prior Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo, but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The five billion dollar lawsuit accuses S&#38;P of misrepresenting the credit risk of complex financial products including <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/mortgagesecurities.htm">residential mortgage backed securities</a> (RMBS) [SEC backgrounder] and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/11/24/magazines/fortune/eavis_cdo.fortune/">collateralized debt obligations</a> (CDO) [CNN backgrounder]. According to the court opinion, under the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/8000-3100.html">Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989</a> (FIRREA) [text], the government seeks to obtain civil penalties for S&#38;P's violations of three criminal fraud statutes: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341">18 USC &#167; 1341</a> (mail fraud); <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343">18 USC &#167; 1343</a> (wire fraud); and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1344">18 USC &#167; 1344(1), (2)</a> (financial institution fraud) [texts].  

<p>The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/849201325104924250796.PDF">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/credit-rating-agency-sued-for-inflating-credit-ratings-during-housing-crisis.php">report</a>] in February. S&#38;P assessed the credit risk of structured financial instruments, such as RMBSs and CDOs, and assigned securities with ratings that described the associated risk. The complaint alleges that these ratings were inflated when they were relied upon by investors including many federally insured financial institutions. Further, the DOJ alleged that "S&#38;P falsely represented that its ratings were objective, independent, and uninfluenced by S&#38;P's relationships with investment banks when, in actuality, S&#38;P's desire for increased revenue and market share led it to favor the interests of these banks over investors." A key claim in the complaint is that the ratings are purchased by the institutions holding the securities under review, creating an alleged conflict of interest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Xu was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/08/24/china-advocates-freed-restrictions-civil-society-remain">previously detained</a> [HRW report]  by Chinese police in 2009 on charges of tax evasion. Coinciding with Xu's arrest, earlier this week Wang Wenzhi, a reporter for the official <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/">Xinhua News Agency</a> [official website], accused <a href="http://www.crc.com.hk/eng2012/">China Resources (Holdings)</a> chairman Song Lin of corruption.

<p>The detainment of Chinese activists has been a recurrent human rights issue in China, along with accusations of corruption within the Chinese government.

The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for 2012</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF] affirms the president's authority under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:S.J.RES.23.ENR:">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text] to detain indefinitely any person who has been "part of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces." The court ruled that the plaintiffs&#8212;seven individuals, some US citizens and some non-US citizens, and one organization&#8212;lacked standing because they could not show personal danger of being affected by the law. It concluded that the law "has no bearing on the government's authority to detain the American citizen plaintiffs" and that the non-US citizens failed to "establish a sufficient basis to fear detention under the statute." The court did, however, note that the plaintiffs "raise(d) a number of important and difficult questions," leaving open the question of whether the lawsuit would succeed on its merits if it is brought later by plaintiffs with standing.

<p>This appeal was brought by the US government defendants after a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-enjoins-indefinite-detention-law.php">permanently enjoined</a> [JURIST report] the law in September. That court had <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-blocks-portion-of-anti-terrorism-law.php">issued an injunction</a> against the law months earlier and later clarified that the injunction should be <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-clarifies-injunction-on-anti-terrorism-law--dnp.php">interpreted broadly</a> [JURIST reports]. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/barackobama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">signed the NDAA into law</a> [JURIST report] in December 2011 despite criticism from groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website], which released a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-law">statement</a> [text] the day before it was signed saying that the law was dangerous due to its breadth. The bill had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">unanimously approved</a> by the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] after some controversy over many of its key provisions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/nsa-spying_n_3606847.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">seeks an injunction</a> [AP report] against the NSA, Justice Department, FBI and directors of the agencies for allegedly violating plaintiffs' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right of association, as well as their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, by illegally collecting various call records. The EFF filed the lawsuit on behalf of a coalition of 19 organizations, including Unitarian church groups and gun ownership advocates. EFF legal director Cindy Cohn <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/unitarian-church-gun-groups-join-eff-sue-nsa-over-illegal-surveillance">stated</a> [press release], "The First Amendment protects the freedom to associate and express political views as a group, but the NSA's mass, untargeted collection of Americans' phone records violates that right by giving the government a dramatically detailed picture into our associational ties." 

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA's surveillance programs have sparked recent worldwide debate and controversy. Last week a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected a motion to dismiss a putative class action lawsuit that was filed by the EFF in 2008. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">lawsuit alleged</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" after <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In July the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA had been collecting call data from Verizon customers under a secret court order. Also in June several US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] a review of the government's surveillance activity. This request came in light of reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring, as well as a criminal investigation into the activities of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22837100">Edward Snowden</a> [BBC profile], a former government contractor who came forward as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. The US government <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the same time frame, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA, challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The searches at issue are being conducted any time a detainee is transported to the area for meeting with counsel regarding <em>habeas corpus</em> matters. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] last week <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012mc0398-46">ordered</a> [order, memorandum <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012mc0398-47">opinion</a>] Guantanamo guards to limit their searches to "grasping the waistband of the detainee's trousers and shaking the pants to dislodge any contraband." The US, however, filed an <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/07/17/us-appeals-guantanamo-genital-search-ban.html?comp=700001075741&rank=2">emergency motion</a> [AP report] with the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Wednesday asking it to delay enforcement of the order due to security issues. The court <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=203014527">granted the motion</a> [AP report] later that day in a short order that did not elaborate on the court's reasoning. The government had argued in its motion that a ruling restricting security procedures at a military prison facility was unprecedented, but defendants' attorneys, as well as the district court, have argued that detainees have a right to meet with counsel without being forced to submit to searches that may be abhorrent to their religious beliefs.

<p>Last month a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo detainee cases. Just days prior, Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo, but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own. In contrast, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the 2014 <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF] in early June, which allocates more than 200 million dollars to keep the detention center open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN had pressed the president to improve the election commission he had threatened to disperse after it disqualified 25 percent of the 2009 ballots, sparking violence across the country. By reinvigorating the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/">Independent Election Commission</a> [official website] and establishing an independent commission for voting complaints, the UN is hoping for a peaceful democratic transition when Karzai steps down from office, as a genuine democratic election is a prerequisite for billions of dollars in foreign aide through the UN. Although the composition of the commissions has not yet been determined, the law provides for a committee of human rights activists, UN experts and other specialists to appoint the members of each. The UN Deputy Special Representative to Afghanistan, <a href="http://cic.nyu.edu/content/nicholas-haysom">Nicholas Haysom</a> [NYU profile], <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/world/asia/with-new-law-afghanistan-moves-closer-to-an-election.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0">expressed cautious optimism</a> [NYT report] about the news laws.

<p>The <a href="http://wj.parliament.af/english.aspx">Afghan Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/afghan-lawmakers-approve-new-electoral-law.php">approved the new laws</a> [JURIST report] in May. These developments come as a direct result of an April 2012 Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan (IEC) announcement that it would change the country's parliamentary election proceedings in an effort to eliminate future fraud. That announcement was the result of problems with the previous election and nearly led to the dissolution of the IEC after its decisions sparked widespread violence in 2009. In August 2011 Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/afghanistan-election-commission-proposes-voting-changes-to-prevent-fraud.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the special elections court that he had created to investigate election fraud in parliamentary elections. The court was criticized as a vehicle for overturning the electoral gains made by many of Karzai's political opponents. In June 2011 the court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/afghan-court-overturns-parliamentary-election-results-for-fraud.php">invalidated the election results</a> [JURIST Report] of nearly 25 percent of the assembly seats. Karzai then ordered that the seating of parliament be <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-president-orders-delay-in-seating-of-new-parliament.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] by a month in order to further investigate the findings. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the new law broadens the scope of industries that can participate in union practices, it also places a high standard on the steps required to form a union in all industries. According to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/15/bangladesh-amended-labor-law-falls-short">law requires that a union receive signatures</a> [HRW report] in support of its practice from 30 percent of the workforce in one plant. HRW claims that this threshhold can be nearly impossible in the garment industry, where one production site may employ thousands. While lawmakers have touted the law as a landmark in workers' rights, labor unions and rights organizations have criticized for making those rights effectively unobtainable. Critics are accusing Bangladesh of passing the law only to appease the US, which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/business/us-to-suspend-trade-privileges-with-bangladesh-officials-say.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">suspended the trade preferences</a> [NYT report] of the world's second largest garment exporter due to concerns over unsafe working conditions three weeks ago. HRW deputy director of the Asian region Phil Robertson commented, "This would be good news if the new law fully met international standards, but the sad reality is that the government has consciously limited basic workers' rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation." The controversial law's affect on trade with the US remains to be seen. 

<p>These changes come in an effort to update the Bangladeshi laws to meet international standards. Bangladesh has ratified most of the core <a href="http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/promoting-international-labor-standards/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> [official website] labor standards, including Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and Convention No. 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. According to the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html">World Factbook</a>, garment exports totaled USD $12.3 billion in 2009 and $11 billion in 2010, accounted for almost 12 percent of GDP. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Song's statement marked International Criminal Justice Day, July 17, which was the date that the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] was signed in 1998, officially creating the ICC. Song declared that although the court has brought many criminals to justice in its 15-year existence, the international community needs to do more to ensure that the ICC functions properly:<blockquote>While we have come a long way, we cannot afford complacency. Make no mistake&#8212;the ICC faces threats today as real as ever before. There are those who seek to undermine the international justice movement, who politicise its action, who question its value, and who purport to speak for the victims it serves. There are those who refuse to cooperate, leaving more than ten ICC suspects still at large.</blockquote>Song also emphasized that international criminal justice is a fundamental human value rather than the product of any particular culture.

<p>The <a href="/feature/2013/07/international-criminal-court.php">ICC</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has recently grappled with challenging human rights issues in Africa. Earlier this week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-urges-nigeria-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Nigerian authorities to arrest and surrender Sudanese <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16010445">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed in the Darfur conflict. The ICC has faced difficulties in enforcing its arrest warrant against al-Bashir, in part because of the lack of support by neighbor states. Also this week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to change the forum of their trials to Kenya or Tanzania. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Joshua Sang and William Ruto</a> [ICC materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ruto">news archive</a>] are accused of inciting violence after the 2007 presidential election, in which 1,100 people died. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Navalny, a strong critic of <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] and a crusader against alleged governmental corruption, declared that the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/07/201273115211951682.html">charges against him were baseless</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The verdict against Navalny <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23352688">drew criticism</a> [BBC report] from his supporters, who contend that the proceedings were politically motivated. US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul denounced Navalny's conviction as the product of political motivation. Navalny's aides said that they will appeal the ruling. 

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently. In June the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-concerned-russia-ngos-being-unfairly-targeted-by-prosecutors.php">released a letter</a> [JURIST report] from human rights experts voicing their concern that two Russian non-governmental organizations have been charged by Russian prosecutors following their involvement with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/index.htm">UN Committee against Torture</a> [official website].

Human rights groups have criticized Russia's recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">foreign agents law</a> [JURIST report] since its adoption last November.

Speaking in San Juan, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2013/ag-speech-130717.html">announced the details</a> [press conference] of the agreement, which include creating a new task force, supported by 26 local task force officers, to enhance gun and drug interdiction efforts on the island. This agreement will require the PRPD to implement a variety of policies and practices related to ethical and responsible policing, police training, the use of force, searches and seizures, equal protection and non-discrimination, and community engagement. The DOJ is contributing $10 million in asset forfeiture funds to defray the cost of modernizing and reforming the PRPD. The agreement, a joint commitment, resolves the civil suit initiated by the department.

<p>In 2008, the Civil Rights Division <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/prpd_complaint_12-21-12.pdf">opened an investigation</a> [complaint, PDF] of the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) pursuant to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:H.R.3355:">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</a>, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.3355:">Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968</a> and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/titlevistat.php">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [texts]. Following its comprehensive investigation, the DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/prpd_letter.pdf">announced its findings</a> [text, PDF] in September 2011 that the PRPD has engaged in patterns of misconduct that violate the Constitution and federal law, finding: use of excessive force; use of unreasonable force and other misconduct designed to suppress the exercise of protected First Amendment rights; and unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/doj-condemns-unconstitutional-conduct-of-puerto-rico-police.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the PRPD for number of long-standing and entrenched systemic deficiencies within the PRPD that caused or contributed to these patterns of misconduct. In June 2012 the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-against-puerto-rico-police-department.php">filed another lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the PRPD, alleging that they violated the rights of protesters.

The court concluded that the president's 
three January 4, 2012, appointments to the Board are constitutionally infirm because the appointments were not made during "the Recess of the Senate" under the the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Recess Appointments Clause</a> [Art. II, &#167; 5, cl. 4 text] of the US Constitution. The decision invalidates the NLRB rulings that <a href="http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d458079024d">Enterprise Leasing Company Southeast</a> and <a href="http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4580bab136">Huntington Ingalls, Inc.</a> [opinions, PDF] violated federal labor law by refusing to bargain with unions certified by the board to represent the companies' employees. The court is the third federal appeals court to find that the appointments were unconstitutional.

<p>In June the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-recess-appointments.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to review the constitutionality of the president's recess power and whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in <em>pro forma</em> sessions. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the recess appointment of three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) [official website] by Obama was unconstitutional, and the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/obama-petitions-supreme-court-on-recess-appointments.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by a bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Washington state challenging the NLRB after the Board affirmed a decision that the distributor violated the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text]. In May the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://images.politico.com/global/2013/05/16/third-circuit-nlrb-opinion.html">issued an opinion</a> [text, PDF] mirroring the reasoning from the DC Circuit. In addition, two business advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/two-business-groups-challenge-obamas-recess-appointments.php">filed motions</a> contesting the constitutionality of the president's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/doj-defends-obamas-recess-appointments.php">recess appointments</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2012. The motions were filed in relation to the groups' ongoing suit challenging the NLRB mandate that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nlrb-orders-union-rights-posted-in-us-businesses.php">rights to unionize</a> [JURIST report] be posted in all workplaces. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] defended the use of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BP\W%3B%20P%20%20%0A">recess appointments</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] by Obama immediately after his announcement. Some experts argue that recess appointments have <a href="/forum/2011/12/victor-williams-recess-appointments.php">regularly been used by presidents</a> [JURIST op-ed] since George Washington. It is only a relatively recent practice that obstructionists have begun holding perfunctory pro forma sessions every three days while the Senate is on recess in order to block recess appointments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ATM Azharul Islam was required to report to the International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh (ICTB) to answer charges of murder, genocide, abduction, torture, rape, looting and arson. Azharul was a member of the student party Islami Chhatra Sangha in 1971, and served as the district unit president of that organization, which is sponsored by his current party, <a href="http://jamaat.org/beta/site/index/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website]. Investigators told the press that they <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/20137189331725240.html">recently visited scenes of crimes</a> [Al Jazeera report] that occurred during the revolution and collected evidence against the politician. His party has not yet published a public response or indicated their next steps. 

<p>This development comes on the heels of the conviction of one of the party's leaders on related charges. Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, the party's secretary-general and Azharul's direct superior, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-death-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday for war crimes committed during the 1971 uprising. Earlier this week, Ghulam Azam, chief of JI in Bangladesh until 2000, was also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-90-years-for-war-crimes.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTB of five charges of planning, conspiracy, incitement, complicity and murder during the war. The ICTB began its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-begins-first-trial.php">first trial</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011 for crimes against humanity committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The defendant in that trial was Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a former member of <a href="http://bangladeshnationalistparty-bnp.org/">Parliament in the National Assembly of Bangladesh</a> [official website, in Bengali] and one of the former leaders of JI. Earlier that month, ICTB prosecutors filed an <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-political-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">application</a> [JURIST report] for formal charges against Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, a former leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party [party website], who was also accused of crimes against humanity during the Liberation War. In May 2011 <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] sent a letter to the Bangladesh government praising its efforts through the ICTB to prosecute war crimes, but urging the government to ensure that the trials are <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-further-amendments-to-bangladesh-international-crimes-tribunal.php">carried out in accordance with international human rights expectations</a> [JURIST report]. The ICTB was first <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to handle war crime charges stemming from the 1971 war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Led by <a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/moudeina.html">Jacqueline Moudeina</a> [Right Livelihood profile], a human rights litigator, nearly 300 applicants claim to be direct victims of Habre, while hundreds more are applying for status based on the rights of deceased family members. Five of the applicants <a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/world/victims-to-support-trial-of-ex-chad-ruler/article_74387cf1-60c9-59cd-9a52-100c2979fabc.html">described</a> [AP report] the ordeals they endured to the court in Senegal, and requested that the court establish a benefit fund for survivors. Habre's counsel responded by accusing the opposition of making a move for sympathy to bias the court, noting that the organizations acting on behalf of the victims receive gratuitous funding from the same political parties that removed Habre from office. The court has not yet indicated how it will respond to the large number of applications. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">Habre</a> [JURIST news archive] was charged by Senegalese prosecutors earlier this month with war crimes, torture and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/former-chad-dictator-charged-with-war-crimes.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Known as "Africa's Pinochet," the former Chadian dictator must answer claims that members of his tightly managed Secret Service tortured and killed up to 40,000 people during his reign from 1982-90. Habre is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23153532">first African leader</a> [BBC report] to face charges of crimes against humanity in a fellow African country. The <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website] began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

These changes require physicians performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles and the facility to meet ambulatory surgical center requirements, and reduces the allowable gestational period from 24 to 20 weeks, among more than one dozen smaller changes to regulations. The enactment of the law sparked <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/18/perry-signs-abortion-bill-law/">protests</a> [<em>Texas Tribune</em> report]. Perry maintained that the changes were made to <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/speech/18757/">protect women</a> [speech]. However, opposition leaders, including state senator <a href="http://www.davis.senate.state.tx.us/">Wendy Davis</a> [official website], argue that such upgrades impose an undue burden. Thus, instead of improving health options for women in abortion clinics, <a href="http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/832/pdf/83S207-12-F.PDF#page=2">opponents of the new laws argue</a> [legislative record] it will limit availability of the clinics because so few can afford the upgrades.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=texas">Texas</a> [JURIST news archive] is one of several states placing recent restrictions on abortions. <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/abortion.php">standards of the new law</a> [JURIST news archive].

It also ruled that its forum is more appropriate than the Libyan forum because of the accused's stated preference, genuine fear of bias, and the scope of crimes alleged by each prosecutor. The scope of the ICC's allegations is broader than those stated in the Libyan charges, and allows for a wider spectrum of evidence. The ICC ruled that the Libyan government failed to show how his appearance in the ICC would create an irreversible situation or one that one would be difficult to reverse, as is required for the court to order such relief in a request to suspend appearance.

Navalny and his co-defendant, Petr Ofitserovon, were freed pending appeal on the condition that they not travel outside Moscow. Widespread <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23352688">protests erupted</a> [BBC report] in several Russian cities after Navalny's guilty verdict was announced, which may have contributed to his release. Navalny first became visible in 2011 as one of the leaders of street demonstrations against parliamentary elections allegedly rigged by the Kremlin. Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian], announced that he was reconsidering running for mayor of Moscow on September 8. 

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently. In June the UN released a letter from <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-concerned-russia-ngos-being-unfairly-targeted-by-prosecutors.php">human rights experts voicing their concern</a> [JURIST report] that two Russian non-governmental organizations have been charged by Russian prosecutors following their involvement with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CAT/Pages/CATIndex.aspx">UN Committee against Torture</a> [official website]. In May a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/russia-court-rejects-appeal-by-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by members of the feminist punk group <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] against their sentence for a protest against Putin. Earlier in May the EU <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/137151.pdf">expressed concern</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/eu-concerned-over-russia-human-rights-record.php&#8221;>report</a>] with Russia's human rights record Sunday, focusing on the country's recent adoption of restrictive legislation, the prosecution of political activists and efforts towards establishing an independent judiciary. Human rights groups have criticized Russia's recent <a href="/dateline/2013/05/shubin-nikita-russian-law.php">foreign agents law</a> [JURIST report] since its adoption last November. The law requires non-governmental organizations and non-commercial organizations to register as foreign agents if they engage in any political activity or receive foreign funding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hobby Lobby and its sister company, Mardel, have argued that that having to provide every form of birth control would violate their religious beliefs. The US Department of Justice has argued that contraception coverage is needed to promote public health and gender equality. Heaton stayed the case until October 1 to give the federal government time to consider an appeal. 

<p>At the moment there are numerous lawsuits challenging the health care law's mandate, but Hobby Lobby is the leading proponent for challenging the providing of contraceptives under the PPACA. In June the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/12/12-6294.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Hobby Lobby <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">may challenge the mandate</a> [JURIST report] to provide employees with coverage for contraceptives under PPACA. In May Hobby Lobby <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/tenth-circuit-hears-hobby-lobby-appeal-of-health-care-ruling.php">requested an exemption</a> [JURIST report] from the mandate. In February a group of nine senators and two representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-legislators-join-hobby-lobby-in-challenge-to-contraception-mandate.php">joined to file</a> [JURIST report] an <em>amicus</em> brief in support of Hobby Lobby and Mardel. In December Hobby Lobby and Mardel announced that they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">not comply</a> [JURIST report] with Justice Sonia Sotomayor's order that the companies provide employees with coverage under the PPACA. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/nmcca.htm">Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals</a> (CCA) [official website] <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/newcaaf/opinions/2010SepTerm/10-5003.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] holding that while the attorney-client relationship had been improperly severed, Hutchins was not prejudiced. In reversing the CCA decision, the court also held that the <a href="http://www.ncis.navy.mil/Pages/publicdefault.aspx">Naval Criminal Investigative Services</a>'s (NCIS) [official website] request to Hutchins for his consent to search his belongings was in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The ruling set aside the findings and the sentence, and remanded the case to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Under the military justice system, Hutchins could not be freed until the court ruled on a Navy motion in response to the court's decision. Sgt. Hutchins has served half of an 11-year sentence for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, making a false official statement and larceny for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad in Hamdania [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdania">news archive</a>] in Al Anbar province.

<p>In 2012 the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-to-review-us-marine-murder-conviction.php">decided to hear</a> [JURIST report] Sgt. Hutchins' appeal. In 2010 a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-military-judge-releases-marine-cleared-of-killing-iraqi-civilian.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Sgt. Hutchins, two months after his conviction for killing an Iraqi citizen was reversed by the Navy-Marine Court for Criminal Appeals, citing lack of a fair trial. In 2008 the US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-reduces-sentence-for-marine.php">reduced the sentence</a> [JURIST report] of Sgt. Hutchins to 11 years in detention and a rank reduction to Private before being dishonorably discharged. In 2007 a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">sentenced Sgt.

The lawsuit challenges a 2011 statute that gives police the option to investigate the immigration status of certain suspects. Should it be determined that someone is in the country illegally, police are also empowered to detail them. Judge Thomas Thrash's most recent <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-georgias-immigrati/nYxHh/">decision</a> [AJC report] allows the current Georgia immigration law to continue to be enforced.

<p>In March the <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx">Georgia General Assembly</a> [official website] amended <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20132014/135275.pdf">Senate Bill 160</a> [text, PDF], implementing stricter security and immigration compliance than the original 2011 version. That month Thrash <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php?edition=world">permanently blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an illegal immigrant during the course of any other crime, reasoning that the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit already held that this portion of Georgia's immigration law was preempted by federal law. In addition, Thrash ordered the state to inform Georgia's law enforcement agencies of his decision so that state agencies do not enforce that provision of the immigration law. The provision would have carried a punishment of up to 12 months in prison and fines of up to $1,000. The lawsuit was brought into federal court by civil and immigrant rights groups who argued that the provision was unconstitutional. In December Thrash  <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">lifted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The unanimous ruling marks the first time a state supreme court has recognized a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] protection for cell phone location data. In the decision, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner noted that cellphone tracking technology has the potential to violate a person's privacy rights and must be subject to judicial review. Rabner also noted that no warrants will be required in emergency situations. 

<p>Courts and lawmakers remain divided on what types of warrants are required to perform cell phone searches.

In her statement, Bensouda further warned that ICC "will not hesitate to prosecute those alleged to have committed such war crimes." The UN previously noted this attack is one of the most serious attacks against the peacekeepers since their deployment, bringing the total number of UNAMID peacekeepers killed since 2007 to 54.

Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said that Detroit's bankruptcy filing violates the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/historical/miconstitution1850.htm">Michigan Constitution</a> [text], which bans any action that threatens to cut the pension benefits of public employees. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said he intends to appeal the decision. The orders prevent Governor Rick Snyder and Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr from taking further actions that threaten to diminish the pension benefits of City of Detroit retirees. The ruling also requires Snyder to direct Orr to withdraw the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter9.aspx">Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy Code</a> [text] petition filed on July 18 immediately. Aquilina requested a copy of the declaratory judgment be sent to US President Barack Obama.

<p>The case arises from three separate lawsuits and a Detroit bankruptcy case. The City of Detroit, unable to pay its city pensioners, filed bankruptcy on July 18. The following day, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4208768719.PDF">designated</a> [order, PDF] US Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes to oversee Detroit's bankruptcy case. The case is the biggest bankruptcy filing in the nation's history, involving more than $18 billion in debts. The three separate lawsuits were brought by city pensioners, who have been unable to collect their benefits. Lawyers representing pensioners and two city pension funds got an emergency hearing with Aquilina in an attempt to block the bankruptcy filing. Chapter 9 protects a city against most lawsuits so the municipality can reorganize its operations and debt without distraction. Detroit's financial woes are leading to discussion of an unlikely bailout, though federal officials have not commented definitively on the matter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

County Clerk Ernest Dronenburg Jr. argues that last month's <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US Supreme Court decision on Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report] applies only to the couples named in the lawsuit and to the clerks in Alameda and Los Angeles counties, where they applied for marriage licenses. A spokesperson said the clerk's office is seeking <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/-San-Diego-County-Clerk-Asks-Court-to-Stop-Same-Sex-Marriage-216235731.html">clarification of the law</a> [NBC San Diego report]. In response to the filing, California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-issues-statement-san-diego-county-proposition-8">said</a> [press release], "The filing offers no new arguments that could deny same-sex couples their constitutionally protected civil rights. The federal injunction is still in effect, and it requires all 58 counties to perform same-sex marriages. No exceptions."

<p>Last week the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/the-supreme-court-of-california.php">rejected</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/proposition-8-supporters-ask-california-supreme-court-to-halt-same-sex-marriages.php">similar petition</a> [JURIST reports] to block same-sex marriage filed by supporters of Proposition 8. Same-sex marriages resumed in California last month after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ninth-circuit-lifts-californias-ban-on-same-sex-marriages.php">dissolved the ban</a> [JURIST report]. The move came after the US Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 8 supporters lacked standing to appeal a ruling striking down the ban as unconstitutional. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Abu Qatada was charged on July 7 with "conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts" following his deportation after Jordan's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/jordan-approves-uk-treaty-that-will-lead-to-deportation-of-abu-qatada.php">approved a treaty</a> [JURIST report] with the UK. Qatada pleaded not guilty. The court did <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23397002">not give a reason</a> [BBC report] for its rejection, though it is common for defendants to be denied bail in terrorism cases in Jordan. Qatada's lawyer said that he would be meeting with Qatada this week to decide on further action.

<p>Qatada was deported earlier this month from London's Belmarsh prison to the prison of Muwaggar in Amman, Jordan. Qatada was previously sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison for conspiring to carry out <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-qaeda">news archive</a>] linked attacks in Jordan. Qatada, previously described as "Osama Bin Laden's right hand man in Europe," was held in the UK for more than a decade since he was arrested in 2002 under the anti-terrorism act. In April the UK Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uk-appeals-court-denies-governments-abu-qatada-appeal.php">refused</a> to allow the government to appeal to the Supreme Court an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-appeal-to-deport-radical-islamist-cleric-dismissed.php">decision not to deport</a> [JURIST reports] Qatada until a fair trial treaty had been ratified, fearing Qatada would be tortured upon his return to Jordan. The UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied bail</a> last year after Qatada was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST reports] and rearrested to begin deportation proceedings. In February of 2009, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">ordered the UK</a> [JURIST report] to pay &#163;2,500 in damages to Qataba after determining that he was imprisoned by the UK in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As one of the largest providers of development assistance in the world, Lumina recommended that Japan make a "more explicit commitment to incorporating human rights principles into the design, implementation and monitoring of its international development cooperation policies." Though the <a href="http://www.jica.go.jp/english/">Japan International Cooperation Agency</a> (JICA), the <a href="http://www.nexi.go.jp/en/">Nippon Export and Investment Insurance</a> (NEXI) and the <a href="http://www.jbic.go.jp/en/">Japan Bank for International Cooperation</a> (JBIC) [official websites], have guidelines to ensure that Japan's development projects are not environmentally or socially detrimental, Lumina <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13562&LangID=E">noted</a> [mission statement] that these institutions do not effectively ensure accountability, and he encouraged the government of Japan to strengthen these guidelines by requiring a compressive human rights impact assessment. Lumina also called upon Japan to follow through on its <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45466&Cr=development%20cooperation&Cr1=#.Ue2bVVOxPFI">commitment to establish an independent National Human Rights Institution</a> [UN News Centre report].

The law was scheduled to take effect next week, but Judge Daniel Hovland's decision, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-north-dakota-abortion-law-blocked-20130722,0,7686898.story">held</a> [LAT report] that the law is inconsistent with US Supreme Court precedent, halts its enforcement:<blockquote>A woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court for forty years. The undersigned is bound to follow that precedent and uphold the law. Because the United States Supreme Court has clearly determined the dispositive issue presented in this dispute, this Court is not free to impose its own view of the law. The State of North Dakota has presented no evidence to justify the passage of this troubling law. The State has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women. The United States Supreme Court has unequivocally said that no state may deprive a woman of the choice to terminate her pregnancy at a point prior to viability. North Dakota House Bill 1456 is clearly unconstitutional under an unbroken stream of United States Supreme Court authority.</blockquote>The Center for Reproductive Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/rights-group-challenges-north-dakota-abortion-laws.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] the law on behalf of the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo after North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple signed a number of abortion bills into law last March. 

<p>North Dakota is one of many <a href="/feature/2013/07/state-abortion-restrictions.php">states</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to enact restrictive abortion laws in recently. Last week a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-dakota-judge-strikes-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] another North Dakota law placing limitations on drug-induced abortions. Earlier this month the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an abortion bill which bans abortions after 20 weeks. Also this month <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-senate-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wisconsin-governor-signs-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Ohio</a> [JURIST reports] enacted laws which place restrictions on abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/">Female genital mutilation/cutting</a> [WHO backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fgm">news archive</a>] (FGM/C) is on the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_69883.html">decline around the world</a> [press release], according to a comprehensive new <a href="https://selectra.co.uk/sites/selectra.co.uk/files/pdf/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Monday by <a href="http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58002.html">UNICEF</a> [official website]. FGM/C refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Most procedures are based in traditional social beliefs that altering the genitalia of females will preserve their honor for marriage, but in fact can cause <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606688053/abstract">serious pain and life-threatening infections</a> [WHO research study]. UNICEF cited the decline of this practice as the result of <a href="http://www.unicef.org/evaluation/index_69673.html">multiple campaigns</a> that contributed to the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/topics/genderissues/fgm">knowledge base of parents</a> [UN materials], helping them to decide whether it was necessary. For those who do decide to retain tradition, the study noted an increase of the medicalization of the process, as a new trend in data shows that more FMG/C procedures are now being performed by doctors in sterile environments, as opposed to local practitioners lacking sterile facilities.

The <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/home;jsessionid=4F3CAE8E25578F8E8E102DE266195DD8.jahia01">UN Population Fund</a> (UNFPA) [official website] and the UNICEF reported in February that <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-call-for-end-to-female-genital-mutilation.php">significant progress has been made</a> [JURIST report] in ending the practice of FGM/C but called upon the international community to do more to end the practice. The newest report indicates that as many as 125 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of FGM/C. Last November a UN panel urged countries to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">ban</a> [JURIST reports] FGM/C. In February 2012 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-reports-progress-in-ending-female-genital-mutilation.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] similar progress in ending the practice. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called on the government of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php">Iraqi Kurdistan</a> [JURIST report] to outlaw female FGM/C. <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">Uganda</a> [JURIST report] joined the movement against FGM/C in 2009 by outlawing it, although it is still practiced there.]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://kuwaithumanrights.org.kw/">Kuwait Society for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] helped break the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gWj-FQYhi_3bel_u7hZLyomuqvyw?docId=CNG.761b25710fbee1a45239ed23c8490cc0.4c1">story</a> [AFP report] internationally via Twitter, when its director posted a short statement regarding the acquittal. The three men were convicted in February of insulting <a href="http://www.da.gov.kw/eng/hhamir/hhamir.php">Emir Shaikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah</a> [official website] at a protest in October. As members of parliament, they initially spoke out against new election laws and several other issues dealing with flawed civil procedure. The same flaws they addressed later led to the dissolution of the parliament. The Kuwait government has not yet indicated if it will choose to appeal this decision to the supreme court. 

<p>Recent political unrest in the region has caused the Kuwaiti government to <a href="http://news.kuwaittimes.net/woman-jailed-11-yrs-for-anti-amir-tweets-assembly-in-semi-paralysis-as-it-awaits-ruling/">clamp down</a> [<em>Kuwait Times</em> report] on online activists, with dozens of people serving sentences or awaiting trial on charges of insulting the Emir. A criminal court in Kuwait in June sentenced a woman to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/kuwait-woman-sentenced-to-11-years-for-criticizing-regime-over-twitter.php">11 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for remarks she made on Twitter.  In April Kuwaiti opposition leader Mussallam Al Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kuwait-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-for-criticizing-regime.php">sentenced</a> to five years after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">arrested</a> [JURIST reports] last October for criticizing the Emir in a public speech. Al Barrak was released on <a href="paperchase/2013/04/kuwait-opposition-leader-accused-of-criticizing-regime-released-on-bail.php">bail</a> [JURIST report] soon after his sentencing. Al Barrak's speech was made during a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kuwait-opposition-leaders-criticize-government-challenge-to-election-law.php">boycott</a> of a controversial election law <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/kuwait-constitutional-court-upholds-controversial-election-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] last September that some believe the incumbent party can use to redistrict the country to its own advantage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ohio law prohibits same-sex marriage but recognizes marriages solemnized outside of the state. James Obergefell and his partner, John Arthur, who suffers from a terminal illness, married legally in Maryland earlier this month and returned to Ohio where they have resided for nearly 20 years. Arthur seeks to include Obergefell as his surviving spouse on his death certificate. The parties, accordingly, filed suit requesting that the court preliminarily enjoin enforcement of Ohio's same-sex marriage prohibition. The plaintiffs were required to show, among other things, a substantial likelihood that they would prevail on the merits at trial. The court granted their motion Tuesday, finding: <blockquote>In derogation of law, the Ohio scheme has unjustifiably created two tiers of couples: (1) opposite-sex married couples legally married in other states; and (2) same-sex married couples legally married in other states. This lack of equal protection of law is fatal. ... Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood that they will prevail at trial on their claim that by treating lawful same sex marriages differently than it treats lawful opposite sex marriages Ohio law, as applied here, violates the United States Constitution which guarantees that "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws."</blockquote>According to media sources, the decision is likely to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-gay-ohio-couple-seeking-recognition-of-out-of-state-marriage/2013/07/23/9c89541e-f399-11e2-81fa-8e83b3864c36_story.html">encourage</a> [AP report] same-sex couples to challenge restrictive marriage laws in other states. 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Last week the San Diego County Clerk <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/california-clerk-asks-state-high-court-to-halt-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court of California on Friday seeking to require county clerks to enforce Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban. Earlier in July three same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/arkansas-lawsuit-seeks-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Arkansas' same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs argue that Amendment 83 to the Arkansas Constitution, which reads, "Marriage consists only of the union of one man and one woman," violates their rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. Also in July, the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/the-supreme-court-of-california.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request from Proposition 8 supporters to halt same-sex marriages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ordinance requires that prospective renters provide proof of their immigration status, and allows for anyone found to be undocumented to be evicted from their rental property. The court held that the law conflicts with federal law, stating:<blockquote>We conclude that enforcement of the Ordinance conflicts with federal law. ... Conflict exists despite Farmers Branch's argument that its Ordinance establishes "concurrent enforcement" of federal immigration law, as "[t]he fact of a common end hardly neutralizes conflicting means." By setting forth criminal offenses that "discourage illegal immigration or otherwise reinforce federal immigration law," and by providing for state judicial review of a non-citizen's lawful or unlawful presence, the Ordinance creates such conflict.</blockquote>The ordinance in question has been blocked by federal courts since its inception in 2006 and has never gone into effect.  

<p>Last year, the Fifth Circuit <a href="http:"/paperchase/2012/03/court-of-appeals-upholds-ban-on-texas-city-immigrant-housing-ordinance.php">upheld the ban  on the ordinance</a> [JURIST report], finding that it served no legitimate purpose and served only to impose an extra burden on immigrants. In 2008 a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-blocks-dallas-suburb.php">temporary injunction was issued</a> [JURIST report] against the enforcement of the ordinance. In the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/farmersbranch_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dallas-suburb-faces-lawsuit-over.php">filed earlier in 2008</a> [JURIST report], several landlords and a former City Council member challenged the constitutionality of Ordinance 2952, alleging it denied immigrants equal protection and due process rights. The city <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dallas-suburb-approves-new-rental.php">passed the ordinance</a> after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-federal-court-strikes-down-law.php">previous law was struck down</a> [JURIST reports] by a US district judge in 2007 as an infringement of federal supremacy in the area of immigration. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/russias-top-lawyers-sound-alarm-government-abuse-constitution-174615467.html">letter accuses the government</a> [CSM report] of systematic rights abuses and efforts to silence political opponents and eliminate forms of legal protest:<blockquote>How can we speak about a law-governed state when we see a war being waged against the public influence of the emerging civil society in this country? ... The word "war" is no mere figure of speech in this context, because we can not help observing that almost all public institutions of power are coordinating their actions [in the assault on civil society]. This includes state institutions whose very purpose is to protect the constitutional and fundamental rights of the individual.</blockquote>The letter was sent to mark the 20th anniversary of the Russian Constitution.

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently. Earlier this month protest leader <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/russia-protest-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-embezzlement.php">Alexei Navalny</a> [JURIST report], was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement.

In May a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/russia-court-rejects-appeal-by-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by members of the feminist punk group <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] against their sentence for a protest against Putin. Earlier in May the EU <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/137151.pdf">expressed concern</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/eu-concerned-over-russia-human-rights-record.php">report</a>] with Russia's human rights record Sunday, focusing on the country's recent adoption of restrictive legislation, the prosecution of political activists and efforts towards establishing an independent judiciary. Human rights groups have criticized Russia's recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">foreign agents law</a> [JURIST report] since its adoption last November. The law requires non-governmental organizations and <a href="/dateline/2013/05/shubin-nikita-russian-law.php">non-commercial organizations</a> [JURIST op-ed] to register as foreign agents if they engage in any political activity or receive foreign funding. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW based its report on interviews with former M23 fighters who have abandoned the movement. According to the report, Rwanda is permitting the M23 rebels to recruit from within Rwanda and is giving material support to the rebels, including food, uniforms, ammunition and other supplies. While a panel of UN experts reported in June that Rwanda's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rights-group-says-rwanda-continues-to-support-congo-rebels-despite-ongoing-rights-abuses/2013/07/23/eaaff944-f386-11e2-81fa-8e83b3864c36_story.html">support for the M23 is declining</a> [AP report], HRW asserted that the support remains significant and called upon the UN and the US to urge Rwanda to halt support to the M23. 

<p>DRC and M23 forces have faced numerous accusations of war crimes and human rights violations. In May a UN report found that DRC troops <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">committed rape and murder</a> [JURIST report] as they retreated from an advance by M23 rebels last November. In February HRW reported that during the siege of Goma, M23 forces <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">summarily executed 24 individuals</a> [JURIST report], 21 of whom were civilians, and raped 36 women, including a 10-year-old girl. In November the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] M23 guerrilla attacks on the DRC and called for an immediate end to all support for the group. Last year a leaked UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">report</a> [JURIST report] revealed that Rwanda had been supporting M23 and other groups guilty of human rights violations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court did not give deference to the federal agency's policy of neither approving or reviewing shipments of sodium thiopental from <a href="http://www.dreampharma.com">Dream Pharma</a> [corporate website], a British manufacturer, because the policy was arbitrary and capricious. The court said sodium thiopental, a drug whose manufacture and purpose of use has not been regulated by the FDA, was "misbranded" and an "unapproved new drug," violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/chapter-9">Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a> (FDCA) and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5/subchapter-II">Administration Procedure Act</a> (APA) [texts]. The court concluded, "The FDA acted in derogation of [its] duties by permitting the importation of thiopental, a concededly misbranded and unapproved new drug, and by declaring that it would not in the future sample and examine foreign shipments of the drug despite knowing they may have been prepared in an unregistered establishment.

<p>Thiopental is administered first in lethal injections to induce anesthesia, but, if not given in proper dosage, the drug can cause a "substantial, constitutionally unacceptable risk" of suffocation and pain. Death row prisoners from Arizona, California and Tennessee brought suit against the FDA and Department of Health and Human Services. Sodium thiopental has not been domestically manufactured in the US for over a decade. The shortage of sodium thiopental in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol, which has led to a number of constitutional challenges by death row inmates. In August 2011 an Arkansas judge ruled that the state law provision allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arkansas-judge-rules-part-of-execution-law-unconstitutional.php">violated the protection against cruel and unusual punishment</a> [JURIST report]. The Arkansas Department of Correction came under fire for purchasing thiopental from overseas. In March 2011 two Texas inmates <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [USA Today report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the court ruled that the plaintiffs have an implied right of action to seek injunctive relief from the act on federal preemption grounds. The court also ruled that plaintiffs need not wait to be arrested under the challenged sections of the act before they can assert a constitutional claim, stating that "they need not live under a cloud of 'prolonged uncertainty' as to their rights." Ruling on the merits, the court decided that the presumption against preemption does not apply here because immigration is an area traditionally regulated by the federal government. Moreover, the broad sweep of the law violates the clear rule of <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Arizona_v_United_States_No_11182_2012_BL_157302_US_June_25_2012_C">Arizona v. United States</a> [opinion] that unlawful presence is not a criminal offense. The court also stated that the state of South Carolina is preempted by the federal government in the areas of regulating the concealing, harboring and transporting of unlawfully present aliens and regulating the field of alien registration. The portions of the law blocked by this decision made it a state criminal offense for: a person unlawfully present in the US to conceal, harbor, or shelter herself from detection, or allow herself to be transported within the state; a third party to participate in concealing, sheltering, or transporting a person unlawfully present in the US; an alien 18 years or older to fail to carry an alien registration card; and an individual to display or possess a false identification card for the purpose of proving lawful presence. The preliminary injunction was upheld, as plaintiffs made a clear showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge and that they will likely suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted.

<p>The lawsuit against the South Carolina immigration law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-halts-south-carolina-immigration-lawsuit.php">put on hold</a> [JURIST report] in January 2012 pending the outcome of <span class="casename">Arizona</span>, which was decided on June 25 of that year. A number of <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">states have enacted immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in addition to South Carolina, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports], modeling their recent immigration laws after Arizona's controversial SB 1070. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-dismisses-georgia-immigration-law-challenge.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit seeking to scrap a key part of Georgia's sweeping anti-illegal immigration law. In April the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-denies-alabama-immigration-appeal-takes-drug-death-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] <em>certiorari</em> in an appeal over Alabama's immigration law. In March a judge for the <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-indiana-immigration-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that portions of the Indiana immigration law are unconstitutional. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">Arizona</span>, lower courts have handed down a variety of rulings. In September 2012 a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-upholds-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial provision of Arizona's immigration law that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Alabama's controversial <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 56, PDF], upheld a few sections of the law and rejected part of Georgia's <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/20112012/116631.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 87, text]. That same month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perry</a> [opinion, PDF]. The decision was issued without comment in a single sentence, stating, "The request for an immediate temporary stay or injunctive relief is denied." County clerk Ernest Dronenburg Jr. <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/california-clerk-asks-state-high-court-to-halt-same-sex-marriages.php">sought the stay</a> [JURIST report] on Friday, asking the court to consider his legal argument that same-sex marriages still are illegal in most of California. Dronenburg Jr. argues that the US Supreme Court decision on Proposition 8 applies only to the couples named in the lawsuit and to the clerks in Alameda and Los Angeles counties, where they applied for marriage licenses. Following the US Supreme Court's decision regarding <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], clerks throughout the state must issue licenses to same-sex couples. Dronenburg is in charge of issuing marriage licenses in San Diego County.

Same-sex marriages resumed in California last month after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ninth-circuit-lifts-californias-ban-on-same-sex-marriages.php">dissolved the ban</a> [JURIST report]. The move came after the US Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 8 supporters lacked standing to appeal a ruling striking down the ban as unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Alekhina filed the appeal after a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot-denied-parole.php">denied her parole</a> [JURIST report] in May. Alekhina and her fellow band mates, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevic, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison for "hooliganism" following the band's February 2012  performance of a protest song titled "Mother of God drive Putin away." The song was performed at a sacred Russian Orthodox Church, Christ the Savior Cathedral, in Moscow and the court held that the performance was driven by religious hatred. While Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">released on probation</a> [JURIST report] in October of 2012 because police removed her from the Cathedral before she could actually participate in the performance, Tolokonnikova was also denied parole in May. The court will hear <a href="http://rt.com/politics/pussy-riot-appeal-rejected-522/">Tolokonnikova's appeal</a> [RT report] on Friday. 

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot has generated significant international attention. On Monday Amnesty International published a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pussy_riot_open_letter_22-07-13.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] signed by more than 100 musicians, including U2, Adele, Paul McCartney and Madonna, calling for the release of the remaining members of Pussy Riot. In February, the band filed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/russia-feminist-rock-group-appeals-conviction-to-europe-rights-court.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] challenging their conviction. In January a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-feminist-rock-group-appeal-of-internet-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the band's appeal of an Internet ban on the group's videos. In October Alekhina and Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to separate regional prisons, both of which are generally reserved for dangerous criminals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rhodes asserted that his court has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/24/us-usa-detroit-idUSBRE96N05Z20130724">exclusive jurisdiction</a> [Reuters report] over the <a href="http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/">case</a> [materials]. While Wednesday's decision did not determine whether Detroit will ultimately receive Chapter 9 protection, it allows the case to proceed on the merits and gives Rhodes the ability to determine <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/judge-clears-path-for-detroit-bankruptcy-case.html?_r=0">issues raised by retired public employees</a> [NYT report] with respect to their pensions.

<p>Detroit's bankruptcy is the largest bankruptcy filing in the nation's history and the first time a municipality has filed. The filing prompted numerous lawsuits challenging the bankruptcy under the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/historical/miconstitution1850.htm">Michigan Constitution</a> [text], which bans any action that threatens to cut the benefits of public employees. On Friday, a judge for Michigan's Ignham County Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/michigan-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the bankruptcy is unconstitutional and must be withdrawn, which prevented Governor Rick Snyder and Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr from taking further action regarding the bankruptcy. Wednesday's decision supersedes the state court ruling. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/bills/hb57.htm">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text], <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-governor-signs-bill-strengthening-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in April, requires abortion clinics to meet unprecedented medical standards that supporters argue will protect women from unsanitary conditions. These standards require service providers to have admitting privileges to nearby hospitals and facilities to meet health codes for ambulatory surgical centers. Because every hospital has separate requirements for admission privileges, and some clinics are not close enough to hospitals to qualify, many will be forced to shut down because it is not possible to comply. For those that are close enough to qualify, they face deep financial challenges in upgrading to meet health codes that many view as medically unnecessary for abortion procedures. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama and Planned Parenthood  have <a href="http://www.aclualabama.org/News/PressReleases/WomensRights/131106.html">initiated litigation</a> [press release] to challenge the constitutionality of the law, which they argue is not about standards of health care, but rather a political strategy to bring about the de facto end to widely available procedures. Judge Myron Thompson's ruling <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/politics/alabama-abortion-law/index.html">puts the law on hold</a> [CNN report] pending the outcome of the litigation.

<p>Alabama is <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">one of many states</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to enact restrictive abortion laws in recently. JURIST Guest Columnist LaJuana Davis recently <a href="/forum/2013/05/lajuana-davis-alabama-abortion.php">called such measures</a> [JURIST op-ed] "back-door restrictions" on abortion. Last week a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-dakota-judge-strikes-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a North Dakota law placing limitations on drug-induced abortions. Earlier this month the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an abortion bill which bans abortions after 20 weeks.

Section 214(d) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ228/pdf/PLAW-107publ228.pdf">Foreign Relations Authorization Act</a> [text, PDF] requires the State Department to list Jerusalem, Israel, as the birthplace for US citizens born in Jerusalem if the parents request, but the law has been challenged ever since. The appeals court found that &#167; 214 is unconstitutional, basing its decision on the executive power of recognition, affirming that only the executive has the sole power to recognize a state. This decision now requires that section of the law to be reinterpreted, as congress does not have the power to recognize foreign states. The office of the president has never recognized any one state as having jurisdiction over the city of Jerusalem, and as such, citizens born there cannot include a country name on their passport. 

<p>Citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=passport+Jerusalem">Menachem Zivotofsky</a> [JURIST news archive] was born in Jerusalem in 2002. His parents asked the State Department to record his place of birth as Jerusalem, Israel, but were told it could only be listed as Jerusalem because the US does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. His parents filed suit in 2003 based on the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which allowed listing of Israel. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit as a political question. In March 2012 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-listing-of-israel-on-birth-certificate-is-not-a-political-question.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that this challenge was not a political question and thus the federal courts do have jurisdiction over the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, however, did find that various aspects of the court proceedings violated articles of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Among other things, the court <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-4445686-5349935">cited</a> [press release] a violation of the sections of Article 5 dealing with a right to liberty and security, due to the length of Lebedev's detention on remand. The court also found a violation of Article 8 and the right to respect for private and family life, due to the transfer of Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev to penal colonies in Siberia and the Far North. The court stated that it was "prepared to admit that some government officials had their own reasons to push for the applicants' prosecution. However, it was insufficient to conclude that the applicants would not have been convicted otherwise." Lawyers for Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev argued that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10202131/Mikhail-Khodorkovsky-trial-was-unfair-but-not-political-rules-European-court.html">Russia should immediately quash the convictions</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] and release the men from prison.  

<p>Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are each serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering. In 2010 former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] testified that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin&page=2">news archive</a>] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Khodorkovsky for political reasons. Kasyanov stated that Putin indicated that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without approval from the president, prompting his arrest. In December the <a href="http://www.anticorruption.bg/ombudsman/eng/readnews.php?id=6081&lang=en&t_style=tex&l_style=default">Human Rights Ombudsman</a> [backgrounder] in Russia, <a href="http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/People/Luk/lukin1.html">Vladimir Lukin</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russian-human-rights-official-appeals-ruling-against-khodorkovsky.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in a Moscow court following the ruling against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, because the two men were ordered to pay restitution for the same losses twice, once in 2005 and once in 2010. In the same month, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-court-reduces-khodorkovsky-sentence.php">had their sentences commuted</a> [JURIST report] by the Moscow City Court from 13 years to 11 years, making both men eligible for release in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay called upon Tunisian authorities to investigate the assassination and bring those responsible to justice. She also urged Tunisian authorities to better protect those like Brahmi who may be at risk of assassination, as such killings threaten to undermine Tunisia's efforts to formulate a new constitution. The assassination of Brahmi marks the second time in the past year that an opposition party leader has been killed in Tunisia, with <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-killing-of-tunisia-political-oposition-leader.php">Chokri Belaid being assassinated</a> [JURIST report] in February.

Bo allegedly used his position in the Communist Party of China (CPC) to accept bribes in the form of property and money for himself and others. Bo's case is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-prepares-ground-for-bo-xilais-trial-of-century/2013/07/24/773972c6-f45b-11e2-aa2e-4088616498b4_story.html">viewed as a challenge</a> [WP report] for China's new president Xi Jinping, who faced pressure from within the CPC not to punish Bo harshly and to avoid a public trial. Though Xinhua stated that Bo's arrest is an example of China's "strong determination" to end corruption, Chinese authorities have continued to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-authorities-detain-anti-corruption-activist-xu-zhiyong.php">detain</a> [JURIST report] anti-corruption activist Xu Zhiyong for "assembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place."

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform its judicial system and combat corruption. In March the chief justice of China's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-chief-judge-urges-courts-to-continue-legal-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the country to continue to implement legal reform to combat corruption and foster social and economic growth. In December 2010 a former Chinese corruption official was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-official-executed.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] for accepting more than USD $4.7 million in bribes. In July of that same year, China <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] its top judicial official for accepting bribes, protecting criminal gangs and rape. In March 2010 a life sentence for former vice president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) for bribery and embezzlement was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month, SPC president called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">increased efforts to fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in China's court system. In January 2010 the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">announced a set of new ant-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an efforts to increase public confidence in the rule of law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If the bill is passed, the court will be presided over by judges that are nominated by the president and confirmed by congress. Additionally, it would require implementation of an adversarial system and the eventual declassification of its records. The court currently only hears <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">confidential matters</a> [public filings page] in an <em>ex parte</em> format without the direct oversight of any executive branch agency. Schiff said:<blockquote>This move would likely result in a more diverse set of judges on the Court, and strengthen the checks and balances that Congress intended to create when the FISC was established. In light of the significance of the FISA Court opinions, their classified nature and their virtual unreviewability, the American people&#8212;through the Senate&#8212;should have the opportunity to probe nominees on their Fourth Amendment views and other key matters.</blockquote>This bill calls for the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/nominations/112thCongressExecutiveNominations/PrivacyAndCivilLibertiesOversightBoard.cfm">Federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board</a>, a subcommittee of the <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/">Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official websites], to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to implement the adversarial process, essentially granting congress the power to decide what is and is not kept confidential.

<p>Revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism.php">US government surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked debate and controversy since the leak of confidential documents in June by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last week the FISC permitted Yahoo to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/yahoo-allowed-to-disclose-nsa-data-requests-fisc.php">declassify a redacted 2008 order</a> [JURIST report] that the company comply with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in data collection. This past month <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">civil liberties groups</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">Google, and Microsoft</a> [JURIST reports] have directly challenged the court to declassify data collected under its orders. Other parties filed <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">motions in federal court</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Supreme Court </a> [JURIST reports] challenging the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance program that benefited from the FISC's oversight. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order, prompting legislators to urge for greater oversight in the FISC. The US government has <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former government contractor Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/shelby-county-v-holder/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Shelby County v. Holder</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that section 4 of the VRA was unconstitutional, and its formula could no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. Section 4 provided the formula for determining which jurisdictions were subject to Section 5. Holder explained:<blockquote>The evidence of intentional racial discrimination that was presented last year in the redistricting case, Texas v. Holder&#8212;as well as the history of pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities that the Supreme Court itself has recognized&#8212;we believe that the State of Texas should be required to go through a preclearance process whenever it changes its voting laws and practices.</blockquote>Holder stated that this was not to be the DOJ's last action to protect voting rights following the Shelby County decision, but emphasized that filing federal lawsuits to subject jurisdictions to Section 5 was no substitute for the legislation which must "fill the void" left by the Supreme Court's decision. 

<p>Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling, Section 5 of the VRA was the source of renewed controversy, as lawsuits in jurisdictions including <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-court-rules-texas-voting-map-discriminatory.php">Texas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/alaska-files-lawsuit-challenging-voting-rights-act.php">Alaska</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-south-carolina-voter-id-law.php">South Carolina</a> sought to invalidate the preclearance enforcement scheme to which they were subject. Congress voted in 2006 to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/bush-signs-bill-extending-voting.php">extend the VRA</a> [JURIST report] for another 25 years, despite <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/house-gop-leaders-put-off-voting.php">attempts</a> [JURIST report] by some lawmakers to amend or repeal the Act based on concerns over excessive federal oversight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although Cohen was not charged in the indictment, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/ia-3634.pdf">civil action</a> [text, PDF] against Cohen last week accusing him of failing to supervise his employees, alleging that he "fostered a culture that focused on not discussing inside information too openly, rather than not seeking or trading on such information in the first place."

The country has been plagued by an internal war with these rebel groups for the past five decades, and the president defended the amendment as the best chance for peace. Rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.coljuristas.org/">Colombian Commission of Jurists</a> (CCJ) [advocacy website], challenged the amendment because it vests the parliament with the discretion to decide which acts of war are applicable to the justice system. According to the CCJ and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], this discretion could <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/31/colombia-amend-legal-framework-peace-bill">lead to loopholes</a> [HRW report] that allow violent criminals to escape justice. Santos defended the amendment as a vital prerequisite for peace, "Our commitment to the expectations and rights of the victims is serious," Santos said. "It's not about sacrificing justice to reach peace but how to achieve peace with the most justice." The representative for the CCJ responded, "In this case the cure could end up being worse than the disease," The Constitutional Court's decision has not yet been released.

<p>The <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/">Colombian Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/14164-el-proximo-martes-se-conciliara-marco-juridico-de-paz">approved</a> [press release] the new law by a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/colombia-approves-law-for-peace-talks-with-armed-forces.php">vote of 63-3</a> [JURIST report] last year. In December the representative to Colombia for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] Christian Salazar, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-representative-calls-for-peace-in-colombia.php">called for a peaceful solution</a> [JURIST report] to the country's ongoing violence. In June of last year, Santos <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/colombia-president-signs-victims-compensation-law.php">signed</a> legislation to compensate victims of the country's armed conflict after the country's senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/colombia-senate-passes-victim-compensation-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] it a month earlier. International entities were also involved in the country's violence.

Halliburton stands accused of destroying the results of an internal investigation into the well's construction to determine what caused the accident. As part of the plea agreement, Halliburton has agreed to admit its criminal conduct, pay a fine and be subject to three years of probation. Halliburton has also agreed to cooperate with the government's ongoing criminal investigation.

<p>In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between <a href="http://www.bp.com/">BP</a> [corporate website] and the DOJ for the company's criminal liability in the spill.

The legislation was approved by the state house by a vote of 73-41 after the senate approved it by a vote of 33-14. The vote was split mainly along party lines, with Republicans arguing that the measures are necessary to prevent fraud and Democrats arguing that the legislation will have the effect of disenfranchising many voters. In addition to the photo ID requirement, the bill would also shorten the early voting period from 17 days to 10 and end same-day voter registration. The measure is expected to be signed into law by <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website].

<p>North Carolina becomes the first state to enact voter restrictions since the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] last month. Section 5 of the VRA requires jurisdictions with a history of preventing minority groups from voting to receive preclearance from the US Department of Justice or a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia before making any changes to their voting laws. Section 4 provided a formula for determining which jurisdictions are covered under section 5. North Carolina had been subject to section 5 preclearance requirements. More than 30 US states have passed some kind of <a href="/feature/2013/07/voter-id-laws.php">voter ID laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder], including 17 others that require photo ID.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Known as "<a href="https://www.unfe.org/">Free and Equal</a>," [official website] the campaign focuses on public education as a means of countering intolerance and violence towards the millions of LGBT people worldwide. Through the work of social media, a new website, a series of fact sheets, and celebrity endorsements, the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/07/26/human-rights-office-gay-rights/2589411/">campaign will use education</a> [AP report], according to UN spokesman Charles Radcliffe, as a "weapon against prejudice." While 85 UN member states signed a statement in 2011 expressing concern for human rights violations perpetrated against LGBT people, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45503&Cr=lesbian&Cr1=#.UfP3EGT71cR">more than one-third of the world's countries</a> [press release] have codified consensual, same-sex conduct as a criminal offense. 

<p>As debate continues, the UN has remained active in its pursuit for equal rights. Last November the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-passes-resolution-condemning-execution-for-lgbt-status.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution condemning extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions based on "gender identity." In July UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-sexual-orientation-discrimination.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] human rights activists for their work to protect LGBT rights while calling for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and stressing that violence and discrimination against the LGBT community is a human rights violation. In step with the UN, Human Rights Watch in June <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-calls-on-bulgaria-to-denounce-anti-gay-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Bulgarian Justice Minister Diana Kovacheva to denounce calls to violence by anti-gay groups in anticipation of a LGBT pride parade in Sofia, Bulgaria. During the same month, Ugandan Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-official-government-not-discriminating-based-on-sexual-orientation.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the government was not discriminating based on sexual orientation. The statement came days after the government had <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-government-banning-organizations-for-promoting-gay-rights.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would ban at least 38 non-governmental organizations that are accused of recruiting children to homosexuality. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Egyptian military deposed Morsi earlier his month amid protests and demonstrations calling for his resignation for his alleged failure to address economic and security issues during his one-year tenure as president. Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago.

The CNRP claimed in its <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/cambodian-opposition-says/758752.html">email</a> [AFP report] that names disappeared from the electoral roll and that some voters were unable to vote because someone had previously used their ballot before they attempted to vote. The CNRP also claimed that suspicions were raised because the ink used for ballots was easily washed off. The long-standing Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won the election, taking 68 of 123 parliamentary seats. The CPP has yet to comment on its victory or respond to the CNRP's allegations.

<p>The Cambodian government has recently come under criticism for its abuse of its political powers. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on Cambodia's donors to oppose a land titling campaign, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-cambodia-land-redistribution-campaign-open-to-corruption.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] that it lacks accountability and transparency and is prone to abuse. Last year, Dr. Mark Ellis, executive director of the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/">International Bar Association</a> (IBA) [official website], published the second in a series of reports examining the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] and <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/credibility-of-cambodia-genocide-tribunal-questioned.php">asserting</a> [JURIST report] that the legitimacy of the ECCC has been undermined and that a criticism of the court's failure to meet international standards must be undertaken to ensure justice. Earlier that year the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/un-rights-chief-says-ngo-restrictions-undermine-human-rights.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that recent restrictions on non-governmental organizations in the country may fundamentally affect freedoms and human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which is set to take effect in July of next year, will allow anyone with a valid driver's license or state identification card to register to vote online. It is an attempt to reduce processing times, save money and appeal to younger voters who are more tech savvy and used to doing everything online. The bill also includes security <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-27/news/chi-quinn-to-sign-bill-allowing-online-voter-registration-in-illinois-20130726_1_online-voter-registration-voter-turnout-quinn-signs-bill">measures to prevent fraudulent registration</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report], including requiring each online registrant to enter the date his or her identification card was issued as well as the last four digits of his or her social security number. Supporters of the bill hope that the ease of registering will increase the number of voters and plan to have the system up and running before the March primary election. 

<p>Voter registration and prevention of voter fraud has been a controversial issue in recent years. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-arizona-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona law that required proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.

Earlier that month the Texas attorney general also <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/texas-ag-appeals-block-of-voter-registration-law.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling from a district court that struck down its law that would have only allowed deputy registrars to register voters in their own counties. Michigan's governor <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/michigan-governor-vetoes-voter-identification-law.php">vetoed a law</a> [JURIST report] in July of last year that would have required voters to confirm their citizenship before voting and would have required voter registration groups to undergo specified training.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of Egypt's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] and former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] refused to clear the streets on Sunday despite mass killings by Egyptian security forces.

Members of the Brotherhood claim that the military is committing violent massacres in an attempt to return to the era of the corrupt, murderous security and intelligence state. The country's Interior Ministry, however has denied reports that police opened fire on the crowds and a prosecutor has launched an investigation into the incidents. These increased tensions come just weeks after Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-order-arrest-of-muslim-brotherhood-leader.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohammed Badie. 

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked this month in the wake of new developments. The country's Interior Minister announced on Saturday that supporters of Morsi would be dispersed "as soon as possible." That same day, the UN urged the Egyptian government to ensure the application of law and order and to promote safety and security in dealing with protesters. The country's interim government also caused controversy earlier this month when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down</a> [JURIST report] four Islamist-run television stations that it viewed as sympathetic to Morsi and his supporters.

The <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-approves-referendum-bill-on-peace/">bill</a> [Times of Israel report] would exist as Basic Law in the country, which preserves basic rights and presides over other laws. Although a similar measure was passed in 2010, it was not a Basic Law and thus did not possess the same weight as the present bill would. A paper from a cabinet briefing expressed the government's intention to prioritize passage of the bill because of its importance and urgency. It is expected to go before the <a href="http://knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Knesset</a> [official website] on Wednesday for a first reading and that it will be voted on by next week.

<p>Conflicts between Israel and Palestine have repeatedly raised concerns of possible human rights violations. In March a UN rights experts called for Israel to cease all settlement activity and immediately <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-withdraw-settlers-from-palestinian-territories.php">withdraw settlers</a> [JURIST report] from Palestinian territories due to the possibility of human rights abuses. The UN in December called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">implement and support</a> [JURIST report] the conflict-ending cease fire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. Months earlier, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] had urged Israel to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] the alleged mistreatment of two Palestinian prisoners currently on hunger strike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His announcement, however, came with concerns over ongoing arrests of activists. On Tuesday, Myanmar President Thein Sein <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/130723/myanmar-grants-amnesty-73-political-prisoners">granted amnesty</a> [<em>Kyodo</em> report] to the 73 prisoners on "humanitarian grounds." Following the release, it is estimated that fewer than 100 political prisoners remain in the country. Quintana stated his belief, however, that political arrests continue, which he vowed to continue investigating.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's sectarian violence and human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] demanded that the government of Myanmar do more to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-chief-urges-myanmar-to-combat-ethnic-and-religious-discrimination.php">combat religious and ethnic discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against minorities or risk undermining the reform movement in the country. In May Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-for-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">welcomed recommendations</a> [JURIST report] by the Myanmar government's Rakhine Investigation Commission but at the same time also voicing a strong need for the government to address impunity and ensure investigations into credible allegations of systematic human rights violations against Muslims in Rakhine state. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] demanded that the Myanmar government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/myanmar-government-urged-to-provide-justice-for-attacks-on-muslim-community.php">investigate and hold accountable</a> [JURIST report] those involved in the deadly violence in the Mandalay Region in March, in which an estimated 40 people were killed and 61 more were wounded. Also in April Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">expressed serious concerns</a> [JURIST report] in a report on growing violence between Muslim and Buddhist communities in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that government inaction has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country. Quintana was appointed by the UN Human Rights Council to the position of Special Rapporteur in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its report, China Labor Watch reported at least 86 labor rights violations while investigating three Pegatron factories from March to July. Most of the workers are working 66 to 69 hours a week, which far exceeds China's statutory limit of 49 hours. The group also reported that Pegatron engaged in discriminatory hiring practices, including refusing to hire applicants older than 35 or members of ethnic minorities. The group also reported that employees were required to dump hazardous water in sewers. In a company statement, Apple said that it was "committed to providing safe and fair working conditions" and would investigate the claims about Pegatron.

<p>Conditions in Chinese factories that produce iPhones and other popular Apple products have been under continued scrutiny. In 2012 China Labor Watch accused another Taiwanese supplier, Foxconn of <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/apple-suppliers-violating-china-labor-laws-report.php">violating labor and environmental laws</a> [JURIST report] in its factories. Apple became the first technology company to join the Washington-based <a href="http://www.fairlabor.org">Fair Labor Association</a> (FLA) [official website] last year after criticism by human-rights organizations about conditions at its suppliers. As a participating company, Apple <a href="http://www.fairlabor.org/blog/entry/apple-joins-fla">agrees to uphold</a> [press release] the FLA <a href="http://www.fairlabor.org/labor-standards">Workplace Code of Conduct</a> throughout their supply chains and commit to the FLA's Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing. In 2011 the FLA worked with Apple to assess the impact of Apple's training programs which help raise awareness of labor rights and standards among workers in its supply chain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130727/colombian-judge-orders-notary-perform-same-sex-marriage">decision</a> [AFP report], Judge Campo Elias Cordoba stated that marriage was the only contractual option that would give the plaintiffs their intended outcome. The couple will be married on Monday, following the notary's statement that he will abide by the ruling. The first legally recognized same-sex marriage in Colombia took place last week after a judge in Bogota <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/07/24/world/americas/ap-lt-colombia-gay-civil-union.html?ref=samesexmarriage&_r=0">ruled</a> [AP report] that a same-sex couple was "legally joined," with all the resulting rights.

<p>In 2011 the <a href="http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/">Constitutional Court of Colombia</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf">ruled</a> [press release] unanimously that same-sex couples are "families" under the law and their relationships cannot be invalidated nor can same-sex marriage be made illegal, but gave the Colombian Congress two years to legislate same-sex marriage rather than declaring it outright constitutional. The bill, however, failed to pass in the Senate. In 2008 the court held that same-sex couples should be given the same <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/colombia-high-court-extends-pension-and.php">pension and health benefits</a> [JURIST report] as those held by opposite-sex couples. In its <a href="http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf">decision</a> [press release], the court said that to exclude same-sex couples from receiving such benefits would undermine their fundamental right to human dignity and equal protection of the laws. The previous year the Colombian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/colombia-senate-blocks-gay-rights-bill.php">voted against landmark legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have given same-sex couples who have cohabited for over a period of two years similar rights as persons in heterosexual common law marriages. Earlier, the court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/colombia-court-legalizes-same-sex.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples must be accorded the same property rights as other unmarried couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania company with 950 employees, maintains a policy not to support "anything that terminates a fertilized embryo."  The company objected to the provision of the mandate requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage to employees, including the "morning-after pill," known as <a href="http://www.planbonestep.com">Plan-B Onestep</a> [product website]. The court noted that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">backgrounder</a>] right to exercise a religious belief&#8212;under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause</a>&#8212;is a "personal right" that exists for the benefit of human beings, not artificial "persons" like corporations:<blockquote>We do not see how a for-profit, "artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law," that was created to make money could exercise such an inherently "human" right. ... It is one thing for a religious organization to be able to exercise the tenets of its faith ... and another thing for a purely secular corporation to make the same claim.</blockquote>The three-judge panel noted that the judges could not find a single court opinion, before the lawsuits against the contraception mandate began, that had found that a profit-making corporation doing ordinary business had its own right of "free exercise" of religion. 

<p>The 2-1 decision by the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">conflicts with a recent ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], which held that for-profit company <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com">Hobby Lobby</a> [corporate website] is entitled to bring claims under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text]. Under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>], private employers with more than 50 employees must provide health insurance that covers a range of birth control and reproductive health screening. Failure to do so can lead to financial penalties of up to $100 a day for each employee who is not provided with such coverage. Some 60 lawsuits are pending around the country, by profit-making businesses and various non-profit institutions, challenging this mandate on religious grounds. In his dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Kent Jordan argued that "the government takes us down a rabbit hole where religious rights are determined by the tax code, with non-profit corporations able to express religious sentiments while for-profit corporations and their owners are told that business is business and faith is irrelevant." The decision, which created a direct split among federal appeals courts enhanced chances that the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] will take on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new laws also ban any demonstrations in the nation's capital, Manama. The laws were passed ahead of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/29/world/meast/bahrain-protests">massive protests</a> [CNN report] planned by the anti-government opposition bloc next month. Bahrain's <a href="http://www.nihr.org.bh/">National Institution for Human Rights</a> (NIHR) [advocacy website, in Arabic] <a href="http://www.nihr.org.bh/media/pdf/28_July_2013.pdf">praised</a> [press release, in Arabic] the new laws as an effort to halt the "dangerous escalation" of unrest and political tensions. 

<p>Bahrain has faced civil unrest as Shiite-led protesters seek political empowerment in the Sunni-ruled country.

Anaya's call comes in response to allegations by indigenous peoples regarding the presence of private settlers, farmers, tourists, miners, illegal loggers and other third parties. Anaya urged the Panamanian government to cooperate with indigenous authorities to control and stop these invasions on indigenous land, including territories whose official recognition and demarcation is still pending.

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing issue in recent years. In February 2012 Anaya urged the Panamanian government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-expert-urges-panama-to-end-clashes-with-indigenous-peoples.php">open a dialogue</a> [JURIST report] with its indigenous people in an effort to alleviate tension and reduce violence. In December 2010 US President Barack Obama announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">US will support</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People</a> [text]. The declaration, <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/un-adopts-treaty-supporting-rights-of.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, is a non-binding treaty outlining the global human rights of approximately 370 million indigenous people and banning discrimination against them. The US was one of four member states that originally opposed adopting the treaty, citing concerns that its text conflicted with their countries' own laws, among other contentions. The US is the last member state of those in opposition to sign the declaration. In August 2010 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on governments to work to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the human rights conditions</a> [JURIST report] of the world's indigenous peoples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This case, brought by Abu Zubaydah, is the second case in which a detainee has brought charges against a third party country. The first was brought by Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, and the two cases will be heard together. Both men were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5322694.stm">top al-Qaeda suspects</a> [BBC profiles] and are currently detained at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Zubaydah is represented by <a href="http://www.interights.org/home/index.html">Interights</a> [advocacy website], a European-based human rights group which <a href="http://www.interights.org/document/270/index.html">said</a> [press release] that Poland "needs to begin to engage with the detailed allegations against it and to account for its central role in the rendition program." Poland has not released a formal statement on the matter, but did indicate that it will comply with all court procedures. 

<p>Lawyers for Zubaydah <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/guantanamo-detainee-seeks-echr-to-ruling-on-poland-role-in-cia-secret-prison.php">asked the court</a> [JURIST report] in January to rule on whether Poland violated their client's rights by aiding the US in detaining and allegedly torturing Zubaydah in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=secret+prison">secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST news archive]. Zubaydah alleges that he was transferred to Poland and subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. An <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/guantanamo-detainee-asks-poland-to-probe-alleged-cia-secret-prison.php">investigation into the prison has been ongoing</a> [JURIST report] in Poland since 2008, but Zubaydah's lawyers argued that it has made no noticeable effort to bring any perpetrators to justice. Furthermore, the case brought by the accused <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uss+cole">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] bomber Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri alleges that he has been tortured in a secret CIA prison in Poland. In August the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/open-society-justice-initiative">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI)  [advocacy website] urged the ECHR to review allegations that Romania was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/echr-urged-to-review-claims-of-cia-secret-prison-in-romania-open-society.php">involved</a> [JURIST report] in the torture and other ill-treatment of al-Nashiri as well.

According to the extensive reports filed by the Commission of Inquiry, more than 100,00 fatalities have occurred in the past two years, and there is no accountability for perpetrators on either side of the conflict. Pinheiro shifted the burden of peace from internal Syrian forces onto the international community:<blockquote>As the conflict drags on, you&#8212;and the world&#8212;have become accustomed to levels of violence that were previously unthinkable. The absence of decisive action, by the community of States as a whole, has nourished the culture of impunity that has developed inside Syria today.This war is a chronicle of missed opportunities on the part of influential States and the international community</blockquote>The General Assembly has not yet adopted a response to Pinheiro's call for action.

<p>The Commission released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-council-condemns-foreign-military-involvement-in-syria.php">report</a> [JURIST report] last month on the status of human rights in Syria and condemned foreign militants' participation in the conflict.

Raif Badawi was <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/07/30/saudi-activist-sentence-idINDEE96T0AZ20130730">found guilty</a> [Reuters report] by a Saudi court of "founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought." Badawi was originally charged with insulting Islam for co-founding the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals. He was detained in June 2012, and his case was referred to the Public Court of Jeddah in December with a recommendation to try him for the crime of apostasy. Shariah-based Saudi law is not codified and judges do not follow a system of precedent, however, apostasy is a capital offense, which can be punishable by death. In January, however, the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/31/saudi-arabia-sweeping-injustices">court decided</a> [HRW report] not to try Badawi for apostasy. The website Free Saudi Liberals was founded in 2008 and included articles that were critical of senior religious figures, and has since been removed.

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against opposition leaders as well as human rights activists. In June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-saudi-arabia-should-be-condemned-for-convicting-7-facebook-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the EU's High Representative and other EU member states' representatives to condemn Saudi Arabia for recently convicting seven governmental critics of inciting protests through Facebook. Last December HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia to dismiss the criminal case against Raif Badawi. Earlier, in August, several international human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] seeking to observe the trials of four rights activists who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government. Last July HRW first <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/16/saudi-arabia-free-editor-held-under-cybercrime-law">urged Saudi authorities</a> [HRW report] to release Badawi after he was initially charged with infringing on religious values under the Saudi 2007 Anti-Cybercrime law. HRW has also revealed that the number of capital punishment cases in the country has nearly tripled since 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sarah Ellyn Farley and Jennifer Tobits were married in 2006 and soon thereafter Farley was diagnosed with cancer. After her death in 2010, both Tobits and Farley's parents filed claims on her death benefits with her employer, <a href="http://www.cozen.com/people"> Cozen O'Connor PC</a> [firm website] under the firm's profit-sharing plan. Cozen O'Connor filed an <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/EE-PA-0243-0001.pdf">action</a> [text, PDF] in January 2011 to determine whether Tobits or Farley's parents should receive the benefits. District Judge C. Darnell Jones II relied on the recent US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">United States v. Windsor</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that denied federal recognition to legally married same-sex couples. The court reasoned that:<blockquote>Following the Court's ruling, the term spouse is no longer unconstitutionally restricted to members of the opposite sex, but now rightfully includes those same-sex spouses in "otherwise valid marriages." There can be no doubt that [Tobits] is Ms. Farley's "surviving spouse" under the plan in light of the Supreme Court's decision.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a> (NCLR) [advocacy website] Legal Director Shannon Minter, who is representing Tobits, <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageNavigator/Press_Releases_2013/Federal_Court_Rules_That_Widow_Is_Entitled_to_Survivor_Benefits.html">said</a> [press release], "[t]oday's decision is not only a victory for Jennifer and Ellyn, it is a victory for every married same-sex couple in the country. No longer can employers hide behind DOMA to deny equal benefits to some employees solely because their spouse is a person of the same sex."

<p>Since the DOMA ruling in June, courts across the country have been citing the decision. In Michigan a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-blocks-michigans-ban-on-domestic-partner-benefits.php">blocked the state's ban</a> [JURIST report] on domestic partner benefits for employees who work for public schools or local governments. Last week a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of two men seeking recognition of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. Ohio law prohibits same-sex marriage but recognizes marriages solemnized outside of the state. James Obergefell and his partner, John Arthur, who suffers from a terminal illness, married legally in Maryland earlier this month and returned to Ohio where they have resided for nearly 20 years. Arthur sought to include Obergefell as his surviving spouse on his death certificate. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law requires abortion clinics to meet requirements similar to those for outpatient surgical centers. It also requires doctors to be present during abortions, bans the procedure based on gender and bars coverage by government provided insurance plans. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Senate/Senate.html">North Carolina Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H695v4.pdf">House Bill 695</a> [text, PDF] earlier this month, despite criticism from pro-choice activists who denounced the bill as an unjust intrusion on women's reproductive rights. Regarding the new law, McCrory <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130729/governor-mccrory-takes-action-legislation">stated</a> [press release release], "This law does not further limit access and those who contend it does are more interested in politics than the health and safety of our citizens." <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/30/us-usa-abortion-northcarolina-idUSBRE96T01X20130730">Abortion-rights advocates stated</a> [Reuters report] that by signing the bill into law, Governor McCrory broke earlier campaign promises that he would not sign legislation aimed at restricting access to abortions, and reported that they will continue to fight the restrictive new law.

<p>Recently, other states have attempted to pass similar regulations regarding abortion clinics. Earlier this month a judge for the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/alabama-abortion-law-delayed-by-federal-judge.php">delayed enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of an Alabama abortion law until March 2014. Also this month a judge for the US District Court for the District of North Dakota <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] a North Dakota abortion law, calling it unconstitutional. Also in July Texas Governor Rick Perry <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill number 2, which enacts three new restrictions on the practice of abortion, into law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.dohc.ie/publications/pdf/Protection_of_life_during_Pregnancy_Bill_2013.pdf?direct=1">Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill</a> [text, PDF] allows women to pursue an abortion to alleviate life-threatening conditions, including a women's own threat to commit suicide if refused a termination. The bill is Ireland's <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ireland-lawmakers-approve-legislation-allowing-abortion-when-mothers-life-at-risk.php">first legislation on abortion</a> [JURIST report] since 1867, which outlawed the practice with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The current maximum sentence for an abortion if 14 years. While the bill does grant women the right to an abortion in life-threatening conditions, amendments that would have allowed for an abortion in cases of rape or incest were <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ireland-lawmakers-approve-legislation-allowing-abortion-when-mothers-life-at-risk.php">withdrawn during the debate</a> [JURIST report] over the bill. Similar amendments permitting the procedure for cases of fatal fetal defects were also abandoned during debate. 

<p>Abortion restrictions are a contentious issue around the world. In May the Supreme Court of El Salvador <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57586726/pregnant-el-salvador-woman-denied-life-saving-abortion/">refused</a> [CBS report] to reconsider that country's complete ban on abortions, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-experts-urge-el-salvador-to-reconsider-abortion-policy.php">despite international urging</a> [JURSIT report] to do so. The court denied the request of doctors to perform a therapeutic abortion on a woman pregnant with a fetus developing without a brain where the woman's life was threatened by kidney failure and lupus symptoms aggravated by her pregnancy. After the ruling, El Salvador's health ministry <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/baby-el-salvador-woman-abortion-dies">allowed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the woman's doctors to perform a C-section in order to save her life because at 26 weeks, her pregnancy had advanced to a stage not regulated by the country's strict abortion laws. Ireland's new law amends the country's constitutional ban on abortion, so anti-abortion activists are likely to pursue a Supreme Court challenge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manning">news archive</a>] guilty of violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 794 et seq., text] for his disclosure of classified information to anti-secrecy organization, <a href="http://wikileaks.org">Wikileaks</a> [website]. The judge, however, acquitted Manning of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." In 2010 Manning leaked more than 700,000 government documents, diplomatic cables and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYTxuW2vmzk">controversial classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq that resulted in the deaths of numerous civilians and two Reuters journalists. The <a href="http://www.army.mil">US Army</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">formally charged</a> Manning in July 2010, but his bench trial did not <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/wikileaks-informant-trial-begins.php">begin</a> until last month at Forte Meade, Maryland, nearly three years after his <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">initial arrest</a> [JURIST reports]. Manning reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23508662">faces</a> [BBC report] approximately 136 months to life in prison. The court is expected to sentence Manning on Wednesday. According to media sources, several advocacy groups have <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/WikiLeaks+calls+Manning+verdict+extremism+others+have+mixed/8726616/story.html">decried the verdict</a> [AP report] as extremist while members of the US government have praised it as evenhanded. 

<p>Manning's case has sparked controversy across the globe since his arrest in 2010. In April the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces rejected a request by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) to have access to court documents from Manning's case. That month the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] such that the government was required to prove Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. In February Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against him for providing classified materials to Wikileaks. Also in February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a motion that argued for Manning's release based on a lack of a speedy trial. In January the judge ruled that prosecutors must prove that Manning knew he was aiding the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports]. In November the judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a partial guilty plea to several of the minor charges against Manning. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June the judge ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly withheld from the defense during discovery. Prior to that, Manning was held in solitary confinement at the Quantico Marine Base brig for 112 days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the court conceded that over-consumption of high sugar content beverages is directly related to an increase in diabetes and juvenile mortality rates, it held that the state constitution does not grant an executive agency the power to curb the portions of such drinks:<blockquote>Because the constitution vests legislative power in the legislature, administrative agencies may only effect policy mandated by statute and cannot exercise sweeping power to create whatever rule they deem necessary. In other words, "[as] an arm of the executive branch of government, an administrative agency may not, in the exercise of rule-making authority, engage in broad-based public policy determinations.</blockquote>The American Beverage Association, a plaintiff in the case, <a href="http://www.ameribev.org/blog/2013/07/hey-new-york-%E2%80%93-your-beverage-is-still-your-choice/">stated</a> [press release], "We are pleased that the lower court's decision was upheld. With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the people of New York City." Mayor Michael Bloomberg disagreed, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2013b%2Fpr261-13.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1">commenting</a> [press release], "Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic." 

<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/supctmanh/">New York Supreme Court</a> [official website] in March <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/sodaruling0311.pdf">permanently enjoined</a> [order, PDF] enforcement of amendments to the New York city <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/notice/2012/notice-adoption-amend-article81.pdf">regulation</a> [NYC Health Code 81.53, PDF] prohibiting the sale or provision of "sugary" beverages in large cups or containers by food service establishments. In October groups representing restaurants, beverage makers and movie theaters challenged the link between regulation-defined "sugary" drinks and obesity, and asserted that "food service establishments" were arbitrarily defined such that a New York City resident could purchase a large sugary beverage from one server after denial from another next door. The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/home/home.shtml">New York City Department of Health</a> [official website] approved Bloomberg's plan to promulgate the amended regulation in September, pursuant to which any establishment receiving a New York Health Department letter grade would be subject to a $200 fine for the sale of any sugary beverage in a container over 16 ounces. The NYDOH cited statistics connecting growing obesity and disease rates among NYC adults and children to increased portion sizes and the psychology of "thirst." Litigation over food health and safety has arisen in the past. In February 2009 the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="paperchase/2009/02/second-circuit-upholds-nyc-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New York City law that requires chain restaurants to post caloric content information on their menus and menu boards in an effort to address obesity rates. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Berlusconi was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">convicted</a> [JURIST] in October on charges that his media empire <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian] purchased television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declared the cost on its taxes.

He was found guilt of paying a 17-year-old dancer for sex while he was in office and for abusing his power by asking police to release her when she was being detained for an unrelated crime. The Milan court sentenced him to seven years in prison and barred him from public office for life. In Italy debarment is not effectuated until the appeals process has been exhausted. In May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/italy-prosecutors-accuse-berlusconi-of-bribing-senator.php">Italian prosecutors accused</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi of having paid former senator Sergio De Gregorio &#8364;3 million following the parliamentary election in 2006 to defect from the small Italy of Values party and join the center right.

On Friday the court permanently enjoined Hazleton's enforcement of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/immigrants/hazleton_secondordinance.pdf">Illegal Immigration Relief Act Ordinance</a> (IIRAO) [Ord. 2006-18, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/immigrants/hazleton_firstordinance.pdf">Rental Registration Ordinance</a> (RO) [Ord. 2006-13, PDF], which denied permits to business that employ undocumented immigrants and fined landlords who extended housing to them, respectively. The court said the employment provisions "stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and the execution" of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986's (IRCA) objectives, and the housing provisions undermine the "comprehensive procedures under which federal officials determine whether an alien may remain in this country," creating foreign policy and humanitarian concerns. The IIRAO attempted to make it unlawful to "knowingly recruit, hire for employment, or continue to employ, or to permit, dispatch, or instruct" any person without work authorization in Hazleton and required documented immigration status as condition precedent to entering into a rental lease. The RO required prospective renters to obtain an occupancy permit which required "proper identification showing proof of legal citizenship and/or residency." 

<p>The Third Circuit began <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">reconsidering the laws</a> [JURIST report] in August after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ordered it to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/the-us-supreme-court-official.php">reexamine the case</a> [JURIST report].

Last week the High Court of Kenya ruled against a government directive to transfer refugees from urban areas to refugee camps in Dadaab and Kakuma. UNHCR spokeswoman Fatoumata Lejeune-Kabastated stated that the "decision is important for the jurisprudence on refugees' rights not only in Kenya but also around the world." Although the directive was never implemented, the UNHCR claims it already had dire consequences for the protection and well-being of refugee communities in Nairobi and other cities in the country, causing reports of police harassment, detention and extortion of urban Somali refugees and asylum seekers to rise. Legal services for refugees were put on hold when the directive was issued last December, but Lejeune-Kabastated expressed hope that legal services will resume. Of the 600,000 refugees in Kenya, 51,000 live in urban areas. 

<p>In April the UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-refugee-agency-creates-mobile-court-to-serve-refugee-settlement-in-uganda.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] a "mobile" court to serve refugee settlements in Uganda. The project is intended to provide quicker access to justice as well as a deterrent to crime in Nakivale, which is home to more than 68,000 refugees. Last November the UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-concerned-for-civilians-affected-by-fighting-in-congo.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to all parties in the conflict in Democratic Republic of the Congo to avoid restricting access to the 31 refugee camps in the country. In September the UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-refugee-agency-issues-new-guidelines-on-detention-of-asylum-seekers.php">issued new international guidelines</a> [JURIST report] as part of an effort to promote alternatives to detention such as surrender of documentation, periodic reporting to authorities, directed residence or residence at free-movement asylum centers, bail or bond requirements, and community supervision arrangements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 2-1 decision, the Fifth Circuit reversed lower court decisions that said the location data was protected by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court stated that warrantless access is "not per se unconstitutional" because mobile location data is "clearly a business record" and therefore unprotected by the Fourth Amendment. Authorities were requesting cellphone data under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], part of the Electronics Communications Privacy Act, which the court stated gives authorities the option of obtaining a court order, but does not require the higher standard necessary for a search warrant. The Fifth Circuit is the third federal appeals court to allow authorities to track mobile devices without a warrant. 

<p>Courts and lawmakers remain divided on what types of warrants are required to perform cell phone searches. Last week the New Jersey Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-jersey-supreme-court-rules-warrants-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that police must obtain search warrants before obtaining tracking information from cell phone providers, marking the first time a state supreme court has recognized a Fourth Amendment protection for cell phone location data. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.maine.gov/legis/">Maine Legislature</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/maine-lawmakers-override-veto-to-pass-cell-phone-warrant-requirement.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a new law requiring police to obtain a warrant to track a cell phone. In May the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2013/sc11-1130.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that police <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/florida-top-court-rules-warrantless-cell-phone-searches-unconstitutional.php">need a warrant</a> [JURIST report] to search a defendant's cell phone at the time of arrest. In 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/files/CellPhones.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/seventh-circuit-upholds-warrantless-cell-phone-search.php">warrantless search</a> [JURIST report] of a suspect's cell phone to collect its phone number does not constitute a violation of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

D Bruce Hanes of Montgomery County was allegedly acting under the guidance of <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Kathleen Kane</a> [official website], who instructed him that the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Pennsylvania Marriage Law was no longer constitutional</a> under the Supreme Court's holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST reports]. Hanes announced his intentions to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on July 25 and was <a href="http://www.montcopa.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=390">initially lauded for his decision</a> [press release]. The Department of Health, which monitors marriage statistics for disease control purposes, disagreed, arguing:<blockquote>No public pronouncement of an executive official ... declaring his or her legal opinion that a law is unconstitutional relieves a public official from his mandatory duty to comply with the law. ... Absent a controlling opinion of a court of competent jurisdiction an administrative official such as a Clerk lacks lacks the power or discretion not to perform his duties.</blockquote>Also on Tuesday the <a href="http://www.ogc.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/office_of_general_counsel_-_home/1198">Governor's Office of General Counsel</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.philly.com/documents/Ltr+to+Adrian+King+%28Whitewood%29+07-30-13%5B2%5D.pdf">wrote</a>  [text, PDF] to the attorney general in defense of the Pennsylvania statute, arguing that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> does not strike down the state's marriage law, but just the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). A <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking same-sex marriage rights in Pennsylvania is currently pending.

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">DOMA ruling</a> [text, PDF] in June, <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">courts across the country have been citing the decision</a> [JURIST news archive]. In Michigan a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-blocks-michigans-ban-on-domestic-partner-benefits.php">blocked the state's ban</a> [JURIST report] on domestic partner benefits for employees who work for public schools or local governments. Last week a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of two men seeking recognition of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. Ohio law prohibits same-sex marriage but recognizes marriages solemnized outside of the state. James Obergefell and his partner, John Arthur, who suffers from a terminal illness, married legally in Maryland earlier this month and returned to Ohio where they have resided for nearly 20 years. Arthur sought to include Obergefell as his surviving spouse on his death certificate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson made his first official visit to Chile, finding that "the anti-terrorism legislation has been disproportionately and unfairly applied against Mapuche defendants, and has been implemented without a coherent policy for distinguishing those cases that meet the threshold test for an act of terrorism and those that do not." Referring to Chile's 1984 <a href="http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=29731">anti-terrorism law</a> [text, in Spanish], Emmerson addressed the impact that the law has on indigenous land protests. His statement stressed the need for an end to impunity for the crimes committed during violent land protests, adding that the victims of such violence should also have their rights adequately protected.

<p>In 2009, Chilean Subsecretary of the Interior Patricio Rosende announced that Chile would use the 1984 anti-terrorism law to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/chile-to-apply-antiterrorism-law-to.php">prosecute indigenous Mapuches</a> [JURIST report] for attacks allegedly committed in the southern region of Araucania. The Chilean government declared that it would apply the measure to criminals regardless of their ethnicity, and that only a minority of Mapuches were responsible for the attacks in an attempt to disturb negotiations over Mapuche demands. The government has been widely criticized by human rights organizations, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/11920/section/1">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="http://indigenouspeoplesissues.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2136%3Aoutcome-of-universal-periodic-review-on-chile-2009-united-nations-human-rights-council&catid=53%3Asouth-america-indigenous-peoples&Itemid=75&lang=en">UN Human Rights Council</a> [reports], which maintain that the anti-terrorism law unfairly singles out Mapuches, who are Chile's largest minority, accounting for an estimated 4 to 6 percent of the country's population. The law dates from the Pinochet regime and abrogates due process rights for the accused, including a longer wait before arraignment and access to a lawyer once charged. The law also allows the imposition of sanctions up to three times what is established by the Chilean Criminal Code, and considers that acts perpetrated with the general intent of causing fear in the general population or imposing demands upon authorities have a terrorist intent. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu-in.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kentucky/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky</a> [official website] after a <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title5/ar22/ch17.html">2011 Indiana law</a> [text] blocking the <a href="http://www.state.in.us/isdh/18934.htm">Indiana Department of Health</a> [official website] from signing contracts with any group that performs abortions, except hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, went into effect. The decision <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/apnews/ae53965436a644e1889e8adce868808e">marks</a> [AP report] the end of the two-year legal battle, making the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/10.23.12_opinion.pdf">2011 preliminary injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] permanent. The decision comes after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused in May to hear Indiana's appeal in the case. In its <a href="http://www.irtl.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Memo-in-Opposition-to-Motion-for-Preliminary-Injunction.pdf">memorandum in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF], the Commissioner of the Indiana State Department of Health argued that the plaintiffs had no cause of action to enforce the "freedom of choice" provision of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-7/subchapter-XIX">Medicaid Act</a> [text], the law was not unconstitutional, and public policy and the balance of equities favored the state.

<p>Last year the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the injunction. The court found that the law, which would block federal and state funding to all "entities which perform abortions," violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">Medicaid statute</a> [text] because it unjustifiably limited patient choice of health care providers. Even though federal and state funding may not be used for abortions after the <a href="http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf">Hyde Amendment</a> [backgrounder, PDF], Indiana lawmakers sought to remove all support to entities that provide abortions regardless of the source of the funding. The injunction allowed Planned Parenthood to continue serving its Medicaid patients pending a reversal on appeal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunionjack.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UK Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld a law against euthanasia. Tony Nicholson, now deceased, was the victim of a paralyzing stroke. Paul Lamb was severely paralyzed after a car accident. Both men challenged the UK's definition of murder, seeking medical assistance in committing suicide. In 2012 a UK High Court <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/nicklinson-v-moj.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/uk-court-allows-euthanasia-case-to-proceed.php">case could proceed to hearing</a> [JURIST report]. In a unanimous ruling, the judges said the two men had "permanent and catastrophic physical disabilities" but said the issue of euthanasia "raises profoundly sensitive questions about the nature of our society." The judges reasoned that "Parliament represents the conscience of the nation" and said the court had no jurisdiction to challenge the legal ban on euthanasia.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world. The only European countries that allow euthanasia are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In 2011, India's high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">ruled passive euthanasia was permitted</a> [JURIST report] under certain circumstances, but rejected a petition for a mercy killing. In 2010 a German court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">removing a patient from life support is not a criminal offense</a> [JURIST report] if the patient had previously given consent. In 2009, the Italian president <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refused to sign an Italian government decree</a> [JURIST report] that would stop the euthanasia of comatose women because it would violate the separation of power overturning a previous court ruling. In 2006 a proposed bill that would legalize the option of assisted suicide in the UK was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside by the House of Lords</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition from the public and two physician groups</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in 2006 the US Supreme Court upheld <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], the only American state law that allows physician assisted suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Billy Sell, 32, was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/amnesty-international-weighs-california-prisons-hunger-strike-015629832.html">found hanged in his cell</a> [Reuters report] last Monday at the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/COR.html">Corcoran State Prison</a> [official website] in central California. Prison officials originally reported in a preliminary suicide ruling that there was no evidence that Sell's participation in the ongoing hunger strike had anything to do with his suicide. However, they acknowledged that he had been taking part in the hunger strike for at least 10 days before his suicide. The hunger strikes began on July 8, with more than 30,000 inmates from approximately 24 California prisons refusing food to protest the allegedly cruel use of solitary confinement as punishment within the state's system. Before his suicide, Sell had been in solitary confinement for five years. AI reported that there are "severe negative psychological consequences of isolation" and that suicides are more prevalent among prisoners in solitary confinement than among the general prison population. Thenjiwe McHarris, senior campaigner of AI's US program stated, "Conditions for prisoners in solitary confinement in California are an affront to human rights and must end. No human being should be held under the deplorable conditions we have witnessed in California prisons for prolonged periods, even decades&#8212;this amounts to cruel, inhumane and degrading conditions."

<p>California has been under scrutiny for its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] since 2006, when the state's governor proclaimed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=4278">prison overcrowding state of emergency</a> [text]. In May 2011 the US Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/USSC-Plata-opinion09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a federal court order that California reduce its state prison population. The court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text], because it prevented the system from providing adequate medical and mental health care to inmates. In January of this year, <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-docs-01-07-13/Terminating-Prison-Overcrowding-Emergency-Proclamation-10-4-06.pdf">proclamation</a> [text, PDF], in order to effectively terminate the 2006 state of emergency. In this proclamation, the governor indicated that the circumstances giving rise to the prison overcrowding state of emergency no longer exist within California prisons. In April, however, a panel of federal judges refused to vacate or modify their <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/Order-population-reduction.pdf">2010 order</a> [text, PDF] for reduction of the California inmate population. This order mandated the state to reduce its prison population to within 137.5 percent of institutional design capacity. In May, Governor Brown and various state prison officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-governor-appeals-order-to-curb-prison-overcrowding.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] from the April order.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report noted that many civilian deaths have been <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12254&ctl=Details&mid=15756&ItemID=37114&language=en-US">caused by the increased use of improvised explosive devices</a> [UNAMA press release]. Women and children are also increasingly the victims in the country's war, with a 30 percent increase in the number of children killed. Additionally, almost 75 percent of civilian deaths during this time period were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/31/us-afghanistan-civilians-idUSBRE96U07V20130731">caused by Anti-Government Elements</a> [Reuters report] such as Taliban members, who were increasingly targeting civilians that they viewed as cooperating with the government. The report calls on the Afghanistan government to "continue to disband and disarm all armed groups and to take measures to ensure accountability for human rights abuses carried out by these groups." It also recommends that Anti-Government Elements comply with international humanitarian law and cease the targeted killing of civilians.

<p><a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been the target of much <a href="/hotline/2012/12/heather-barr-afghanistan-executions.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] regarding its human rights issues. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/afghanistan-should-reconsider-new-human-rights-appointees--un.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Afghanistan that recent appointments to its top human rights body compromise the country's independence. Pillay recommended that <a href="http://president.gov.af/en/news">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official website] reconsider the appointments and re-open the selection process. In October 2011 the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">UN released a report</a> [JURIST report] which indicated that nearly half of the 273 prisoners in Afghan-run detention facilities who were interviewed had been subject to torture. A month earlier, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report showing that the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">committing serious rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], and that officers were not being held accountable for these abuses. The UN also released a report in March of 2010 showing that human rights abuses in Afghanistan were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensifying the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report], which affected more than two-thirds of the country's population at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This comes amid <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Egypt">escalating political violence in Cairo</a> [JURIST news archive], as Duamelle already released one statement in March <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/66100/Egypt/Politics-/Rights-of-detained-children-in-Egypt-are-being-vio.aspx">warning</a> [<em>Ahram</em> report] that children's rights were being violated as an effect of the political violence. Duamelle said, "Such actions can have a long-lasting and devastating physical and psychological impact on children. We call on all Egyptians and political groups not to exploit children for political ends, and to protect them from any potential harm." Although the number of casualties is not yet confirmed, human rights groups in Egypt are <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/12/27/rights-activists-condemn-violence-against-children-during-clashes/">calling for investigations</a> [<em>Daily News Egypt</em> report] into the deaths of at least three children, while tens more are currently hospitalized for their injuries.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked this month in the wake of new developments. Both the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45515&Cr=Egypt&Cr1=#.UfpDkI21Gl4">Secretary-General</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx">High Commission for Human Rights</a> [statements] have engaged the current leadership in discussions about protecting human rights this week. On Saturday the UN urged the Egyptian government to ensure the application of law and order and to promote safety and security in dealing with protesters. The country's interim government also caused controversy earlier this month when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down</a> [JURIST report] four Islamist-run television stations that it viewed as sympathetic to ousted president Mohammed Morsi and his supporters. The country's government is currently being headed by the Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile], who took the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">oath</a> to become the interim head of state days after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST reports] Morsi and suspended the nation's constitution in early July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is the first member of Gaddafi's ministry to receive a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/gaddafi-minister-sentenced-to-death-in-libya-8740769.html">death sentence</a> [AP report], which is to be carried out via firing squad. Ibrahim was also a high ranking member of the "revolutionary committees," organizations of Gaddafi's loyalists known for enforcing his policies. Human rights activists have <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/31/icc-libya-should-comply-court-s-ruling">raised concerns</a> [HRW press release] that the Libyan criminal courts based in Misrata do not meet international standards.

<p>This conviction and sentencing come amid debate between the UN and Libya over the proper venue to try Gaddafi-era officials. Human rights groups and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] have raised objections to the fairness and due process procedures of the newly-established judicial system <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-rules-libya-cannot-try-gaddafi-son.php">multiple times</a> [JURIST report]. The ICC and the Libyan courts have both asserted that their own system is the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-orders-libya-to-turn-over-gaddafis-son.php">most appropriate venue</a> [JURIST report] for the trial of Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The ICC has been <a href="/feature/2013/07/involvement-in-libya.php">monitoring the conflict</a> [JURIST feature] since 2011, when the UN Security Council voted unanimously to refer the Libyan revolution to its venue.

The legislation <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/uruguay-marijuana-bill-passes-lower-house-20130801-2r2h1.html">passed</a> [AP report] by a vote of 50-46 but still has to be approved by the Senate in order to become effective. The bill is highly controversial, as the law is in contravention to the provisions of the international drug control treaties, such as the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1961_en.pdf">1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs</a> [text, PDF], to which Uruguay is a party. The bill was unveiled in June 2012 as part of a series of measures to combat rising violence. President Jose Mujica supports the legislation, believing that it will help combat drug trafficking and crime.

<p>Lawmakers formally proposed the framework for the regulation of the production, sale and consumption of marijuana in November in an attempt to reduce drug-related violence. While the use of cannabis is legal in Uruguay, the growth and sale of the drug is not. Marijuana use has created legal controversy around the world, especially in the US. In November US voters passed ballot initiatives to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalize marijuana</a> [JURIST report] for the first time on a statewide basis in both Colorado and Washington. In June 2012 the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html">Chicago City Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/chicago-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php">voted to decriminalize</a> [JURIST report] the possession of small amounts of marijuana, detailing that police officers may issue tickets to individuals found to be in possession of 10 grams of marijuana or less. In May of last year the Connecticut Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/connecticut-senate-approves-new-medicinal-marijuana-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing citizens to obtain marijuana for medical use under certain conditions, making Connecticut the seventeenth state to allow sale of marijuana for medical use. Other states that have passed similar laws have run into trouble with conflicting federal laws regulating the production and sale of marijuana. In March of last year the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-california-medical-marijuana-providers-not-shielded-from-federal-prosecution.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging US Attorneys' authority to prosecute medical marijuana providers in California. In January the <a href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-court-rules-montana-medical-marijuana-law-does-not-shield-providers-from-federal-prosecution.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's laws allowing the sale of medical marijuana did not protect dispensers from federal prosecution. Connecticut has nevertheless been taking steps toward legalization of marijuana, last year passing a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-senate-approves-marijuana-decriminalization-bill.php">decriminalizing possession</a> [JURIST report] of small amounts of marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0796-03000.pdf?20130731164630">law</a> [SB 2305, PDF] imposes requirements that any physician performing abortions in the state must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, but the Red River Clinic is frequently forced to fly in physicians from out of state. Any physician who fails to comply with the admitting privileges requirement could be prosecuted for a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $3,000 fine. <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/counties/cass.htm">Cass County District Court</a> [official website] Judge Wickham Corwin concluded his ruling by saying that enforcing the law would <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/abortion-rule-on-hospital-access-blocked-in-north-dakota.html">cause irreparable harm</a> [Bloomberg report] to the women who would have to travel out of state for abortions and to clinic employees who would lose their jobs. The decision temporarily blocks the law while the legal challenge continues. Director of the US legal program at the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] Bebe Anderson <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/state-judge-blocks-nd-law-designed-to-close-only-abortion-clinic-in-the-state">stated</a> [press release], "Today's decision ensures that North Dakota's only abortion clinic can keep its doors open to the many women it provides critical health care to every year." The center filed the lawsuit in May on behalf of the Red River Women's Clinic, the only abortion provider in North Dakota, which provides a range of reproductive health services to women.

<p>Another North Dakota abortion law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] last month by a judge for the <a href="http://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of North Dakota</a> [official website]. <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0304-02000.pdf?20130722170619">HB 1456</a> [test, PDF] is <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/22/19618223-federal-judge-blocks-most-restrictive-abortion-law-in-the-country?lite">one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country</a> [NBC report] and would prohibit abortions after the point at which cardiac activity can be detected in a pregnancy, or as early as six weeks. North Dakota is one of many <a href="/feature/2013/07/state-abortion-restrictions.php">states</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to enact restrictive abortion laws in recently. Earlier in July a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-dakota-judge-strikes-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] another North Dakota law placing limitations on drug-induced abortions. The Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an abortion bill which bans abortions after 20 weeks. Also last month <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-senate-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wisconsin-governor-signs-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Ohio</a> [JURIST reports] enacted laws which place restrictions on abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court stated, however, that JI may be re-registered if it amends its charter and reapplies for registration. The ruling came after a petition asserting that JI's charter <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/08/2013819424198348.html">breached the constitution</a> [Al Jazeera report] was lodged with the court in 2009. This decision comes as a victory for protesters who have <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/585048/bangladesh-court-declares-jamaat-e-islami-illegal/">demanded that JI be banned</a> [AFP report] due to its role in the 1971 <a href="http://www.independent-bangladesh.com/history/liberation-war-of-bangladesh.html">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [Bangladesh News backgrounder]. Protests have begun over the court's decision, and are anticipated to continue on. The ruling and subsequent protests came as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/08/01/blood-streets-0">report</a> [text] stating that at least 150 people have been killed in the country's ongoing protests since February. Brad Adams, Asia director of HRW, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/01/bangladesh-security-forces-kill-protesters">stated</a> [HRW report] that "[w]ith national elections and more war crimes verdicts ahead, street protests are likely to be frequent and the risk of further violence is high."

<p>The ongoing Bangladesh protests, which began in February, were sparked by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page] sentences against leaders of JI for their role in the country's 1971 war. In January the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-member-to-death.php">sentenced Abul Kalam Azad to death</a> [JURIST report]. In February the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Abdul Quader Mollah to life in prison and sentenced leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sayedee">Delwar Hossain Sayeedee</a> [JURIST news archive] to death. The death sentence <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-leader-to-death.php">sparked violent protests</a> [JURIST report], which left approximately 30 people dead and 300 wounded. In July the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-90-years-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced 90-year-old former JI leader</a> [JURIST report], Ghulam Azam, to 90 years in prison for crimes against humanity committed during the war. Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Azam, however, he was instead sentenced to 90 years because of his age and health. Also last month the war crimes tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-death-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced JI secretary-general</a> [JURIST report], Ali Ahsan Mojaheed, to death for kidnapping and killing people during the war and also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-charges-islamic-leader-with-1971-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] ATM Azharul Islam, the assistant secretary-general of the Islamic group, with six war crimes.

One of the couples is seeking to enter into a same-sex marriage, while the other couple is seeking recognition by the state of Virginia of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/complaintwithfilinginfo.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleges that Virginia's refusal to marry same-sex couples or to recognize their out-of-state marriages violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders]. Regarding the lawsuit, Claire Guthrie Gastanaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia <a href="https://acluva.org/13600/lambda-legal-and-aclu-file-federal-class-action-seeking-to-end-virginias-ban-on-marriage-for-same-sex-couples/">stated</a> [press release], "Every day that same-sex couples in Virginia are denied the freedom to marry, the government sends a message that they are second class citizens and their families are not worthy of equal dignity and respect."

<p>This lawsuit is the most recent of those filed in the wake of the recent US Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Virginia joins the list of other states that have recently taken measures regarding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. In March the ACLU of New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-new-mexico-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in a New Mexico state court on behalf of two same-sex couples seeking the legal right to marry. In the same month Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted in favor of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize civil unions in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US District Judge Richard Leon said that the Federal Reserve had misinterpreted the Durbin Amendment of the 2010 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/html/PLAW-111publ203.htm">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [text], which requires banks with more than $10 billion in assets to charge debit card interchange fees that are "reasonable and proportional to the actual cost" of processing the transaction. According to Leon, the purpose of the Durbin Amendment was to limit interchange fees to the actual cost of processing debit card transactions. Although the Federal Reserve's <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-12-28/pdf/2010-32061.pdf">initial proposal</a> [text, PDF] included a cap of 12 cents per transaction, the final rule was expanded to cover the cost of equipment and fraud-prevention technology, which the court held to be improper.

<p>The Dodd-Frank Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 and created the new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent companies from becoming "too big to fail." In addition to creating the US <a href="http://www.treas.gov/FSOC/">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [official website], the legislation also gives the Federal Reserve new oversight over the largest financial institutions, creates a bureau of consumer protection, introduces multitudes of new regulations on derivatives and other financial instruments, tasks the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) [official website] with regulating the derivatives market, and limits the amount of capital banks can invest in hedge funds. JURIST contributor Andrew Cali-Vasquez argues that position limit regulations may carry <a href="/dateline/2011/10/andrew-cali-vazquez-dodd-frank.php">unexpected consequences</a> [JURIST op-ed] that "could impinge upon the operations of domestic businesses by reducing the availability of financing." JURIST Guest Columnist Louise Bennetts gives a <a href="/hotline/2013/01/louise-bennetts-dodd-frank.php">critique of Dodd-Frank</a> [JURIST op-ed], arguing that its framework gives regulators considerably leeway to implement its measures as they see fit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Brad Adams, executive director of HRW's Asia Division, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/01/bangladesh-security-forces-kill-protesters">urged</a> [press release] the government to take firm action to rein in security forces before upcoming national elections and war crime verdicts, which are likely to carry with them an increased frequency of street protests and a higher risk of violence. HRW called on the Bangladeshi government to ensure that their security forces immediately stop using excessive force against protesters, and further asked that an independent commission be appointed to investigate the deaths of the protesters and that UN special rapporteurs be allowed into the country to conduct independent assessments.

The case reached a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-refuses-to-approve-citigroup-590-million-settlement.php">preliminary settlement in April</a> [JURIST report], but Judge Sidney Stein refused to approve it because the requested counsel fees and costs were over $90 million. Four months later, the total fees requested were over $100 million, but the judge approved only $73.6 million in fees on Thursday. Stein reasoned that "Although the $590 million recovery is a fraction of the damages that might have been won at trial, it is substantial and reasonable in light of the risks faced if the action proceeded to trial."

<p>Citigroup's shareholders <a href="http://securities.stanford.edu/1038/C_01/2008819_r01k_0709901.pdf">filed</a> [docket, PDF] this class action suit against the investment bank in 2007, in which they accused the company of making false or misleading statements regarding tens of billions of dollars of toxic mortgage assets. Citigroup filed a motion to dismiss in 2011 upon removal of the action to federal court, but Stein <a href="http://clients.oakbridgeins.com/clients/blog/citierisa111411.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] it. In the same month, Judge Jed Rakoff, sitting on the same court as Stein, <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-citigroup-sec-settlement.php">blocked a proposal</a> [JURIST report] by Citigroup to settle with the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for $285 million in another case because he said the SEC failed to set forth any facts as to what Citigroup did that was against the public interest, a decision <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/2011-265-notice.pdf">appealed</a> [notice of appeal, PDF] by the SEC. Rakoff had also rejected Citigroup's initial settlement agreement of $75 million with the SEC a year earlier. Some critics have <a href="/sidebar/2012/01/bondi-fischer-sec-citigroup.php">cautioned against the growing practice</a> [JURIST op-ed] of judicial settlement blocking, warning that if defendants force the SEC to prove its allegations at trial as opposed to attempted settlement, the SEC might become more selective in bringing enforcement actions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The text of the bill also emphasizes the historical medicinal uses of the plant and multiple studies showing it is effective treatment for those with long-term pain and suffering. Upon signing, Quinn stated, "This new law will provide that relief and help eligible patients ease their suffering, while making sure Illinois has the nation&#8217;s strictest safeguards to prevent abuse." He was joined by multiple members of the Illinois legislature who <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/illinois-senate-approves-medical-marijuana-bill.php">approved the bill in May</a> [JURIST report] and noted the safeguards put in place to avoid abuse of prescriptions, and the underlying need to relieve chronic pain. 

<p>The sale and use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. In May the Vermont State Legislature approved a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/vermont-legislature-votes-to-decriminalize-small-amounts-of-marijuana.php">replaces criminal penalties with civil fines</a> [JURIST report] for possession of up to an ounce of marijuana and up to five grams of hashish. Also in May the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the private sale of medical marijuana is <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge ruled that the state's <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington </a>, <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [bill texts, Harvard Crimson report] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives and referendums. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's decision upholds a four-year prison sentence, marking his first definitive court conviction after years of court battles over charges, including paying a minor for sex. The court, however, declined to rule on the lower appeals court five-year ban on political office, sending the matter back to the lower court for reconsideration. Despite the ruling, it is still unlikely that Berlusconi will ever serve time due to the statute of limitations and the fact that the case took six years to complete. In a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23544129">video message</a> [video, in Italian] released after the verdict, Berlusconi called the sentence "irresponsible," stating that the judicial authority to hand out jail sentences is the "most terrible of powers."

<p>Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases but has never served a single prison sentence due to either successfully appealing or having the statute of limitations on the charge expire. In addition to the tax fraud charges, he is also facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports] and abusing his power by having the police release her. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a immunity law backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Simonovic <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45545&Cr=central+african+republic&Cr1=#.Ufu_Y2Q6VYk">described</a> [UN News Centre report] the weak transitional government, lack of social services, lack of police protection and the alarming state of the justice system. He stated that the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=central+african+republic">country</a> [JURIST news archive] has reached an "unprecedented" level of violence and destruction since last December, when the Seleka coalition forces from the north launched their offensive. He also spoke of his concern that there has been a lack of attention given to the humanitarian and human rights situation in CAR, both by the media and the international community. Stressing the importance of transnational justice, Simonovic stated that perpetrators of human rights violations should not remain unpunished.

<p>In April UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-abuses-in-central-african-republic.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses in CAR.

Also in March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned the coup</a> [JURIST report] by the Seleka rebels and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order." The African Union also condemned the coup and suspended CAR from the Union in addition to imposing sanctions against the country. The CAR has also recently been criticized for its use of child soldiers. In January UNICEF said that it had received "credible reports" of both pro-government and rebel groups in the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">recruiting and including children in its conflict</a> [JURIST report].

Speaking at the US embassy in London, Kerry stated, "As long as a marriage has been performed in the jurisdiction that recognizes it, then that marriage is valid under US immigration laws. Every married couple will be treated exactly the same, and that is what we believe is appropriate." US immigration officials <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=2543215c310af310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=2543215c310af310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">announced</a> [text] a similar shift in official policy last month, which allows same-sex partners to receive the same review as opposite-sex couples when filing a petition with <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. The new visa policy will allow same-sex couples to travel to the US for work or study once one spouse is issued a visa. Kerry also added that the measure will allow even same-sex couples applying from countries that do not legally recognize their marriage to receive equal treatment as opposite-sex couples when applying for visas in the US.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] legislation has been passed in a number of states, eventually finding its way to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in two landmark same-sex marriage cases. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v.

The six-justice majority offered no explanation for their ruling. Three justices dissented, calling the injunction a "terrible injunction." State officials, however, have argued that releasing the prisoners poses a risk to public safety. The state plans to appeal the the decision on the merits of the case.

<p>The Supreme Court's decision is the end of a legal battle that began when the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> first <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-April-2013/Coleman-Termination-Order.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] in the 1995 that mental health and medical care for inmates was so bad that the state's prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. In 2006 the state's governor proclaimed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=4278">prison overcrowding state of emergency</a> [text]. In May 2011 the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/USSC-Plata-opinion09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the federal three-judge panel's order that California reduce its state prison population. The court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] because it prevented the system from providing adequate medical and mental health care to inmates. In January Governor Jerry Brown issued a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-docs-01-07-13/Terminating-Prison-Overcrowding-Emergency-Proclamation-10-4-06.pdf">proclamation</a> [text, PDF], which will effectively terminate the 2006 state of emergency. In this proclamation, the governor indicated that the circumstances giving rise to the prison overcrowding state of emergency no longer exist within California prisons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the law requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/03/federal-judge-blocks-wisconsin-abortion-law-through-fall-trial/">within 30 miles of their clinics</a> [WP report] and administer a mandatory ultrasound before a woman receives an abortion. US District Judge William Conley, presiding over the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], issued a stay on the law last month, remarking that any possible benefit is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/03/us-usa-abortion-wisconsin-idUSBRE97201Z20130803">greatly outweighed by the burdens</a> [Reuters report] resulting from the law's implementation. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website], one of a number of litigants challenging the law, claims that, if upheld, the law would force half of the state's four clinics to close their doors. Trial is scheduled to begin on November 25. 

<p>Recently, other states have attempted to pass similar regulations regarding abortion clinics. This week North Carolina <a href="http://www.patmccrory.com/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-governor-signs-abortion-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] into law that requires abortion clinics to meet requirements similar to those for outpatient surgical centers. Earlier in July a judge for the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/alabama-abortion-law-delayed-by-federal-judge.php">delayed enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of an Alabama abortion law until March 2014. Also last month a judge for the US District Court for the District of North Dakota <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] a North Dakota abortion law, calling it unconstitutional. Furthering a similar trend, Texas Governor Rick Perry <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill number 2, which enacts three new restrictions on the practice of abortion, into law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In June the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/145748960/ITC-rules-some-Apple-iPhones-and-iPads-infringe-on-Samsung-patents">banned the import or sale</a> [text, PDF] of AT&#38;T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G after finding that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-trade-commission-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">devices violated a patent</a> [JURIST report] held by <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung Electronics</a> [corporate website]. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said that the decision was in part based on its "effect on competitive conditions in the US economy and the effect on US consumers." The Obama administration has been pressing for most infringements of standard essential patents to be punished by monetary fines instead of sales injunctions. ITC cases can be appealed to the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website], and from there to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Froman noted in the statement that the ITC is "looking forward to the development of appellate jurisprudence on this issue."

<p>The ITC panel ruling is the most recent event in a <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">protracted patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] between <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> [corporate website] and Samsung that spans over four continents. The two companies have been engaged in patent litigation since 2010, each filing lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. In June the Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-suit.php">ruled for Apple</a> [JURIST report] in a patent infringement suit. Similarly in March a UK court also ruled for Apple <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">permitting continued use of technology</a> [JURIST report] that allows transfers of information over the third-generation networks that are used by smartphones. In January a Dutch court ruled that the designs of some Galaxy Tab models produced by Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/dutch-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">do not infringe designs patented by Apple</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Between July 22 and July 26, footage taken by opposition forces was posted on the Internet depicting government soldiers being ordered to lie on the ground, while other videos show several bodies scattered along a wall and a number of bodies at an adjacent site. Pillay noted in her statement:<blockquote>Based on the analysis by my team to date, we believe armed opposition groups in one incident&#8212;documented by a video&#8212;executed at least 30 individuals, the majority of whom appeared to be soldiers. ... [T]he events in Khan Al-Assal are further evidence that flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed by all parties have tragically become the norm in the Syrian conflict.</blockquote>Pillay has said that allegations that armed opposition groups in Syria executed dozens of government soldiers captured after a battle in Khan Al-Assal in July are "deeply shocking" and highlighted yet again the need to ensure those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law on all sides are made to account for their crimes.

<p>Established by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in August 2011, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria has been mandated to investigate and record all violations of international human rights law during the Syria conflict. In July the Chair of the commission <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace the country. In May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">Pillay expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile]. The increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust President Bashar Al-Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The attack, which took place in 2011 approximately 40 miles off the coast of Somalia, involved 19 Somali pirates who held the Americans captive in hopes of a million dollar ransom.

Each defendant was <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23560362">sentenced</a> [BBC report] to 624 years for the use of deadly force during the riot, which was one of the worst of its kind in Latin America, but no convicted person can serve more than 30 years in prison under Brazilian law. The ruling marks the second part of a four-section trial concerning the riot. The defense lawyers commented that they plan to appeal the ruling, arguing that the officers were threatened and fired in self-defense.

<p>Brazil has been working to fight corruption since the 2005 "Mensalao" scandal. In March the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-group-expresses-concern-about-excessive-detention-in-brazil.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about excessive detention and lack of legal assistance in Brazil, after a 10-day visit to the country. Last November the Supreme Court of Brazil sentenced a former aide to ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to over 10 years of <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/brazil-high-court-sentences-ex-presidential-aid-for-corruption.php">imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the vote-buying scheme. Jose Dirceu, Lula's former chief of staff, was convicted of using public funds to pay coalition parties for political support. The trials of those accused of participating in "Mensalao" were hailed as a potential <a href="ZkZQ27Q3EQ25Blaaf40ZlQ3EQ25BQ27ryQ25aQ27ZryrQ25ol4yrQ25Q7BlaQ25jfmZBZQ27kQ25rQ51r0yQ5BQ23o0Q5Bk">turning point</a> [NYT report] for Brazil in the its fight against corruption. In August 2011 Brazilian Judge Patricia Acioli, known for taking a hard-line against corrupt officials and militia death squads, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-judge-who-jailed-corrupt-officials-killed.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] outside of her home by two masked men on motorbikes.

Retired general <a href="http://www.ilkerbasbug.com.tr/">Ilker Basbug</a> [personal website, in Turkish; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16438136">profile</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-general-arrested-for-alleged-connection-to-ergenekon-plot.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 for his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] network, a secular group suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. Basbug was one of some 250 defendants accused of plotting high-profile attacks aimed at sowing chaos in Turkey to prepare the way for a military coup. Prosecutors in the trial maintain that the Ergenekon was behind a series of violent acts, including one in 2006 on a courthouse that killed a judge, that were made to look as though they were carried out by Islamic militants in a bid to create turmoil and provoke a military intervention. At least 16 other defendants were sentenced to life in prison, including 10 retired military officers, while 60 other defendants received sentences ranging from a year to 47 years. At least 21 people were acquitted. The verdicts cap a five-year trial that has generated tension between the country's secular elite and Erdogan's Islamic-oriented AKP.

<p>The case has sparked protests and polarized the country between those who see it as an opportunity to unravel a network of ultra-nationalists and those who believe it is a government attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report], but the government denies any such charge.. On Monday police blocked hundreds of demonstrators from reaching the courthouse in Silivri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Istanbul, in a show of solidarity with the defendants. Other high-profile defendants in the case include <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/turkish-journalist-arrested-in.php">Mustafa Balbay</a> [JURIST report], the Ankara representative of the <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr">Cumhuriyet</a> [media website, in Turkish] newspaper, and Mehmet Haberal, a surgeon and founder of a university in Ankara. Both faced life prison terms, but received sentences of 34 years and 12 years, respectively. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.etilaf.org">National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces</a> (ETILAF) [official website, in Arabic] allege that Assad committed crimes against humanity by using ballistic missiles, toxic gas and chemical weapons. The coalition further accuses Assad's forces of summarily executing civilians, burning them and targeting towns, villages, schools, hospitals and places of worship across Syria. The coalition said it was ready to cooperate in any independent probe:<blockquote>The Coalition reiterates its full commitment to international conventions, emphasizing that those who violate international human rights law must be brought to justice regardless of who they might be and further expresses its readiness to cooperate with all independent organisations to conduct impartial investigations into the war crimes committed across Syria.</blockquote>The coalition's call comes two days after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said a <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-calls-for-independent-probe-of-syria-war-crimes.php">reported mass execution by rebels</a> [JURIST report] of Syrian soldiers taken captive in the northern town of Khan al-Assal should be investigated. The coalition urged Pillay to immediately begin an investigation into the numerous massacres that have taken place during the holy month of Ramadan.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene.

In May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">Pillay expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This lawsuit, which aimed to represent 150,000 female Wal-Mart employees, was an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/walmart-gender-bias-suit_n_3700598.html">attempt to file a smaller representative version</a> [AP report] of an earlier gender discrimination class action lawsuit estimated to include more than 1.5 million women. The earlier lawsuit was filed in 2001 by female Wal-Mart employees who contended that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies resulted in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the group of women who sought to recover damages from Wal-Mart failed to meet the requirements for class certification. The district judge stated in Friday's ruling that this smaller suit remained too disparate to qualify as a class action lawsuit and that plaintiffs' lawyers failed to show qualifying evidence of gender bias. Plaintiffs' attorney, Randy Renick, stated he planned to appeal the judgment and that they were "deeply disappointed in the court's decision regarding what we remain convinced is a strong class action case against Wal-Mart for wide scale gender discrimination." 

<p>This is the most recent lawsuit of those filed against Wal-Mart in past years. In June of last year New York City <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/new-york-city-files-suit-against-wal-mart.php">filed a derivative suit</a> [JURIST report] in Delaware Chancery Court against Wal-Mart, alleging that both officers and board members of the company breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by improperly handling reports of bribery that occurred in Mexico. In June of 2011 a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-sets-deadline-in-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-suit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a group of women seeking to recover damages from Wal-Mart could file lawsuits until October of that year. This ruling came after the US Supreme Court rejected the 2001 class action, and applied to the women who had received the required permission to sue from the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website]. In February 2011 Wal-Mart also escaped liability after a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-upholds-wal-mart-firing-of-medical-marijuana-user.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Wal-Mart did not wrongly fire an employee who had been using medical marijuana to treat a brain tumor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cuba <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/amnesty-names-5-cubans-prisoners-conscience-020556342.html">denies holding political prisoners</a> [AP report] and has recently cleared its jails of internationally recognized prisoners of conscience. The last of approximately 75 dissidents sentenced to prison terms after a 2003 crackdown walked free in 2011 under a deal between Cuba and the Roman Catholic church. AI stated, however, that journalist Calixto Martinez was named a prisoner of conscience in January and freed months later without ever receiving a formal charge. Two of the current prisoners of conscience belong to a dissident group called the Patriotic Union of Cuba, and one to the Ladies in White. Javier Zuniga, Special Advisor for AI stated, "The only progress made by the Cuban government has been the reform of the Migration Law earlier this year. It allowed many people including human rights defenders and government critics to travel abroad. Much more needs to be done to guarantee civil and political liberties in the country."

<p>Cuba has had a history of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2011/cuba">suppressing political dissent</a> [HRW backgrounder] through the holding of prisoners of conscience or criminal prosecutions. In January various dissident groups, such as the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/cuba-rights-abuses-against-political-opposition-increasing-report.php">said that the Cuban government imprisoned more than 6,000 political activists</a> [JURIST report] in 2012. Last August AI <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-cuba-must-stop-harassing-political-activists.php">called on Cuba to end its harassment</a> [JURIST report] of political opposition. Last July both AI and the US government <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-amnesty-international-criticize-cuba-for-treatment-of-dissidents.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Cuba for how it treated political opposition. In December 2011 the government announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/cuba-announces-release-of-2900-political-prisoners.php">grant amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to and release 2,900 prisoners, including political prisoners.

<p>Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government and create an Islamic state and has warned Christians in the mostly Muslim northern regions to leave the area.

Ballistic missiles with large payloads of high-explosives have a wide-area destructive effect, making it impossible to isolate its devastation to single human targets, so HRW has said that military commanders should not order the use of ballistic missiles in areas populated by civilians. The nine attacks HRW investigated caused significant civilian damage with no apparent military advantage, strongly suggesting that the military willfully used methods of warfare incapable of distinguishing between civilians and combatants in violation of international humanitarian law. According to the <a href="http://www.syrianhr.org/">Syrian Network for Human Rights</a> (SNHR) [advocacy website], a Syrian human rights group, the Syrian government has used at least 131 long range surface-to-surface missiles between December 2012 and early July.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene.

More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Ggabo supporters were <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">jailed in 2010</a> [JURIST news archive] for inciting violence after their party, the Popular Front (FPI), disputed the election results. The opposition party was also accused of participating in the violence, but none of its members was imprisoned under the winner of that election, current President Alassane Ouattara. Government spokesperson Bruno Kone said, "The Board took note of this decision and hopes that it will contribute to the socio-political climate of appeasement and it will also help to accelerate the process of reconciling Ivorians." The group of 14 were granted provisional release within hours of the statement and will be required to attend future judicial proceedings, per sections 140 and 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Ivory Coast.

The bill, proposed by majority party member Worachai Hema, would excuse the behavior of all members of the military and police forces who were accused of malfeasance following the 2006 coup that ousted former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thaksin">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive]. HRW's executive director of said, "To ensure justice for the victims of violence and to end Thailand's longstanding culture of impunity, the amnesty bill should exclude perpetrators of abuses and instead make them accountable for their crimes."

The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/executions/pages/srexecutionsindex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a> [official website], called for a thorough, transparent and independent investigation of at least 46 cases of alleged arbitrary executions. The UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/JuanMendez.aspx">Juan Mendez</a> [official website], stated that at least 25 people reportedly died from torture or other degrading treatment, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official website], commented that several cases of violence against women, in particular sexual abuse and rape, were reported in all localities Seleka combatants have passed through. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/DisappearancesIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Enforced Disappearances</a> [official website] received information on alleged cases of enforced disappearances and expressed concern at allegations that a number of civilians as well as officers and soldiers of the official army were abducted by armed Seleka groups.

<p>UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic last Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-warns-international-community-on-central-african-republic.php">held a press conference</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR, where he urged the international community to remember the fragile state of the country. Stressing the importance of transnational justice, Simonovic stated that perpetrators of human rights violations should not remain unpunished. Last April UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-abuses-in-central-african-republic.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses in CAR. In March 2013, several rebel movements formed the Seleka, resumed hostilities against the government, and assumed power. In March Michel Djotodia declared in a radio address that the country's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/central-african-republic-rebels-dissolve-constitution.php">constitution was dissolved</a> [JURIST report] and that he had become the nation's leader. Also in March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned the coup</a> [JURIST report] by the Seleka rebels and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order." The African Union also condemned the coup and suspended CAR from the Union in addition to imposing sanctions against the country. The CAR has also recently been criticized for its use of child soldiers. A transitional government, lead by Djotodia, was formed in June 2013. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result of the ruling, Khodorkovsky <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/06/us-russia-khodorkovsky-idUSBRE9750NT20130806">should now be released from prison</a> [Reuters report] in August 2014, with Lebedev due for release a few months earlier. This ruling came in the wake of the recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/europe-rights-court-rules-khodorkovsky-trial-was-not-political.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], where the court determined that the 2005 trial of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev was not politically motivated. The ECHR did, however, did find that various aspects of the court proceedings had violated articles of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. After the ECHR ruling, lawyers for Khodorkovsky and Lebedev argued that Russia should immediately quash the convictions and release the men from prison. After Tuesday's ruling, Khodorkovsky's lawyer reported that he would appeal once again, with hope that Khodorkovsky would be released prior to August of next year.

<p>Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are each serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering. In 2010 former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] testified that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin&page=2">news archive</a>] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Khodorkovsky for political reasons. Kasyanov stated that Putin indicated that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without approval from the president, prompting his arrest. In December the <a href="http://www.anticorruption.bg/ombudsman/eng/readnews.php?id=6081&lang=en&t_style=tex&l_style=default">Human Rights Ombudsman</a> [backgrounder] in Russia, <a href="http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/People/Luk/lukin1.html">Vladimir Lukin</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russian-human-rights-official-appeals-ruling-against-khodorkovsky.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in a Moscow court following the ruling against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, because the two men were ordered to pay restitution for the same losses twice, once in 2005 and once in 2010. In the same month, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-court-reduces-khodorkovsky-sentence.php">had their sentences commuted</a> [JURIST report] by the Moscow City Court from 13 years to 11 years, making both men eligible for release in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decree requires all foreign websites to have at least one server in Vietnam, which would give greater content control to the Vietnamese government. The US embassy stated that the new law, which is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/06/net-us-vietnam-internet-idUSBRE9750HR20130806?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews">set to take effect in September</a> [Reuters report], is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], as well as those under the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text].

Incorporated, <a href="http://www.asiainternetcoalition.org/press_detail.php?id=75">stated</a> [press release] that "the Decree will stifle innovation and discourage businesses from operating in Vietnam." Although the new law will outlaw any Internet content that harms national security and declines to elaborate on what will constitute a security breach, the Vietnamese government stated that the decree is misunderstood and will not ban people from information-sharing.

<p>This is the most recent criticism against the Vietnamese government for its history of suppressing dissident activity. In February 22 Vietnamese activists were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/vietnam-court-hands-down-lengthy-prison-sentences-to-local-dissidents.php">sentenced to lengthy prison terms</a> [JURIST report] after the group was convicted of engaging in subversive activities to overthrow the county's communist government. Also in February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] stated in its <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-releases-annual-world-report.php">annual World Report</a> [JURIST report] that Vietnam's government has been "systematically suppressing freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and persecuting those who question government policies, expose official corruption, or call for democratic alternatives to one-party rule" during the last few years. In January Vietnamese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/vietnam-releases-american-activist.php">released and deported</a> [JURIST report] Vietnamese-American pro-democracy activist Nguyen Quoc Quan after a nine-month detention. Quan was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/vietnam-arrests-vietnamese-american-activist-for-terrorism.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on terrorism charges for planning protests in support of a banned group of US exiles. In the same month Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/vietnam-court-convicts-14-bloggers-of-subversion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 14 bloggers of subversion and issued prison sentences ranging from 3 to 13 years. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Matthei oversaw the military facility where General Alberto Bachelet was tortured to death in 1973 after Bachelet refused to support the military coup lead by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3758403.stm">Augusto Pinochet</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pinochet">news archive</a>]. Contreras has attempted to bring charges against Matthei before and argued that new evidence has come to light which shows that Matthei was aware of Banchelet's death. However, Carroza <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23584171">ruled</a> [BBC report] that there were insufficient grounds to prosecute. Contreras frequently represents families who were victimized during Pinochet's regime and has stated his intention to appeal Monday's decision. Both of the general's daughters, Evelyn Matthei and Michelle Bachelet, are opponents in the upcoming Chilean presidential election.  

<p>Chile has been urged to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for the killings and disappearances that took place during Pinochet's rule. In September a Chilean judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/police-chief-under-pinochet-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-for-murder.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] the chief of police during Pinochet's reign to 15 years in prison for murdering an opposition activist. One month prior, a panel of <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/chile-urged-to-ensure-ensure-justice-for-victims-of-enforced-disappearances.php">human rights experts urged Chile</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that those who have been convicted of enforced disappearances serve their sentences. In July 2012 Chilean authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/chile-charges-former-air-force-colonels-with-1974-torture-death-of-brigadier-general.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] two retired air force colonels for their roles in the 1974 death of an air force brigadier general and father of Chile's first female president. In December 2010 a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-court-convicts-13-chilean-officials-for-pinochet-era-disappearances.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 13 former Chilean officials for the disappearance of four French citizens during Pinochet's rule. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint alleges that BOA deceived investors regarding the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-06/justice-department-sues-bank-of-america-over-mortgages.html">level of risk</a> [Bloomberg report] associated with their products&#8212;specifically, the mortgage loans supporting the residential mortgage-backed securities. US Attorney Anne Tompkins elaborated on the DOJ's position, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-ag-886.html">stating</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Bank of America's reckless and fraudulent origination and securitization practices in the lead-up to the financial crisis caused significant losses to investors. Now, Bank of America will have to face the consequences of its actions. We have made a commitment to the American people to hold financial institutions accountable for practices that violated the law and wreaked havoc on the financial system.</blockquote>The DOJ named the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and Wachovia Bank as two of the five institutional <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/12000944/1/justice-department-sues-bank-of-america-for-mortgage-fraud.html">investors defrauded by BOA</a> [The Street report]. 

<p>BOA has faced numerous legal challenges stemming from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=financial+crisis">financial crisis of 2007-08</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January BOA <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/boa-reaches-10-billion-settlement-with-fannie-mae-over-faulty-lending-practices.php">reached a $10 billion settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Fannie Mae over faulty lending practices. Last October <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/spotlight/bharara.html">US Attorney Preet Bharara</a> [official profile] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-sues-bank-of-america-for-1-billion-in-mortgage-fraud-case.php">$1 billion civil lawsuit against BOA</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website], with similar claims that BOA subsidiary Countrywide Financial committed fraud in originating residential mortgages. In September BOA <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bank-of-america-settles-class-action-suit-over-merrill-lynch-acquisition.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a $2.43 billion class action lawsuit with investors over their $18.5 billion acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In July 2012 BOA agreed to pay <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/bank-of-america-settles-bond-insurer-lawsuit-for-375-million.php">$375 million</a> [JURIST report] in a settlement with bond insurer <a href="http://www.syncora.com/?site_id=2">Syncora Guarantee</a> [corporate website] over claims that Syncora was misled into insuring toxic mortgage-backed securities of Countrywide Financial. Also that month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-shareholder-lawsuit-against-bank-of-america.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by BOA to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging BOA's purposeful concealment of the bank's exposure to billions of dollars in loan repurchase claims and its problematic reliance on an electronic loan registry. In December 2011 BOA reached a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-315-million-to-settle-investor-claims-of-deceipt.php">$315 million settlement</a> of claims brought by investors alleging they were misled with respect to mortgage-backed investments, and a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-335-million-to-settle-discriminatory-lending-claims.php">$335 million settlement</a> [JURIST reports] with the DOJ, relating to discriminatory lending practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 54-page filing, the Texas officials argued that the Obama administration cannot impose preclearance on Texas while remaining faithful to the constitutional principles evoked in the recent Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/shelby-county-v-holder/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Shelby County v. Holder</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. According to the response:<blockquote>The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County makes clear that the extreme sovereignty-infringing remedy of preclearance is constitutionally suspect and may be applied only in response to rampant, widespread, recalcitrant discrimination akin to what originally justified the preclearance regime in 1965.</blockquote>The state of Texas and the Obama administration are relying on <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/08/texas-fights-new-voting-supervision/#more-168201">differing interpretations of section 3</a> [SCOTUSblog report] of the VRA. 

<p>In late June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">ruled</a> [JURST report] 5-4 in <span class="casename">Shelby County</span> that section 4 of the VRA is unconstitutional, and its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Thomas would have struck down section 5 based on the same reasoning the court used to strike section 4. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. According to Ginsburg, Congress, and not the Court should decide whether section 5 "remains justifiable." Congress voted in 2006 to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/bush-signs-bill-extending-voting.php">extend the VRA</a> [JURIST report] for another 25 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manning's convictions for sentencing purposes, reducing the possible maximum sentence from 136 to 90 years. Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 20 counts of espionage, theft, and fraud last week for releasing military documents to Wikileaks. Linde <a href="http://rt.com/usa/manning-trial-judge-lind-119/">combined</a>  [RT report] 16 of the 20 counts <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/748540-ruling-defense-motion-to-merge-charges.html">based on the relationship of the acts</a> [text, PDF]. Lind grouped the conviction of theft of Iraq War logs with wrongfully storing classified information, and further grouped Manning's theft of Iraq War logs, Afghan War logs and the Guantanamo files with the respective Espionage Act convictions.The maximum sentence he faces is now 90 years, a slight increase over the defense's request for a maximum of 85. The military proceedings are expected to continue for several more days before a final sentence is handed down. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/748540-ruling-defense-motion-to-merge-charges.html">online petition</a> [text] in support of Manning has garnered 2,500 volunteers to serve part of his sentence. 3,000 signatures are required before the court must acknowledge it. Others have started <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/featured/supporters-in-more-than-40-cities-rally-in-support-of-bradley-manning">peaceful demonstrations</a> [advocacy website] calling on General Buchanan, the court official who will review Lind's sentence, to free Manning.

<p>Manning's case has sparked controversy across the globe since his <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manning">arrest in 2010</a> [JURIST news archive]. There have been several issues raised regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">burden of proof</a> required to convict Manning of aiding the enemy, as well as <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/military-appeals-court-rejects-requests-to-open-wikileaks-court-martial-documents.php">arguments for greater transparency</a> [JURIST reports] into military proceedings. Likewise, issues circulated around the use of force being excessive. It was eventually <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">ruled illegal</a> [JURIST report], and Lind agreed to grant Manning time served for the 112 days he was left in solitary confinement at Quantico Marine Base.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The sealed complaint was filed in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] against an unspecified number of individuals. The charges are the first filed in connection with the <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/11/us-diplomatic-office-in-benghazi-attacked/">September 2012 attack</a> [<em>Libya Herald</em> report] on the US embassy and the death of US Ambassador J.

An anonymous official said that those charged included Ahmed Abu Khattala, the head of the Libyan militia group, Ansar Al-Sharia, which has also been linked to the raid. The group <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/14/suspects-arrested-in-us-ambassador-murder-abushagour/">agreed to disband</a> [<em>Libya Herald</em> report] and four of its members were arrested after the attacks under suspicion of being involved in the raid.

<p>Republicans in Congress have condemned the Obama administration's handling of the matter, criticizing the level of embassy security and questioning the talking points provided to UN Ambassador Susan Rice for her public explanation of the attack. Conservatives have suggested that the White House tried to play down the incident to minimize its effect on the president's campaign. DOJ spokesman Andrew Ames commented that "the department's investigation is ongoing. It has been, and remains, a top priority."</p>]]></content:encoded>

DOJ attorneys filed the notice of appeal with the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website]. They argue that the <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/37.pdf">law</a> [text, PDF] is designed to ensure continuity of care. Opponents of the law, including <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/Wisconsin/">Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin</a> and Affiliated Medical Services, allege that the law would force the organizations to close two clinics in Appleton and Milwaukee because providers at both facilities lack admitting privileges.

<p>A number of states have recently passed laws relating to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=reproductive+rights">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In July Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed abortion restrictions into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring women to first undergo ultrasounds. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] signed a measure <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation</a> [JURIST report] based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." That law has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">blocked by a federal judge</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint filed against Prince Asiel Ben Israel and C. Gregory Turner stated that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2013/pr0806_01.html">men attempted to persuade</a> [press release] US state and federal lawmakers to oppose sanctions against Zimbabwe leaders in exchange for USD $3.4 million. Defendants were charged with violating the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA) [text, PDF], which <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/us-charges-2-lobbying-zimbabwes-mugabe-224406209.html">carries a maximum penalty</a> [AP report] of 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The investigation against US lawmakers is ongoing, but none of the government officials who met with Israel and Turner has been accused of wrongdoing at this time.  

<p>The sanctions against Mugabe and other designated individuals in Zimbabwe were initially imposed in 2003 by then-president George W. Bush in response to human rights violations, especially surrounding the diamond trade, occurring in the country. In May of last year a South African court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/south-africa-court-orders-probe-into-zimbabwe-rights-violation.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged human rights violations committed by Mugabe's government. The court order came after <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-urges-south-africa-to-prosecute-zimbabwe-crimes-against-humanity.php">legal action was brought by human rights groups</a> [JURIST report] urging South African courts to prosecute Mugabe's government for crimes against humanity. In 2011 the BBC reported that Zimbabwe security forces have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">running illegal diamond mining camps</a> [JURIST report] in the country's Marange area, where recruited civilian workers are regularly tortured and forced into labor. According to the report, workers are subject to mauling by dogs, multiple beatings and rape. The camps, one of which allegedly has ties to a personal friend of Mugabe, were reported to have been operating for three years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires that meetings of a political nature held between three or more people be authorized by the police and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uganda-passes-law-public-protests-19881241">allows police to use force</a> [AP report] in order to break up gatherings being held without prior approval. The new legislation comes in the wake of an increased number of protests against <a href="http://www.statehouse.go.ug/president">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [official website], who has been in power for almost 30 years. Activists who attempted to challenge the legislation argue that the new law violates the Ugandan constitution, which allows for citizens to hold peaceful gatherings. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/uganda-public-management-order-bill-serious-blow-open-political-debate-2013">called the legislation</a> [press release] "a serious blow to open political debate," and AI deputy Africa director Sarah Jackson stated, "Prohibitions on open political discussion and peaceful demonstration are alarming and utterly impermissible under international law."

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda">Uganda</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn much international criticism in recent years regarding alleged human rights violations and treatment of those who are deemed to be government opposition. In August of last year <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-uganda-authorities-threatening-rights-groups.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the government of Uganda was harassing and intimidating rights groups and other non-government organizations (NGOs). Earlier in June Uganda's government <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-government-banning-organizations-for-promoting-gay-rights.php">banned 38 NGOs accused of promoting gay rights</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-violence-against-children-continues-un.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) opposition group still poses a threat to children in Uganda. In May 2011 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-uganda-government-for-protest-response.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Uganda's government to stop using what she called excessive force against protesters in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court confirmed former prime minister <a href="http://www.ibk2013.com/BIOGRAPHIE.html">Ibrahim Boubacar Keita</a> [official profile] as the winner of Mali's July 28 first round presidential vote but said that he had failed to win an outright majority, only securing 39.79 percent of the vote. Former finance minister Soumaila Cisse was the runner-up with 19.7 percent of the vote. Cisse and other candidates had accused Keita's campaign of at least a dozen instances of electoral fraud. Keita will face Cisse in the second round of voting on Sunday. 

<p>Keita is considered the frontrunner in Sunday's election, having secured the endorsement of some 20 other candidates as well as influential Muslim leaders. He has run a nationalist campaign, promising to restore Mali's dignity after a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/mali-soldiers-take-control-of-government-suspend-constitution.php">March 2012 coup</a> [JURIST report] threw the country into civil war. Cisse has criticized religious leaders for publicly backing Keita as Malian electoral law forbids "people of influence" from advancing political candidates. Whoever wins Sunday's election will have to negotiate with the Tuaregs, who <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-04-02/news/31275676_1_mali-coup-leader-bamako-tuareg-rebels">took advantage of the chaos surrounding the coup</a> [AP report]. The Tuaregs have currently agreed to a ceasefire with the government.<br />

The budget and fees for the program totaled over $130 million. This order comes as the FBI esearches allegations by BP that the disbursement process has been corrupted. Although Shushan acknowledged that BP raised legitimate concerns about claims administrators approving false filings for a percentage of the payouts, she concluded that the program could not be halted on short notice based on the allegations alone. Although BP appealed immediately, US District Judge Carl Barbier, who is overseeing the spill litigation, upheld the decision within hours. The claim administration program is expected to continue operations while the court-appointed administrator and several former employees are <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/birmingham/press-releases/2013/three-charged-in-scheme-to-defraud-bp-oil-spill-claims-fund">investigated for fraud</a> [FBI summary]. 

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gulf+oil+spill">2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the largest commercial disasters in modern history, and was responsible for the destruction of protected wildlife habitats that are still under reconstruction to this day. Two weeks ago, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that<a href="http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/default.page"> Halliburton Energy Services</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=halliburton">news archive</a>] agreed to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/July/13-crm-850.html">plead guilty to destroying evidence</a> [press release] in connection with the spill. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between BP and the DOJ for the company's criminal liability in the spill. Earlier in January <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Ltd.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act </a>(CWA) [EPA summary] and agreed to pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontitalyrepublic.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Italian Senate on Thursday approved a measure to ease some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe by cutting pre-trial detentions and using alternative punishments for minor offenses. In January the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ordered Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/eu-court-rules-italy-prison-overcrowding-violates-rights.php">address the problem</a> [JURIST report] within a year, <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115860#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-115860%22]}">ruling</a> [judgment, in French] that overcrowding had violated the rights of seven inmates who brought a test case. Italian jails are the most crowded in the EU, with close to 67,000 detainees held in jails built for 45,000, and some prisons at over 250 percent of capacity, according to prison rights group Antigone. Chronic overcrowding, which the government declared an emergency in 2010, may be caused by Italy's slower paced justice system and a failure to build new prison cells during a deep economic recession. The measure will make pre-trial detention only applicable in exceptional cases for crimes punishable by less than five years in jail. It also opens up a community service alternative to jail time to repeat offenders, though not in the case of crimes such as mafia association, stalking and child abuse.

<p>Prison overcrowding is a common problem across the globe. Last August the Colombia Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/colombia-transfers-inmates-to-solve-prison-overcrowding-problem.php">announced a new initiative</a> [JURIST report] to solve the problem of overcrowding in the nation's prisons. In June UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/DeputyHighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-official-urges-malawi-to-improve-human-rights-conditions-accountability.php">urged the government of Malawi</a> [JURIST report] to address the problem of prison overcrowding and improve the human rights condition in the country. That month Burundi announced that it would also <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/burundi-releases-prisoners-to-address-overcrowded-prisons.php">release prisoners to solve overcrowding problems</a> [JURIST report]. Last April South Africa announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/south-africa-president-pardons-35000-offenders-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">issue pardons</a> [JURIST report] to 35,000 offenders in order to ease prison overcrowding. Last February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/hrw-calls-for-reduction-of-latin-america-prison-population.php">called for the reduction of overcrowding</a> [JURIST report] to improve poor prison conditions in Latin America following a prison fire in Honduras, which killed more than 300 inmates and injured dozens more. In August 2011 Venezuela announced its <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/venezuela-to-release-40-percent-of-prisoners-to-reduce-overcrowding.php">plan to reduce its prison population</a> [JURIST report] by 40 percent. A controversial clemency law introduced in Italy that reduced some prison sentences by three years to cut down on jail overcrowding <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/new-italy-law-cutting-prison-time.php">faced criticism</a> [JURIST report] in August 2006 after some released prisoners returned to lives of crime. Prisons in the US are facing similar problems. In May 2011 the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v. Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>] to uphold an order requiring California to release up to 46,000 prisoners to address the problem of prison overcrowding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the court held that the ITC applied an inappropriate standard of review when it invalidated one Apple patent regarding touch screen technology and found that Google's Motorola Mobility did not violate a similar patent. The court thus affirmed the <a href="http://www.finnegan.com/files/Publication/bce42cab-ebc0-4fcd-8852-eaeb0939079e/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/b89d9568-5b8d-4bcb-a6e1-eafd09691bc7/12-1338%208-7-13.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part. The court returned the issues to the ITC with instructions to apply different legal standards. The court's in-depth analysis of the creation history of both systems relied heavily on the issues of "obviousness" of the evolutionary path of technology. A date for the renewed ITC proceedings has not yet been set. 

<p>Apple has also been involved in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] that spans over four continents. The two companies have been engaged in patent litigation since 2010, each filing lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. Last week the Obama administration <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/AppleLetter.PDF">overturned</a> [official text, PDF] a US trade panel ban on the sale of older iPads and iPhones. In June the Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-suit.php">ruled for Apple</a> [JURIST report] in a patent infringement suit. Similarly in March a UK court also ruled for Apple <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">permitting continued use of technology</a> [JURIST report] that allows transfers of information over the third-generation networks that are used by smartphones. In January a Dutch court ruled that the designs of some Galaxy Tab models produced by Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/dutch-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">do not infringe designs patented by Apple</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/thai-lawmakers-give-initial-approval-for-divisive-bill-granting-amnesty-to-political-offenders/2013/08/08/29fc699c-002b-11e3-8294-0ee5075b840d_story.html">approved</a> [WP report] by a vote of 300-124 despite <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/us-thailand-politics-idUSBRE97606F20130807">protests</a> [Reuters report] by members of the opposition party who fear that the bill will allow former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile] to return to Thailand without facing prison. While the bill explicitly excludes Thaksin, opponents are concerned that the law is an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thai-lawmakers-start-debate-amnesty-bill-19889706">underhanded attempt</a> [AP report] to allow him back into the country.  However, before ultimately becoming law the bill must be approved by a 35-person parliamentary committee and signed by the king and must also withstand any legal challenges.

<p>Thailand has faced significant political instability since the 2006 coup that ousted Thaksin. In December of last year Thailand announced that former prime minister Abhist Vejjajiva would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-thailiands-department-of-special.php">charged with murder</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1990184,00.html">2010 military crackdown</a> [TIME backgrounder] on anti-government protests that left more than 90 killed and 1,800 injured. In October the Thai Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/arrest-warrant-issued-for-thailand-ex-pm.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Thaksin after he refused to appear before the court to stand trial for criminal charges.

Capriles lost narrowly to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20664349">Nicolas Maduro</a> [BBC profile] in Venezuela's presidential election, which took place following the death of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10086210">Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">news archive</a>]. Maduro was the hand picked successor of Chavez while Capriles challenged Chavez for the presidency in 2012. The court dismissed Capriles' <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-venezuela-supreme-court-election-lawsuit-20130807,0,5300988.story">allegations of "voter irregularities"</a> [LAT report] and assessed him with a USD $1,500 fine for "offensive and disrespectful allegations."

<p>Chavez was a controversial figure in the region during his 14 years as Venezuela's president, and Maduro is expected to continue many of his policies. In January, months before Chavez died, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-venezuela-should-end-censorship-media-intimidation.php">called upon Venezuela</a> [JURIST report] to end its practice of censoring and intimidating members of the media that challenge Chavez. In July 2012 Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/venezuela-withdraws-from-human-rights-court.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Venezuela would withdraw from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). The announcement came after the IACHR concluded Venezuela violated the rights of a convicted bomber by subjecting him to <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-24/news/sns-rt-us-venezuela-oasbre86o03m-20120724_1_countries-with-weak-judiciaries-history-of-authoritarian-leaders-human-rights">deplorable prison conditions</a> [Reuters report]. In 2011 Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/venezuela-president-criticizes-human-rights-court-ruling.php">criticized the IACHR</a> [JURIST report] for ruling in favor of presidential hopeful Leopold Lopez allowing him to run for office, despite an earlier ruling baring his candidacy. In June 2010 the IACHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-commission-concerned-over-freedom-of-expression-in-venezuela.php?goback=.nvr_3014631_2">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the Venezuelan government expressing concern over the increasing threat to freedom of expression in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the law forbids pharmacists from dispensing emergency contraceptives to women younger than 17 unless they have a prescription. Pharmacists may still provide emergency contraceptives to women 17 and older without a prescription. The OCRJ <a href="http://ocrj.org/content/ocrj-joins-new-legal-challenge-oklahoma-law-restricting-emergency-contraception">argues</a> [press release] that the law clearly violates the Oklahoma Constitution
s <a href="http://oklegal.onenet.net/okcon/V-57.html">"single-subject rule"</a> [text], which provides that all laws passed by Oklahoma's legislature may only "embrace" one subject, which should be clearly expressed in its title. HB 2226 <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB2226">began</a> [legislative materials] as a bill concerned with regulating health insurance benefit forms, but the emergency contraception language was added in May shortly before it was signed into law.

<p>The lawsuit is the latest challenge to reproductive rights-related legislation adopted in Oklahoma. In July JURIST Guest Columnist Adam Banner <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/adam-banner-bill-1970.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] an order by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] for the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-issues-final-orders-of-term.php">clarify</a> its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110765.html">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice v.

In May JPMorgan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/08/us-jpmorgan-probes-idUSBRE97617T20130808">received notice</a> [Reuters report] that the EDC's civil division had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws by offering subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during 2005 to 2007. JPMorgan also said the US <a href="http://www.occ.gov/">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a> [official website] has said it intends to seek an administrative order over how it had handled collections of consumer credit card debt.

<p>JPMorgan's disclosures came one day after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-sues-bank-of-america-for-fraud-relating-to-financial-crisis.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website], claiming the corporation misled investors about securitized loans worth more than $850 million. In an announcement earlier that week, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-ag-886.html">remarked</a> [press release] that the suit against BOA prove that the <a href="http://www.stopfraud.gov/">Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force</a> [official website] is taking an aggressive approach to uncovering abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. The announcement comes after years of criticism by homeowners, investors and politicians that federal and state investigators have failed to bring criminal charges against high-level executives over lending and securitization activities that contributed to the housing and financial crises. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Obama administration is supporting the petitioner in the upcoming case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-greece-v-galloway/">Town of Greece v. Galloway</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. The town of Greece has argued that using public, participatory prayers to begin a town hall meeting does not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">Establishment Clause of the First Amendment</a> [text]. The Obama administration distinguished their argument in support of the town by pushing the court to consider the history of public prayers to open federal congressional sessions. Using that tradition as a framework, it argues that government can encourage public meetings to seek "divine guidance" and "solemnity" in public affairs by inviting a spiritual leader to open the public session in prayer. Relying on the endorsement test, however, the solicitor general argued that once the prayer is opened, the personal contributions of public officials may not direct the prayer in a way that would associate official government entities with creation of a public forum for religion, especially not one that is associated with a specific religion. As for censoring the content of those individuals' personal prayers, the solicitor general argued, "Neither courts nor legislative bodies are well suited to police the sectarian content of prayers." A date for the arguments has not yet been set.

<p>The Supreme Court agreed in May to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-adds-5-cases-to-next-years-docket.php">rule in the case</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit </a>[official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/951fd6be-4f98-435e-b27f-869e99b37192/1/doc/10-3635_opn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in May of last year that beginning the town's meeting with prayer is an <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/second-circuit-rules-against-town-council-led-prayer.php">unconstitutional endorsement of religion</a> [JURIST report]. Town board meetings in <a href="http://greeceny.gov/">Greece, New York</a> [official website] were admittedly led with prayer, typically Christian-based, although the town maintained that any faith was welcome to lead the council in prayer. Due to this stipulation, the plaintiffs alleged that this practice violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and received a summary judgment dismissal in district court. The Second Circuit overturned that judgment and ruled that while prayer may not be disallowed at the meetings, the current standards reflected a Christian viewpoint. The ruling further suggested that government entities have "an obligation to consider how its prayer practice would be perceived by those who attended Town Board meetings." The court also made clear that they were not ruling against any form of prayer during the meetings, nor even nonsectarian ones, but that any prayer or invocation must be distanced to not be perceived as a government endorsement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wisconsin-officials-appeal-abortion-law-injunction.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/13cv465_Injunction.pdf"> injunction</a> [text, PDF] earlier this week. The law requires medical providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. It was <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/Wisconsin/lawsuit-sb206-41584.htm">challenged</a> [press release] by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/Wisconsin/">Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin</a> [advocacy website] on the grounds that it would require two major providers facilities to close due to limited geographical access to hospitals. Judge Willam Conley <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-blocks-wisconsin-abortion-law.php">blocked the law</a> [JURIST report] until its constitutionality could be decided. With this interlocutory appeal, Conley has agreed to temporarily stay all further proceedings pending the decision, but has invited the opposing party to respond as to whether the proceedings must continue at this point. The injunction still remains in effect.

<p>A number of states have recently passed laws relating to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=reproductive+rights">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In July Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed abortion restrictions into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring women to first undergo ultrasounds. In April North Dakota Governor <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/">Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] signed a measure banning abortions after <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">20 weeks gestation</a> [JURIST report] based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF], which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act </a>[Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation."

In July 2011 the country decided to stop using firing squads in favor of lethal injections, but was unable to procure the necessary drugs largely due to EU export restrictions. In May it amended the law to allow locally-produced chemicals to be used. State media officials said on Tuesday that the country executed its first prisoner&#8212;a 27-year old convicted murderer&#8212;by lethal injection. OHCHR spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly stated:<blockquote>We are dismayed by the resumption of the death penalty by Vietnam. Some 18 months after the last execution is reported to have taken place, this resumption represents a major setback in Vietnam's human rights record. We are also deeply concerned at some 116 death row prisoners who have exhausted their appeals and face imminent execution.</blockquote>Pouilly urged the Vietnam government not to carry out further executions and to join the growing number of UN member states that have established a moratorium on the death penalty, or abolished this practice altogether, including 19 states in the Asia-Pacific region. 

<p>Application of the death penalty has remained a controversial issue around the globe, and the UN in particular has fought to abolish it for years. In March the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions Christof Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-restrict-use-of-death-penalty.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to restrict the use of capital punishment to comply with international human rights obligations. Also in March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-executions-in-saudi-arabia.php">condemned</a> [JURIST] the executions of seven people in Saudi Arabia as a violation of international safeguards on the use of the death penalty. The men were executed by firing squad after convictions for theft, looting and armed robbery. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reiterated his call for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-chief-calls-for-abolition-of-death-penalty.php">global support against the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], stressing that its application is inconsistent with the most fundamental human right principle: the right to life. A moratorium on the death penalty was first <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the UN General Assembly in 2007 and, as of December 2012, has gained the support of 111 countries, with 41 against and 34 neither supporting nor opposing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On July 30 unknown assailants shot and killed Richard Kho, 47, and Bonifacio Loreto Jr., 59, both columnists for the weekly tabloid <em>Aksyon Ngayon</em>, in Quezon City, Metro Manila. Two days later, on August 1, unidentified gunmen killed a freelance photojournalist, Mario Sy, 53, in the southern city of General Santos. Police have not made any arrests in the killings. HRW said:<blockquote>The latest killings and threats against journalists underscore the precarious state of media freedom in the Philippines and the need for the government to respond. Unless the government brings people who attack journalists to justice, these killings are not going to stop. The Philippines has a reputation for having one of the freest media freedom environments in Asia, but that reputation disappears bit-by-bit with every killing of a journalist.</blockquote>HRW further noted that "while the killers and motives are unknown, these and past unresolved attacks on journalists have a chilling effect on media freedom in the country."

<p>Journalism has long been a high-risk profession in the Philippines. According to the <a href="http://www.cpj.org">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website], some 73 journalists have been murdered in the Philippines since 1992, and local media groups put the number considerably higher. The Philippines consistently ranks as among the top three in the organization's list of "deadliest countries" for journalists. The <a href="http://www.nujp.org">National Union of Journalists of the Philippines</a> (NUJP) [advocacy website] said that the three recent killings brought the number of journalists killed in the country under the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph">Aquino</a> [official website] administration to 18. Journalists, particularly outside the major cities, regularly report threats and harassment. The union said that most of the journalists killed had received death threats. The Aquino administration has announced reforms to the criminal justice system that could result in more effective criminal investigations, but has not fully implemented them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The next step will allow adversary to challenge the government's position in judicial review process of the FISC balancing security and privacy concerns. Third, President Obama stated that he directed the intelligence community to make public as many documents as possible and to "release information that details its mission, authorities and oversight." Lastly, a group of outside experts will be formed that will review the current intelligence and communications technologies. On the same day, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/Section215.pdf">white paper</a> [text, PDF] explaining the legal rationale behind Section 215.

<p>Revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism.php">US government surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked debate and controversy since the leak of confidential documents in June by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive].

During the same month, the FISC permitted Yahoo to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/yahoo-allowed-to-disclose-nsa-data-requests-fisc.php">declassify a redacted 2008 order</a> [JURIST report] that the company comply with the <a href="/feature/2013/07/fisa.php">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [JURIST feature] in data collection. <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Civil liberties groups</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">Google and Microsoft</a> [JURIST reports] have directly challenged the court to declassify data collected under its orders.

The two patents involves the detection of users' finger movements on smartphone touchscreens and the way its plugs detect when other devices have been plugged in. The ITC, however, rejected four other patent infringement claims against Samsung. With the recent determination of infringement, the court issued a limited cease and desist order that would ban further imports, sales and distribution of Samsung's infringing products. President <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a> [official website] has now 60 days to invalidate the order.

<p>Apple has been involved in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. The two companies have been engaged in patent litigation since 2010, each filing lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. Earlier this month, the Obama administration <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/AppleLetter.PDF">overturned</a> [official text, PDF] a US trade panel ban on the sale of older iPads and iPhones.

Despite Apple's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/09/ny-judge-denies-apple-request-e-books-case/2636679/">continued denial</a> [AP report] of the charges, US District Judge Denise Cote emphasized the need to suppress such collusive activity. Cote singled out Apple as a <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/08/09/net-us-apple-ebooks-idINBRE9710OC20130809">central force</a> [Reuters report] in the entire price-fixing operation, portraying a company known so well for its image-minded marketing and business model as a disreputable market participant. 

<p>In May Judge Cote gave a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-believes-doj-will-prevail-in-apple-antitrust-case.php">tentative opinion</a> [JURST report] that the government would be successful in its antitrust claim. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] alleged that Apple, Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Macmillan and Penguin Group (USA) Inc. conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April 2012, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May of last year. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">merely "superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books at a loss in order to drive the sale of Kindles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Known as the Public Order Management Bill, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/uganda-legislature-passes-law-restricting-public-meetings.php">passed on Tuesday</a> [JURIST report], Uganda now <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45593&Cr=freedom%20of%20association&Cr1=#.UgaVwWT71cQ">prohibits protests</a> [UN press release] of more than three people without prior police authorization. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersindex.aspx">Margaret Sekaggya</a> [official website], expressed her disapproval of the law, claiming its purpose is directly aimed at suppressing the freedom of assembly. The UN has asked Uganda to reform its legal code to conform with international human rights obligations. In addition to the public assembly restrictions, the law also permits security forces to <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/08/09/Uganda-restricts-public-demonstrations/UPI-30111376063096/?spt=hs&or=tn">use weapons when patrolling public events</a> [UPI report]. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda">Uganda</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn much international criticism in recent years regarding alleged human rights violations and treatment of those who are deemed to be government opposition. In August of last year <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-uganda-authorities-threatening-rights-groups.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the government of Uganda was harassing and intimidating rights groups and other non-government organizations (NGOs). Earlier in June Uganda's government <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-government-banning-organizations-for-promoting-gay-rights.php">banned 38 NGOs accused of promoting gay rights</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-violence-against-children-continues-un.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) opposition group still poses a threat to children in Uganda. In May 2011 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-uganda-government-for-protest-response.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Uganda's government to stop using what she called excessive force against protesters in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Islamic State of Iraq</a> [Global Security profile], a suspected al Qaeda branch, had committed crimes against humanity during the July 29 bombings in Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/iraq-al-qaida-claims-prison-raids">claimed responsibility</a> [AP report] for a series of car bombs implemented to aid a prison raid. The July 29 bombings killed over 60 people, and July was the bloodiest month in Iraq in over five years according to the <a href="http://unami.unmissions.org/">United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq</a> (UNAMI) [official website]  <a href="http://unami.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=2854&ctl=Details&mid=5170&ItemID=1739589&language=en-US">estimates</a> [text].

The Islamic State of Iraq stated that the bombings served as retaliation for government security forces' attack on a Sunni protest camp in Hawija. 

<p>The human rights situation in Iraq remains fragile. In June, UNAMI released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-urges-iraq-to-address-growing-trend-of-human-rights-abuses.php">report</a> [JURIST report] which urged Iraqi leaders to develop measures addressing the growing trend of human rights abuses in Iraq. In July 2012 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-recent-coordinated-attacks-across-iraq.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a coordinated string of bombings and shootings in 13 cities, including Baghdad, that killed at least 91 people and injured nearly 200 more. In May 2012 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/iraq-human-rights-situation-still-fragile-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the human rights situation in Iraq continued to struggle during the nation's transition from a decade-long dictatorship to a peaceful democratic system. UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iraq-human-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011 that human rights abuses continued to plague various regions of Iraq.

Tension and political divisiveness in Egypt has continued following  the military's <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">ouster</a> [JURIST report] of former President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [official BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morsi">news archive</a>]. The statement said: "The Secretary-General's immediate concern is for the leaders of Egypt, on all sides, to exercise their leadership and their responsibility to do whatever can be done to prevent further loss of life among the Egyptian people." The UN SG expressed confidence that if violent means can be avoided, Egypt will reach a successful resolution.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked recently in the wake of new developments. Earlier this month, amid escalating unrest in Cairo, the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/unicef-voices-concern-for-egypt-children-in-recent-violence.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that children were being used as symbolic witnesses and subjected to violence in the recent unrest. Last month, both Ban and the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] engaged the current leadership in discussions about protecting human rights and the UN urged the Egyptian government to ensure the application of law and order in dealing with protesters. The country's interim government also caused controversy earlier in July when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down</a> [JURIST report] four Islamist-run television stations that it viewed as sympathetic to ousted president Mohammed Morsi and his supporters. The country's government is currently being headed by the Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile], who took the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state days after the Egyptian military deposed Morsi and suspended the nation's constitution in early July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdul Aziz Moussa is representing Mohamed Hassan, who acted as a media contact point for various foreign news stories, which included coverage of anti-government protests and police crackdowns in Bahrain. Hassan was taken from his home in July by men associated with the <a href="http://www.interior.gov.bh/default_en.aspx">Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] and detained incommunicado at the Criminal Investigation Department. Moussa was detained on August 8 after he reported on Twitter the visible signs of torture he had seen on his client Hassan. Front Line Defenders considers that the arrest and detention of Hassan and Moussa to be directly related to their activities in defense of human rights.

<p>Bahrain has imprisoned numerous activists in the wake of the 2011 protests and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banned all protests</a> [JURIST report] effective October 2012.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontnypd.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=316">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/home.shtml">New York Police Department</a> (NYPD) [official website] stop-and-frisk policy violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text]. The use of the "stop-and-frisk" tactic was popularized during the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] administration, and over the past decade the city has conducted about 5 million stop and frisks. The vast majority of residents who have been stopped, more than 80 percent, have been black or Latino. Judge Shira Scheindlin noted that "[a] lot of people are being frisked or searched on suspicion of having a gun and nobody has a gun. Only 0.14 percent of stops have led to police finding guns. So the point is suspicion turns out to be wrong in most cases." Scheindlin further reasoned:<blockquote>The City acted with deliberate indifference toward the NYPD's practice of making unconstitutional stops and conducting unconstitutional frisks. Even if the City had not been deliberately indifferent, the NYPD's unconstitutional practices were sufficiently widespread as to have the force of law. In addition, the City adopted a policy of indirect racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups for stops based on local crime suspect data. This has resulted in the disproportionate and discriminatory stopping of blacks and Hispanics in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. ... I also conclude that the City's highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner. In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting 'the right people' is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the US Constitution.</blockquote>In spite of ongoing litigation and political pressure, Bloomberg and <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/headquarters_co.shtml">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly</a> [official profile] have defended the practice, crediting it with helping to drive down crime numbers, especially homicides, to historic lows. The Bloomberg administration also asserted that rather than profiling people of color in the city, the practice has saved the lives of minorities who are most often the victims of violent  crime.

<p>In January Scheindlin <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-1.php">lifted an order</a> [JURIST report] that previously required the NYPD to stop using its "stop-and-frisk" practice. There, the judge reasoned that complying with the former order would place an undue burden on the NYPD to train thousands of officers and their supervisors. Two weeks prior Scheindlin declared the "stop-and-frisk" policy <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-declares-nypd-stop-and-frish-policy-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] on grounds that it violates the protection against unreasonable search and seizures of the Fourth Amendment. She reasoned that officers were not first meeting their requirement of developing a reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk supposed trespassers. Scheindlin's original decision was the first federal ruling to find that the "stop-and-frisk" practice is unconstitutional, though the NYPD has recently received a great deal of scrutiny for various allegations of misconduct. In July of last year a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the NYPD used excessive force and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. In May, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution. In March, NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">fervently denied</a> [press release] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Spain contends that the border checks are proportional and necessary to prevent money laundering and smuggling. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23617910">Gibraltar</a> [BBC backgrounder], a British overseas territory located off Spain's southern coast, has long been a point of contention between the UK and Spain, and the recent border crackdown has resulted in longer delays and higher fees for tourists.

Csatary <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23664226">died in a Hungarian hospital</a> [BBC report] while awaiting trial, which was set to begin in September. Csatary was apprehended in Budapest in July 2012 and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/92-year-old-former-nazi-to-stand-trial-in-germany.php">charged this June</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest. The arrest came after the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish human rights organization committed to finding and prosecuting Holocaust war criminals, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-allegedly-in-hungary.php">submitted new evidence</a> [JURIST report] to the Budapest prosecutor's office detailing the war crimes allegedly committed by Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary, a former senior Hungarian police officer in the Slovakian city of Kosice. The evidence submitted indicates Csatary aided in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> [JURIST news archive], and that Csatary was one of the main actors responsible for deporting 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamenetz-Podolsk in Ukraine, where they were killed in 1941. A court in Czechoslovakia sentenced Csatary to death <em>in absentia</em> in 1948, but the country subsequently abolished the death penalty before dividing into Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In March a Slovakian court altered Csatary's sentence to life imprisonment. 

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to arrest individuals charged with war crimes during the Holocaust. Last month a German state court announced that it will require 92-year-old Siert Bruins, a former member of the Nazi <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007405">Waffen SS</a> [USHMM backgrounder], to go on trial in September after Bruins was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-nazi-for-1944-killing.php">charged for the murder</a> [JURIST report] of resistance fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in 1944. In May German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp. German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the Holocaust.

Holder outlined additional reforms as part of his new <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/SMARTONCRIME.pdf">"Smart on Crime" plan</a> [text, PDF] during his <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2013/ag-speech-130812.html">speech</a> [text] to the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> [official website] on Monday. With federal sequestration imposing severe cuts, Holder states that federal prosecutors cannot, and should not, charge every defendant accused of violating federal law. In the memorandum detailing the policy change, Holder stated:<blockquote>We must ensure that our most severe mandatory minimum penalties are reserved for serious, high-level, or violent drug traffickers. In some cases, mandatory minimum and recidivist enhancement statutes have resulted in unduly harsh sentences and perceived or actual disparities that do not reflect our Principles of Federal Prosecution. Long sentences for low-level, non-violent drug offenses do not promote public safety, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Moreover, rising prison costs have resulted in reduced spending on criminal justice initiatives, including spending on law enforcement agents, prosecutors, and prevention and intervention programs. These reductions in public safety spending require us to make our public safety expenditures smarter and more productive.</blockquote>Holder has also called for greater use of alternatives to incarceration and renewed focus on prevention, stating that "while the aggressive enforcement of federal criminal statutes remains necessary, we cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation."

<p>The "war on drugs" is a campaign of prohibition undertaken by the US government and other participating countries to reduce the production, distribution, and consumption of illegal drugs. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/56924096?access_key=key-xoixompyejnky70a9mq">report</a> [PDF] critique of the war on drugs, declaring "the global war on drugs has failed." In May 2012 the US government published an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy">updated drug policy</a> [text], and has described the policy as an alternative to the war on drugs, where success is not measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built. That same month, representatives of Italy, Russia, Sweden, the UK, and the US met in Stockholm to sign a <a href="http://www.wfad.se/images/articles/Final_statement_WFAD.pdf">joint statement</a> [text, PDF] in support of a balanced approach combining effective enforcement restricting drugs supplies with efforts to reduce demand and build recovery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kostroma Center was fined 300,000 rubles (USD $9,000) for organizing a roundtable with US diplomats, which investigators said counted as "political activity." The Center filed the complaint after the Sverdlovsk regional court upheld the fines. Critics of <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">news archive</a>] say the new law is aimed at discrediting organizations that have spoken out against Russia's leader and have helped provide support to the biggest protest movement against his nearly 13-year rule. Russian lawyer Ramil Akhmetgaliev said that the law violates at least five articles of the Russian Constitution, and "forces people and organizations to give up their beliefs and violates the equality of citizens' rights regardless of their belonging to this or that organizations and the right to participate in managing state affairs." Kostroma Center has since elected to close and operate as an unregistered public movement. Human rights activists hope that the court's decision will also explain the term "political activity" because they say almost any NGO may be subject to prosecution given a loose interpretation.

<p>Russia's <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/en/">Federal Council</a> [official website], the upper house of parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">approved the law</a> [JURIST report] last July much to the dismay of Putin's critics, who consider the bill an effort to <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/russian-federation-council-approves-foreign-agent-ngo-bill/24649114.html">curb free speech</a> [RFE/RL report] and the right to assemble. Since the NGO law <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-activists-to-appeal-ngo-law-to-europe-rights-court.php">took effect last November</a> [JURIST report], Russian activists have vowed to challenge it. Leading rights groups, including <a href="http://www.memo.ru/eng/">Memorial</a> [official website], election-monitoring body <a href="http://golos.org">Golos</a> [official website, in Russian] and the <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/english/18E49C2">Moscow Helsinki Group</a> [official website] have all chosen to appeal to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/us-russia-putin-ngos-idUSBRE86K05M20120721">claimed</a> [Reuters report] it had "deep concern" about the new bill, but was likewise reminded by Moscow that such an issue involves domestic rather than international policy. In April 2013, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/russia0413_ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] analyzing the law and calling for its repeal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Montgomery County court clerk D. Bruce Hanes issued 116 marriage licenses to same-sex couples after <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/theoffice.aspx?id=6794">Attorney General Kathleen Kane</a> [official website] said the Pennsylvania Marriage Law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report]. The Corbett administration argues that Hanes' actions have interfered with the uniform administration of the law. The administration further argues that Hanes has a duty to follow a 1996 state law, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman:<blockquote>There is no limit to the administrative and legal chaos that is likely to flow from the clerk's unlawful practice. Ours is a government of laws, not one of public officials exercising their will as they believe the law should be or will be ... only courts can declare a law unconstitutional and suspend it.</blockquote>The administration wants a judge to order Hanes to immediately cease issuing licenses to same-sex couples and argued that if a law directs government officials to do something, they cannot disregard that direction simply because they believe it to be unconstitutional and argued that county officials who flout the law "may be guilty of a misdemeanor for each act of neglect or refusal."

<p>In July the Pennsylvania Department of Health <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pa-doh-suing-county-clerk-for-issuing-marriage-licenses-to-same-sex-couples.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court/">Commonwealth Court</a> [official website] seeking to stop Hanes from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Also in July the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania. The <a href="http://www.ogc.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/office_of_general_counsel_-_home/1198">Governor's Office of General Counsel</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.philly.com/documents/Ltr+to+Adrian+King+%28Whitewood%29+07-30-13%5B2%5D.pdf">wrote</a> [text, PDF] to the attorney general in defense of the Pennsylvania statute, arguing that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> does not strike down the state's marriage law, but just the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">Windsor</a> [opinion, PDF] ruling, <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">courts across the country have been citing the decision</a> [JURIST news archive]. In Michigan a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-blocks-michigans-ban-on-domestic-partner-benefits.php">blocked the state's ban</a> [JURIST report] on domestic partner benefits for employees who work for public schools or local governments. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of two men seeking recognition of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. Ohio law prohibits same-sex marriage but recognizes marriages solemnized outside of the state. James Obergefell and his partner, John Arthur, who suffers from a terminal illness, married legally in Maryland earlier this month and returned to Ohio where they have resided for nearly 20 years. Arthur sought to include Obergefell as his surviving spouse on his death certificate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law will effectively <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57598224/lawsuit-hits-n.c-as-soon-as-voter-id-bill-approved/">roll back the early voting period</a> [CBS report] and repeal one-stop registration during early voting. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/">North Carolina General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-voter-id-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month, despite criticism from Democrats who argued that the legislation would have the effect of disenfranchising many voters. Various civil rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites], filed lawsuits on Monday almost immediately after the controversial bill was signed into law. McCrory, however, stands in strong support of the law, stating, "Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed require photo ID and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote." The new law is set to take effect in 2016 and will allow only an in-state state driver's license, US passport or military ID as acceptable forms of ID. 

<p>North Carolina is the first state to make changes to its voting laws after June's US Supreme Court ruling, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Section 5 of the VRA requires that jurisdictions with a history of preventing minority groups from voting receive preclearance from the US Department of Justice or a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia before they may be permitted to make any changes to their voting laws. Section 4 provided a formula for determining which jurisdictions are covered under section 5. North Carolina had previously been subject to section 5 preclearance requirements. More than 30 US states have passed some version of <a href="/feature/2013/07/voter-id-laws.php">voter ID law</a> [JURIST backgrounder], including 17 that require a photo ID.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law will have the effect of granting transgender students the ability to choose whether to use the boy's or girl's bathroom at school and whether to join a boy's or girl's sports team. California is the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57598231/california-law-allows-transgender-students-to-pick-bathrooms-sports-teams-they-identify-with/">first state in the US</a> [AP report] to incorporate protections for transgender students into its laws. While opponents of the bill argue that allowing transgender students to choose which facilities to use <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/05/09/assembly-bill-would-allow-transgender-students-to-use-facilities-they-identify-with/">violates the privacy rights</a> [CBS report] of other students, supporters feel the protections are necessary to reduce bullying and discrimination. 

<p>Rights for transgender individuals remains a contentious issue throughout the world. Last month the US <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-agency-decision-extends-title-vii-protection-to-transgender-workers.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a transgender woman who endured physical and verbal harassment during her employment as a federal contractor in Maryland. In May a number of human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/cameroon-authorities-urged-to-drop-charges-against-transgendered-youths.php">urged Cameroon to drop charges</a> [JURIST report] against two transgender youths who were arrested for engaging in homosexual conduct. Earlier that month, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hong-kong-high-court-rules-transgender-woman-can-marry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting a transgender woman from marrying her boyfriend was invalid under the Chinese constitution. In March Canadian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/canada-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-transgender-discrimination.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would outlaw discrimination against transgender individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling arose from a criminal case involving a defendant convicted of murder who appealed his conviction in part because the district court dismissed a prospective juror who was Spanish-speaking and had difficulty understanding English. While the Supreme Court noted that the juror's dismissal violated Article VII, Section 3 of the New Mexico Constitution, the conviction cannot be reversed because the defendant's attorney failed to object during trial. Monday's ruling signals to judges and lawyers in New Mexico that they must make an effort to <a href="http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2013/08/13/new-mexico-court-rules-non-english-speaking-citizens-can-serve-on-juries/">protect the rights of non-English speaking citizens</a> [AP report] to serve on juries. 

<p>The rights of non-English speaking citizens in the US has been a contentious issue in recent years. In March the Texas House of Representatives introduced a <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/billtext/pdf/HB00986I.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [text, PDF] to limit the availability of non-English voting ballots. Last year the state of Alaska <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/alaska-files-lawsuit-challenging-voting-rights-act.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Attorney General Eric holder over being subjected to preclearence because it discriminated against Native American citizens by providing English-only ballot materials. The preclearence formula of the Voting Rights Act was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court in June. In 2011 16 counties in Colorado <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_18839708">printed English-only election ballots</a> [Denver Post report] after a delay in an order from the Justice Department to supply ballots for Spanish-speakers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The secretary-general hailed the country's lead role in UN peacekeeping operations and addressed the controversial weapons <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45613&Cr=pakistan&Cr1=#.UguMwBYTP-Y">in a speech</a> [text] at the National University of Science and Technology in Islamabad, stating, "[a]s I have often and consistently said, the use of armed drones, like any other weapon, should be subject to long-standing rules of international law, including international humanitarian law. This is the very clear position of the United Nations. Every effort should be made to avoid mistakes and civilian casualties." 

<p>In June Pakistani <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22167511">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile] directed the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk">Pakistan Foreign Office</a> [official website] to contact US Ambassador Richard Hoagland to criticize US drone strikes. Sharif communicated that <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/08/189817233/pakistans-new-government-protests-u-s-drone-strike">Pakistan disapproves</a> [NPR report] of the drone strikes and considers them a violation of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Sharif stated it is crucial to create a joint strategy to prevent US drone strikes. The use of drone strikes by the US has come under attack recently. In May Chief Justice Dost Muhammad Khan of the High Court of Peshawar in Pakistan ruled that US drone strikes in the region are <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-declares-drone-strikes-illegal-directs-foreign-ministry-to-introduce-resolution-in-un.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report].

The lawsuit challenges a merger that would have created the world's largest commercial air carrier and would have put 86 percent of US air travel in the hands of four big airlines. In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2013/299960.pdf">statement</a> [press release, PDF] released by the DOJ, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] argued that the merger would substantially lessen competition for commercial air travel in local markets throughout the US and result in passengers paying higher airfares and receiving less service:<blockquote>Airline travel is vital to millions of American consumers who fly regularly for either business or pleasure. By challenging this merger, the Department of Justice is saying that the American people deserve better. This transaction would result in consumers paying the price&#8212;in higher airfares, higher fees and fewer choices. Today's action proves our determination to fight for the best interests of consumers by ensuring robust competition in the marketplace. If this merger goes forward, even a small increase in the price of airline tickets, checked bags or flight change fees would result in hundreds of millions of dollars of harm to American consumers. Both airlines have stated they can succeed on a standalone basis and consumers deserve the benefit of that continuing competitive dynamic.</blockquote>AMR and US Airways said they would fight the lawsuit in court rather than seek a compromise that might lead to a settlement. In a joint statement American Airlines and US Airways said, "[i]ntegrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together ... blocking this pro-competitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices."

<p>In June the <a href="http://www.gao.gov">Government Accountability Office</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655314.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] warning that the new airline would be the only carrier providing nonstop service on seven of the 12 routes where they currently compete. The report also said that the merger also would reduce competition on 1,665 other domestic routes and create new competition in just 210 routes. Talks of a merger began last year when US Airways began to pursue bankrupt American Airlines. The merger was seen as a natural fit in an aviation landscape that had evolved and dramatically consolidated since the industry was deregulated by Congress in 1978. In a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Senator <a href="http://www.rockefeller.senate.gov/public/">John Rockefeller IV</a> [official website] noted that during that time "consolidation was a necessary evil&#8212;no industry sector could sustain year after year of multibillion-dollar losses." Roy Kienitz, who served as undersecretary for policy at the Department of Transportation argued that, "the airline industry spent much of the last decade going bankrupt. As a consequence, we had a period where people got to fly for a price below what it cost to provide the service. But this cannot last. Something has to give." Kienitz also noted that he is concerned the effort to block the merger is rooted in a effort to go back to a time when prices were lower&#8212;a situation which he concluded was "unsustainable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Robert Scola stated that the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sec-wins-dismissal-lawsuit-over-handling-7-billion-164157943.html">SEC market regulator was shielded</a> [Reuters report] under an exception to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5806.pdf">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FTCA) [DOJ backgrounder], which bars claims arising from misrepresentation or deceit. Scola <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-allows-suit-against-sec-over-stanford-ponzi-scheme.php">previously ruled</a> [JURIST report] in September of last year that the lawsuit could proceed under the claim that the SEC had identified that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme on four occasions prior to his indictment in 2009, and that the SEC had a non-discretionary duty to report Stanford to the <a href="http://www.sipc.org/">Securities Investor Protection Corporation</a> (SIPC) [official website]. The suit also alleges that SEC investigators declined to pursue action against Stanford due to the complexity of his Ponzi scheme and instead chose to pursue easier cases, ignoring several warnings. In Monday's dismissal, however, Scola stated that he had no jurisdiction to decide the case due to the FTCA exception against claims arising from misrepresentation or deceit. Plaintiffs' attorney reported that they plan to appeal Monday's decision and stated, "We believe that the judge did not draw the appropriate distinction between a claim based on a misrepresentation and our claim based on a failure to warn in line with the SEC's mandatory duty to notify SIPC."

<p>Allen Stanford was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/financier-stanford-sentenced-to-110-years-for-ponzi-scheme.php">sentenced to 110 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] in June 2012 for his $7 billion Ponzi scheme. Earlier in March the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the victims of Stanford's Ponzi scheme would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-appeals-court-allows-class-action-for-stanford-ponzi-scheme-victims.php">permitted to pursue a class action</a> [JURIST report]. The trial against Stanford began in January after a judge ruled that he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-rules-financier-stanford-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. This judgment overruled a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-deems-financier-stanford-incompetent-to-stand-trial.php">previous holding to the contrary</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2011 Stanford <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/financier-stanford-sues-federal-agents-over-civil-rights-violations.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] several federal agents of depriving his constitutional rights by using abusive law-enforcement methods. Stanford was first <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-indicted-in-7.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Obama administration has since made plans to close the facility, and Congress has additionally cut funding for the project. In 2011 the NRC permitted the shutdown plan to stand, citing budgetary limitations as the cause. The NRC action <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/federal-appeals-court-orders-obama-admin-to-move-forward-on-yucca-mountain-nuclear-dump/2013/08/13/e6cfe588-042e-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html">goes against a federal law</a> [AP report] that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository. Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in Tuesday's majority opinion, "This case has serious implications for our constitutional structure. It is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers would be significantly altered if we were to allow executive and independent agencies to disregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."

<p>In July 2011 the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-to-force-nuclear-waste-storage-at-yucca-mountain.php">dismissed a similar case</a> [JURIST report] brought by Washington state, South Carolina and other local governments challenging the DOE failure to proceed with the Yucca Mountain project. The plaintiffs, responsible for the temporary storage of nuclear waste, challenged both a decision of the DOE to withdraw its application from the NRC for Yucca Mountain and its apparent abandonment of that project. The nuclear repository was not welcomed by Nevada government officials, who had been mounting challenges against the site since Congress approved government plans to construct the facility in 2002. Rejecting the challenges by Nevada officials, however, the DC Circuit ruled in 2004 that federal plans to build a nuclear waste site in the state were constitutional under the Takings Clause. Government officials fear that the repository, located 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, will negatively effect the city's lucrative tourism industry. The application for the repository had been pending since 2008 when it was filed by former president George W. Bush. The repository was approved by Congress in 1987 to contain highly toxic waste from nuclear complexes that built atomic bombs during the Cold War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the situation in Egypt is ongoing and the UN is still gathering information on the day's events, the secretary-general admonished Egyptian authorities for ignoring his recent call for all sides to strive for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-urges-egypt-political-parties-to-find-peaceful-resolution.php">peaceful resolution</a> [JURIST report] and instead responded violently toward demonstrators. Wednesday marked one of the bloodiest days in Egypt since the July 3 <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">ouster of president Mohammed Morsi</a> [JURIST report], with at least <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/14/211899204/deaths-reported-in-cairo-as-forces-move-on-morsi-supporters">275 killed and more than 2,000 injured</a> [NPR report]. The Obama administration also released a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/14/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-josh-earnest-egypt">statement</a> [text] condemning the violence and calling on the Egyptian military to show restraint and respect the rights of its citizens.

<p>While Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011, the country has been particularly volatile since the military deposed Morsi on July 3 and suspended the constitution. Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC report] has been acting as interim head of state since Morsi's ouster. On Monday an Egyptian judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-extends-morsi-detention.php">extended the Morsi's detention</a> [JURIST report] by another 15 days in order to investigate claims that he conspired with Palestinian militants during the 2011 uprising. The announcement sparked further protests and demonstrations by pro-Morsi supporters. In July Egyptian authorities announced that Morsi was being the subject of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-announce-criminal-investigation-of-morsi.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] for spying, ruining the economy and inciting violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

All benefits will be retroactive to the date of the ruling for current members who provide a valid certificate. Furthermore, "For civilian benefits administered government-wide to federal employees, the Department of Defense will follow the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Labor's guidance to ensure that the same benefits currently available to heterosexual spouses are also available to legally married same-sex spouses." Benefits are set to begin on or before September 3.

<p>The DOD has steadily increased benefits to same-sex couples since  the revocation of <a href="/feature/featured/dadt/">Don't Ask Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011.

According to the UN, the attorney general in Gaza announced that those executions stayed for Ramadan would recommence at the end of the Eid al-Fitr celebrations. Pillay objected to these executions based on the civil unrest in the region, which she believes makes it impossible for a fair trial to take place:<blockquote>One absolute requirement is that the death penalty can only be imposed after a fair trial. This is currently not possible in Gaza, neither legally nor practically. ... Serious concerns have also been raised about ill-treatment and torture during interrogations of persons later sentenced to death. ... Therefore I repeat my appeal to the de facto authorities in Gaza to implement a moratorium on executions and to fully uphold and promote the right to life.</blockquote>The UN has not yet indicated if face to face contact with Hamas leaders has occurred regarding these executions, but has urged a review of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. 

<p>The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/psindex.aspx">occupied Palestinian territories</a> [official website] in June <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13455&LangID=E">called on Israel</a> [statement] to end its blockade of the Gaza Strip. Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip has been a subject of controversy. In December 2012 the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">UN called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel was also <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-aid-groups-urge-israel-to-end-gaza-blockade.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to end the blockade in June of that year.

Supporters such as <a href="http://protectmarriage.com">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] had argued that a sole judge lacked the authority to overturn a state constitutional amendment, that applicable injunctions permitting same-sex marriage applied in at most two counties, and that state officials had overstepped their authority by ordering California county clerks to grant same-sex marriage licenses. The Supreme Court's refusal to revive Proposition 8 ends the last remaining legal challenge to same-sex marriage in the state. 

<p>In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf">Hollingsworth v.

Judge Jon DeGuilio found that Union Benefica Mexicana had no legal standing to sue the sheriffs and that the other named defendants had sovereign immunity under the <a href=http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxi>Eleventh Amendment</a> [text]. The lawsuit challenged parts of Indiana's immigration law allowing the state to sue employers to collect unemployment benefits from employers who knowingly employ unauthorized or illegal immigrants. The lawsuit also challenged sections of Indiana's immigration law dictating that workers seeking day-laborer positions must complete individual attestation-of-employment forms. 

<p>Various reforms have been made to Indiana's immigration law over the last few years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/13a0226p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that the Michigan law criminalizing begging is unconstitutional because it violates free speech rights. A person convicted under the Depression-era law is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both. The three-judge panel unanimously upheld a lower court decision that said Grand Rapids police were wrong to arrest two homeless men in 2011 for asking for change. The court said between 2008 and 2011, 399 people were arrested or issued tickets for begging in Grand Rapids. Of those, 211 were sentenced to jail terms. The court reasoned:<blockquote>As the Supreme Court has warned, statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society. Where, as here, the statute unquestionably attaches sanctions to protected conduct, the likelihood that the statute will deter that conduct is ordinarily sufficiently great to justify an overbreadth attack. Michigan may regulate begging. As the Supreme Court has said, '[s]oliciting financial support is undoubtedly subject to reasonable regulation.' But Michigan must regulate begging with due regard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views on economic, political, or social issues.</blockquote>The state argued that it has an interest in preventing fraud and said not all who beg are "homeless and destitute," or use the funds to meet basic needs. Rather, they often spend money on alcohol.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] has not directly decided whether individual solicitation of funds is a protected right under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text], but it has held repeatedly the First Amendment protects charitable solicitations by organizations. Robert Sedler, a Wayne State University law professor, said other courts have found aggressive panhandling is not a protected form of free speech, but there's nothing the government can do to stop someone from "peacefully" standing on a street corner asking for money. Earlier this year the US <a href="http://www.usich.gov/">Interagency Council on Homelessness</a> (ICH) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] issued a report which found that <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/criminalization-of-the-homeless-may-violate-human-rights.php">ordinances criminalizing homelessness may violate human rights</a> [JURIST report] as well as the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag5_user.html">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt8_user.html">Eighth Amendments</a> [text]. The report condemned the criminalization of the homeless through various acts of living, such as sleeping or conducting personal hygiene measures in public spaces and suggests alternatives to reduce homelessness and implement preventative measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In June a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/Shimari_Opinion%20Dismissing%20ATS%20Claims%206.26.13.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] the detainee's case, ruling that because the alleged abuse took place overseas the court had no jurisdiction to decide the case. CACI is now <a href="http://rt.com/usa/contractor-abu-ghraib-suing-prisoners-504/">asking</a> [RT report] its accusers to pay $15,580 for legal expenses. 

<p><a href="http://www.engilitycorp.com/">Engility Holdings Inc.</a> [corporate website], another defense contractor accused of torture related to Abu Ghraib, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-contractor-pays-5-million-settlement-in-lawsuits-alleging-torture-at-abu-ghraib.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] with 71 former detainees held at Abu Ghraib and other US-run detainment sites in Iraq between 2003 and 2007 for a total of $5.28 million.

However, a 14-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled 12-2 last year that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-appeals-court-revives-lawsuits-against-abu-ghraib-contractors.php">dismissal was premature</a> [JURIST report]. US military personnel have also been accused of torturing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=graner">Army Spc.

The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website], asserts that the "suspicionless" drug testing is a violation of residents' <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Two years ago, the CHA <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/21935417-761/aclu-to-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cha-drug-test-policy.html">sought to extend</a> [<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> report] the mixed-income housing drug-testing policy across the board to its 16,000 families in family and senior housing, requiring all adults living in or applying for housing to be tested for drugs. Amid a groundswell of outcry by residents and housing advocates, the agency quashed the proposal. The ACLU-IL has <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/long-time-resident-challenges-chicago-housing-authoritys-stigmatizing-drug-testing-program/">opposed</a> [press release] the CHA drug tests for many years, advocating against them before the CHA Board and in other places.

<p>Recently, mandatory suspicionless drug testing has become hotly contested. In May the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-florida-cannot-drug-test-all-state-employees.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Florida's <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2011/11-58-testing.pdf">Executive Order 11-58</a> [text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/florida-governor-signs-law-to-drug-test-state-employees.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] in March 2011, which would subject all state employees to drug testing, regardless of whether they were suspected of drug use. Earlier this year, JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="/dateline/2013/04/john-mcavoy-drug-testing.php">John McAvoy</a> and <a href="/dateline/2013/03/ilan-wurman-drug-testing.php">Ilan Wurman</a> [JURIST op-eds] discussed the drug testing of welfare recipients. In February the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds-block-of-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] blocking a Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2011/11-58-testing.pdf">law</a> [Executive Order 11-58, PDF] that required welfare applicants to pass a drug test before receiving benefits, stating that the law violated applicants' Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure.

PA 349 makes it illegal for employers to require employees to pay union dues, and is viewed by its opponents as a legislative attack on organized labor. The <a href="http://miaflcio.org/">AFL-CIO of Michigan</a> [union website], amongst others, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-labor-groups-file-federal-lawsuit-against-right-to-work-law.php">challenged the law</a> [JURIST report] because it was not clear whether government employees were included in the <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4200652211.PDF">applicable class of workers</a> [complaint, PDF]. The majority found that the law applies to state employees and that labor issues are within the legislature's discretion:<blockquote>Accordingly, we hold that, contrary to plaintiffs&#8217; claim, it is within the authority of the Legislature to pass laws on public policy matters in general and particularly those, as here, that unquestionably implicate constitutional rights of both union and nonunion public employees. ... Michigan case law fully supports the principle that the Legislature as the policymaking branch of government, has the power to pass labor laws of general applicability that also apply to classified civil service employees. For these reasons, we hold that 2012 PA 349 is constitutional as applied to classified civil service positions in Michigan.</blockquote>The AFL-CIO has not yet indicated if it will appeal or lobby to overturn the law.

<p>The Michigan legislation has been controversial since its passage in December. In January the <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan</a> (ALCUM) [advocacy website] and various labor organizations collectively filed similar lawsuits in state court against both the private and public sector laws, claiming that while the legislation was debated and passed, the public was prohibited from entering the Capitol through the public entrance by Michigan state police, affecting a "total denial of public access to the Capitol for over four hours" in contravention of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(js0tl5njdxycpu45n0zdxjnu))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-267-of-1976">Michigan Open Meetings Act</a> [text], the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28qt2y2345awbxplrdsiyrwc45%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> [materials] and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1toc_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. Previously, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">governor requested an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://courts.michigan.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website], following its September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">order</a> [JURIST report] that a collective bargaining initiative appear in a constitutional referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

North Carolina House Speaker <a href="http://www.thomtillis.com">Thom Tillis</a> [official website], a supporter of <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2013&BillID=h392">the bill</a> [HB 392, materials], released a <a href="http://nchousespeaker.com/news/">statement</a> [press release] expressing disappointment in the governor's veto. In the press release accompanying his veto of the bill, McCrory explained that he found the bill fiscally expensive for taxpayers and largely ineffective in fighting drug addiction. The North Carolina legislature can still try to override McCrory's veto. 

<p>Other states have also recently considered the issue of whether drug testing should be required for public benefit applicants. In February the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds-block-of-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lower court was correct in blocking a Florida law requiring public benefit applicants to pass a drug test before receiving benefits. In March a JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="/dateline/2013/03/ilan-wurman-drug-testing.php">discussed drug testing welfare recipients</a> [JURIST dateline] and argued that the Eleventh Circuit misapplied the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. In April a Guest Columnist <a href="/dateline/2013/04/john-mcavoy-drug-testing.php">examined</a> [JURIST report] how public policy affects the outcome of suspicionless drug testing of welfare applicants. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The man, known as DE, has already fathered one child with his girlfriend and the child is now cared for by DE's maternal grandmother. Mrs. Justice Eleanor King of the Court of Protection emphasized that a vasectomy is in DE's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=212544936&ft=1&f=">best interests</a> [AP report] because the alternative of fatherhood would cause DE significant psychological harm. The Official Solicitor emphasized that the case is not intended to inspire others to pursue for vasectomies for individuals with learning disabilities. This is the first ruling of its kind In the only other known British case involving male sterilization, the Court of Protection ruled that a vasectomy was not in the best medical and emotional interests of the individual in question. 

<p>Governments worldwide have struggled in recent years with the issue of advantages born out of sterilization versus individual liberties. In April the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-expert-eu-must-do-more-to-support-roma-peoples.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU member states to do more to ensure that Roma peoples, some of whom have been subjected to forced sterilization, receive the support necessary to fully enjoy all their basic human rights. In July 2012 a court in Namibia <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/namibia-court-rules-government-improperly-sterilized-hiv-positive-women.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government sterilized three HIV-positive women without obtaining appropriate consent. In November of 2005 the Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry announced it planned to <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/japan-appeals-ruling-requiring.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] a court ruling requiring the nation to pay compensation to former Taiwanese leprosy patients who were incarcerated during Japanese colonial rule, between 1916 and 1945, and subject to forced sterilization. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Congress approved the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr6304enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr6304enr.pdf">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act </a> [text, PDF] in 2008, granting the NSA broad authority to conduct surveillance of Americans to protect against terrorism and other foreign threats. The documents, leaked to the <em>Washington Post</em> by <a href="/feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Edward+Snowden">news archive</a>], describe more than 2,500 instances of the NSA exceeding its legal authority by engaging in unauthorized surveillance of Americans&#8212;including confusing a US area code with an Egyptian area code and intercepting a significant amount of US citizen phone calls. In response to the <em>Washington Post</em> report, the NSA stated:<blockquote>A variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next. They include, but are not limited to: implementation of new procedures or guidance with respect to our authorities that prompt a spike that requires "fine tuning," changes to the technology or software in the targeted environment for which we had no prior knowledge, unforeseen shortcomings in our systems, new or expanded access, and "roaming" by foreign targets into the US, some of which NSA cannot anticipate in advance but each instance of which is reported as an incident.</blockquote>The NSA concluded its remarks by reiterating its continued effort to identify potential incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment and to implement prevention measures to help minimize the number of incidents that occur.

<p>Revelations surrounding US government surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in the <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [FJC backgrounder] supporting efforts by <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate websites] to publish data concerning how many times the government invoked federal law to request user information for national security purposes. Also in July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging the NSA illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" in the wake of 9/11 and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order. Also in June several US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring and a criminal investigation into the activities of Snowden, who came forward as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. The US government has <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former government contractor Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-islamic-law-ban-challenged.php">case was brought</a> [JURIST report] by Muneer Awad, executive director of <a href="http://www.cair.com">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website], who argued that the amendment stigmatized his religion. Chief Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange found that the amendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by Oklahoma voters, violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the First Amendment and asserted that the state failed to prove a compelling interest for an amendment that only singled out one religion.

<p>In 2010 Miles-LeGrange <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-oklahoma-amendment-banning-use-of-islamic-l.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the amendment, preventing the measure from taking effect until a preliminary injunction scheduled for late November. Just days after the preliminary injunction, Miles-LeGrange <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-extends-order-blocking-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">extended the injunction</a> [JURIST report] stating that she <a href="http://www.koco.com/Restraining-Order-Extended-In-Sharia-Law-Case/-/9844716/10745436/-/tu6lqd/-/index.html">needed more time</a> [KOCO report] to deal with the issue. The amendment was sponsored by state Representative Rex Duncan, who <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">described it as a preemptive strike</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma that would <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybvivrs_MH0">undermine</a> [MSNBC report, video] Judeo-Christian principles on which he says the US is founded. Efforts to ban the consideration of Islamic law have also been <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/florida-house-approves-bill-outlawing-use-of-religious-and-foreign-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] in other states including Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

MDC filed a motion for Zimbabwe's constitutional court to overturn the election result. Despite declining to challenge the election further, outgoing Prime Minister and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zimbabwes-mdc-doubts-fair-hearing-election-challenge-171909751.html;_ylt=A2KJ2Uh.jw9SjVUARXhEDex_">vowed</a> [Reuters report] that MDC would continue its fight to restore democracy by other means, including forcing foreign companies to turn over majority stakes to local black citizens. 

<p>Recently Mugabe has faced scrutiny by several groups besides the MDC.

The ruling by Judge Bernard McGinley marks the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pennsylvania-judge-bars-enforcement-of-voter-id-law-in-nov-5-election/2013/08/16/5a1cab22-06ad-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html">third consecutive election</a> [AP report] in which the law, passed in March 2012, will not be in effect. Despite being an extension of the preliminary injunction issued before the November 2012 election, this ruling is <a href="http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/08/judge-blocks-voter-id-law-through-general-election">slightly modified</a> [<em>Daily Pennsylvanian</em> report] to bar the state from requiring election workers to voters that they would need ID in future elections. McGinley opined:<blockquote>It is not a matter of confusion&#8212;t is a matter of accuracy. ... Regardless of whether a request for photo ID causes confusion, telling a qualified elector that he or she will not have the right to vote in future elections if he or she does not obtain compliant photo ID, when that information has been erroneous at best, deceptive at worst, will not be continued. Not when this Court has witnessed two prior injunctions where the information, in effect, misled qualified electors.</blockquote>During the week-long trial, the court weighed plaintiff testimony, including <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20130817_Pa__Voter_ID_law_on_hold_for_November_election.html">claims</a> [<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> report] from witnesses that they did not vote in the May primary after being told last November they could not vote in the next election without ID. Both sides in the case anticipate the decision to be <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/state/pennsylvania-judge-bars-voter-id-enforcement-in-november-election-699578/">appealed</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] to the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website]. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a contentious issue in the US. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/PetitionApplewhite.pdf">challenged the law</a> [petition for review, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-challenged.php">report</a>] in May 2012, asking a court to block enforcement of the law for the November 2012 elections. The group claimed that the law violates the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/wu01/vc/visitor_info/creating/constitution.cfm">Pennsylvania Constitution</a> [text] and will prevent eligible voters from casting their votes. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/pennsylvania-governor-signs-voter-id-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] in March of last year. It was passed earlier that week in the House of Representatives by a vote of 104-88. In November 2012, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-judge-refuses-to-block-voter-id-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court upholding the law and remanded for further consideration. Unlike the current trend of voter ID laws, Pennsylvania's allows voters to vote without an ID as long as they verify their identity within six days of voting. Absentee ballots will also only require identification by Social Security number.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/ccspecialprocedures.htm">Coordination Committee</a> [official website], composed of six experts appointed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to oversee human rights concerns, violations and procedures, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13636&LangID=E">expressed their concern</a> [press release] regarding the escalating violence in the streets of Cairo, placing the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45636&Cr=egypt&Cr1=#.Ug-i-2T71cQ">death toll at 600</a> [press release] following continued clashes this week. Committee Chairman Chaloka Beyani stressed that peaceful demonstrations must not be met with violence, calling for a period of dialogue, reconciliation and inclusive political transition. 

<p>While Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011, the country has been particularly volatile since the military deposed president Mohammed Morsi on July 3 and suspended the constitution. Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC report] has been acting as interim head of state since Morsi's ouster. Earlier this month an Egyptian judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-extends-morsi-detention.php">extended the Morsi's detention</a> [JURIST report] by another 15 days in order to investigate claims that he conspired with Palestinian militants during the 2011 uprising. The announcement sparked further protests and demonstrations by pro-Morsi supporters. In July Egyptian authorities announced that Morsi was being the subject of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-announce-criminal-investigation-of-morsi.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] for spying, ruining the economy and inciting violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This proposal comes after Friday's protest orchestrated by the MB, which ended a week marked by more than 800 casualties and more than 1000 arrests. Although the government has not yet announced its decision on the prime minister's proposal, government spokesperson Sherif Shawky said that <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/17/Egypt-s-PM-proposes-legal-dissolution-of-Muslim-Brotherhood.html">several options were being reviewed</a> [<em>Al Arabiya</em> report], including the classification of the MB as an organized terrorist group. In response to these threats, the MB has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/08/18/Egypt-may-disband-Muslim-Brotherhood/UPI-78611376826134/">officially cancelled</a> [UPI report] all of Sunday's demonstrations. 

<p>While Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011, the country has been particularly volatile since the military deposed president Mohammed Morsi on July 3 and suspended the constitution. Since then, the UN has called Egypt to halt the violence several times, to no avail. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court Adly Mansour</a> [BBC report] has been acting as interim head of state since Morsi's ouster. Earlier this month an Egyptian judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-extends-morsi-detention.php">extended Morsi's detention</a> [JURIST report] by another 15 days in order to investigate claims that he conspired with Palestinian militants during the 2011 uprising. The announcement sparked further protests and demonstrations by pro-Morsi supporters. In July Egyptian authorities announced that Morsi was being the subject of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-announce-criminal-investigation-of-morsi.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] for spying, ruining the economy and inciting violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The district <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/world/article/Cleric-cleared-in-blasphemy-case-targeting-4740981.php">court held</a> [AP report] that the prosecution had not brought forward sufficient evidence to convict. The cleric, Khalid Chishti, accused the girl of burning pages from the Quran, but he was later accused of planting the pages. The girl, after being released on bond in 2012, moved to Canada along with her family. This case has sparked criticism both within Pakistan and around the world that the blasphemy law is being used to suppress Pakistan's Christian minority population.

<p><A href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy+law">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] in Pakistan carry <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-president-blasphemy-laws-must-not-be-misused.php">penalties</a> [JURIST report] ranging from a fine to capital punishment. In August 2012 Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said that the country's blasphemy laws would not be misused to persecute religious beliefs. Zardari's comments came after the young girl's arrest. Blasphemy laws are currently in effect in several countries around the world. In July the US Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-state-department-releases-religious-freedom-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual International Religious Freedom Report, documenting threats to religious freedom throughout the world.

Bugti was killed in a 2006 military operation ordered by Musharraf during his time as both president and army chief of Pakistan. Musharraf has been detained at his Islamabad farmhouse since April 19 for conspiracy to kill former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>] in 2007.

<p>Musharraf has had many legal troubles of late. In April the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] him from running for public office for the rest of his life and extended his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. Last week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law expands the state's previous background check requirements, which covered gun purchases from licensed firearms dealers or those occurring at gun shows, to cover gun sales between private parties as well. The law also requires all owners of firearms whose firearms are lost, misplaced or stolen to report the loss or theft to local law enforcement. Gun owners will have 72 hours after learning of the loss or theft to report it. Gun purchasers who wish to buy a gun in the state will have to obtain a firearm owners identification (FOID) card, which is issued by Illinois state police to applicants who have passed a screening of criminal and mental health records. The seller <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/19/us-usa-guns-illinois-idUSBRE97I00X20130819">must then call a state-run hotline</a> [Reuters report] to check the validity of a buyer's FOID card before making the sale. The new reporting requirement for lost and stolen guns is set to take effect immediately, while the new background check system will take effect in January of next year.

<p>Passage of the Illinois bill is the latest development in the national gun control debate. Last month the Illinois Senate joined with the Illinois House of Representatives to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/illinois-lawmakers-pass-concealed-weapons-bill.php">pass a bill</a> [JURIST report] that permits state residents to carry concealed firearms with limited restrictions. In April the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-new-york-concealed-carry-law.php">declined to hear a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to a New York state gun law, which requires those who desire to carry a concealed handgun to show they have a special reason to do so before they can obtain a license. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/utah-governor-vetoes-concealed-weapons-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed citizens to carry an unloaded, concealed gun without a permit. Also in March the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-maryland-concealed-carry-permit-restrictions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Maryland can require concealed-carry handgun permit applicants to provide a "good and substantial reason" for wanting to carry a gun outside the home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

MLAWD <a href="http://mlawd.org/2012/10/27/press-release/">sought</a> [press release] a declaratory ruling nullifying the MDNR auctions of mineral rights within Barry and Allegan State Game Areas and the Yankee Springs Recreation Area. The group contends that land leased might be subject to fracking, which could compromise the areas. Judge Amy McDowell <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130819/METRO06/308190080/1361/Judge-rejects-challenge-to-west-Michigan-gas-leases">ruled</a> [AP report] that the "mere act" of the state issuing non-developmental lease permits doesn't mean there's an imminent threat to the environment, and so the MDNR has not engaged in an activity that has violated the public trust.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">Hydraulic fracturing</a> [JURIST feature], commonly referred to as "fracking," is a highly debated topic in regions where recent Marcellus shale gas developments have been associated with toxic water pollution. In June Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Patrick Quinn</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/illinois-governor-signs-strictest-fracking-law-in-nation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the most restrictive fracking legislation in the country, now requiring all drillers to acquire a permit from the legislature, provide frackwater samples before, after and during drilling, and store used frackwater in above-ground tanks. The <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/">New York State Assembly</a> [official website] in March <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/new-york-lawmakers-approve-two-year-fracking-moratorium.php">approved a two-year ban</a> [JURIST report] on fracking, during which time a "comprehensive health impact assessment" can be conducted to identify potential public health impacts that may result from the process. The ban represents a continuation of a previous ban on fracking that has been in place in the state since 2008. Also in March, JURIST guest columnist Nicolas Parke <a href="/dateline/2013/03/nicolas-parke-fracking-regulation.php">debunked the rumors</a> [JURIST op-ed] around fracking. In February JURIST guest columnist Samantha Peaslee detailed the <a href="/dateline/2013/02/samantha-peaslee-home-rule-fracking.php">future of fracking</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Colorado in the wake of recent lawsuits against fracking companies in the state. In 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-agencies-submit-brief-in-shale-drilling-law-appeal.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-bill-to-allow-fracking.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/vermont-becomes-first-state-to-outlaw-fracking.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/new-jersey-legislature-passes-one-year-fracking-ban.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-ag-sues-us-government-for-failure-to-study-fracking-impact.php">New York</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/epa-announces-plan-to-develop-standards-for-fracking-wastewater-discharge.php">Environmental Protection Agency</a> [JURIST reports] all took regulatory, legislative and judicial steps towards restricting hydraulic fracturing for fear of environmental and public health concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/oklahoma-rights-group-challenges-law-limiting-sale-of-emergency-contraception.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] is the latest challenge to reproductive rights-related legislation adopted in Oklahoma. Prior to the passage of HB 2226 in May of this year, the text of the law was attached to another statute governing insurance forms. It was struck down for breaking the state's constitutional one-issue rule, requiring all laws to address only one subject. In July JURIST Guest Columnist Adam Banner <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/adam-banner-bill-1970.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] an order by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] for the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-issues-final-orders-of-term.php">clarify</a> its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">ruling </a>[JURIST reports] in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110765.html">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice v.

New Jersey is now the second state to ban such practices following a similar <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">ban in California</a> [JURIST report] last September. Christie <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/news/news/552013/approved/20130819a.html">publicly addressed the controversial issue</a> [press release], deferring to medical experts that have shown such practices can be detrimental to the psychological health of children. He also <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/news/news/552013/pdf/20130819a_A3371.pdf">expressed concern</a> [signing statement] about limiting the autonomy of parents in the making healthcare choices for their minor children, but insisted that the public benefits far outweighed such a restriction:<blockquote>I also believe that on issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards. The American Psychological Association has found that efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts. I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.</blockquote>The act is set to take immediate effect. 

<p>The practice of conversion therapy has come under scrutiny lately. Last November, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/gay-men-sue-conversion-therapy-group-for-fraud.php">four men sued a conversion therapy group</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey, claiming that the practice was a breeding ground for discrimination and fraud. California's legislation, the first of its kind in the US, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> last August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in May of last year. Supporters of the bill asserted that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and that therapies to reverse homosexuality were found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> (NARTH) [advocacy website] voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts relied on in the bill are generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy highlighted a <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bhutto, who was the first prime minister of any Islamic nation, was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/pakistan.bhutto/index.html">killed at a rally</a> [CNN report] addressing a large crowd of her supporters when a bomb exploded near her vehicle. Bhutto's death came just two weeks after a failed assassination attempt, and prosecutors have accused Musharraf of failing to provide adequate security protection for her. Musharraf appeared before the court in person and pleaded not guilty. He has been detained at his Islamabad farmhouse since April. After the hearing, counsel for Musharraf commented that all of the charges against his client are fabricated. 

<p>This is the latest development in the series of charges and legal troubles for Musharraf since Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] him for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In May the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf from running for public office for the rest of his life, as well as extending his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. Also in April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities pledged to arrest [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-authorities-order-arrest-of-muslim-brotherhood-leader.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Badie after escalating violence last month resulted in over 50 deaths. Badie was taken to Torah prision in Cairo, where other members of the Brotherhood and former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [official BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] are being held. His arrest is the latest move in a concerted effort to subdue the Brotherhood and restore order to the state. 

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked last month after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] Morsi, in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government.

Only one day after Morsi was ousted, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website].

The labor standards will apply to the 1.2 million workers who work on ships weighing more than 500 gross tonnes, excluding those who are employed by fishing ships and traditional vessels such as junks. The ILO attributes 90 percent of all shipping accidents to preventable human error, which is considerably worsened by fatigue.

Group member Yekaterina Samutsevic <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/555676">accused</a> [Izvestia Times report, in Russian] her former lawyer Violetta Volkova of making and posting defamatory statements about her in the press and on social networking sites during the trial of other Pussy Riot members. Sautsevich has demanded 2 million rubles (USD $60,750) in compensation for moral harm and damage to her reputation stemming from the incident. A preliminary court hearing is set for September 18.

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot has generated significant international attention. Last month a regional court in Russia on <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/russia-court-rejects-appeal-by-member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an appeal by Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina. Alekhina had filed the appeal after a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot-denied-parole.php">denied her parole</a> [JURIST report] in May. Alekhina and her fellow band mates, Samutsevic and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison for "hooliganism" following the band's February 2012 performance of a protest song titled "Mother of God drive Putin away." The song was performed at a sacred Russian Orthodox Church, Christ the Savior Cathedral, in Moscow and the court held that the performance was driven by religious hatred. Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">released on probation</a> [JURIST report] in October 2012 because police removed her from the Cathedral before she could actually participate in the performance, while Tolokonnikova was also denied parole in May. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a unanimous opinion, the court <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/crime/article/NC-judges-say-social-networking-ban-illegal-4745588.php">found</a> [AP report] that the law "arbitrarily burdens" registered sex offenders by preventing a wide range of communication and expressive activity without achieving its goal to protect children from contact with sexual predators. North Carolina <a href="http://law.onecle.com/north-carolina/14-criminal-law/14-208.7.html">requires</a> [NC Gen Stat &#167; 14-208.7] all persons convicted after January 1996 of sexually violent offenses or offenses against minors to register as sex offenders, and the registration must be maintained for a period of at least 30 years.

<p>The rights of convicted sex offenders have been the subject of many constitution-based lawsuits. <br />
In January the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] struck down an Indiana law that prohibits sex offenders from joining social networking websites, stating that the law targeted free speech and thus deserved careful scrutiny, a standard which it did not meet. In October a California resident <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-resident-sues-four-orange-county-cities-over-sex-offender-ordinances.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] four Orange County cities over sex offender ordinances. In August of last year a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-indiana-sex-offender-registry-violated-due-process.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the Indiana sex offender registry saying it violated due process. In January of last year the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-on-sex-offender-registration-act.php">ruled 7-2</a> [JURIST report] that people who were convicted of sex offenses before the enactment of the federal <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> [final guidelines, PDF] did not have to register under the act until the attorney general validly specified that the provisions applied to them. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-new-mexico-sex-offender-library-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ordinance that banned sex offenders from libraries in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

California authorities <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/20/us-usa-california-hungerstrike-idUSBRE97I0ZV20130820">went to the court</a> [Reuters report] for approval to force-feed some prisoners participating in a hunger strike after officials voiced concerns that inmates may have been coerced into refusing food. The hunger strike is on its forty-second day, and participants <a href="http://www.cphcs.ca.gov/docs/careguides/MassHungerStrikeCareGuide2012-10-4.pdf">risk</a> [text, PDF] organ failure, disruption of all metabolic function, loss of at least 18 percent of initial body weight and potential death, according to <a href="http://www.cphcs.ca.gov/">California Correctional Health Care Services</a> (CPHCS).

<p>The hunger strike <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/political/la-me-pc-ff-california-prison-officials-acknowledge-hunger-strike-20130708,0,3234974.story">began</a> [LAT report] on July 8, with approximately 30,000 inmates refusing meals in two-thirds of the state's 33 prisons, and at all four out-of-state private prisons. The protest was organized by a small group of inmates held in segregation at <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/PBSP.html">Pelican Bay State Prison</a> [official website], whose demands center on state policies that allow inmates to be held in isolation indefinitely for ties to prison gangs. According to a 2011 <a href="http://solitarywatch.com/2011/08/24/historic-california-assembly-hearing-on-solitary-confinement/">statement</a> [press release] from the undersecretary of the CDCR, the state's average solitary confinement term is 6.8 years. The protest involves the same issues and many of the same inmates who led a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/california-inmates-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-solitary-confinement.php">series of protests</a> [JURIST report] in California prisons two years ago. At the peak of the 2011 hunger strikes, more than 6,600 inmates refused meals. The CDCR <a href="http://cdcrtoday.blogspot.com/2013/08/hunger-strike-update_16.html">reported</a> [press release] last week that a total of 98 inmates have denied meals continuously since the hunger strike began on July 8, and a total of 190 inmates in eight state prisons are participating in the hunger strike. These numbers are down dramatically from 12,421 inmates reportedly participating on July 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This ruling is controversial because the complaint by presidential hopeful <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6439617.stm">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile] of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/zimbabwe-political-party-drops-challenge-to-election-results.php">withdrawn</a> [JURIST report] last week, citing corruption of the judicial process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontimmigration.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclusocal.org">American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] said Wednesday that they have uncovered a discriminatory national security program used by the US government to <a href="http://www.aclusocal.org/CARRP/">screen immigrants</a> [ACLU materials]. In a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website] alleging discriminatory practices in the denial of citizenship applications, the ACLU claims to have uncovered a government program called the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP), which they claim instructs federal immigration officers to find ways to deny applications that have been deemed a national security concern. CARRP was allegedly created in 2008 by the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] as a way to identify terrorists trying to become naturalized citizens. The ACLU argues that the program's reach is overly broad, discriminates against people based on religion and national origin, and has led to unwarranted delays and denials of citizenship applications. A spokesperson for the USCIS, Christopher Bentley, denied allegations that the program is discriminatory, arguing that it is "in compliance with immigration laws and with a steadfast commitment to maintaining the integrity of the immigration process."

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Immigration+Reform">Immigration reform</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be a divisive political and social issue in the US.

Approved in a 61-59 vote, the legislation gives the GCSB increased power to support other state departments including the New Zealand police, Defense Force and the Security Intelligence Service. The hotly contested legislation was reportedly opposed by over 75 percent of the New Zealand's population, who fear that the bill will result in increased surveillance of citizens in violation of their rights. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key defended the bill, insisting that it was necessary to protect the country against cyber-threats. 

<p>The GCSB amendment has been vehemently opposed by opposition parties, political leaders and concerned citizens since its introduction in May. On Monday more than 1,000 protesters crowded inside of the Auckland Town Hall to voice their concerns over the GCSB amendment. Amid questions regarding whether the bill would protect citizens from warrantless spying, Key abruptly ended the interview and left the press conference early. In June the <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.nz">New Zealand Law Society</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/68389/Government-Communications-Security-Bureau-and-Related-Legislation-Amendment-Bill-140613.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] opposing the bill, arguing that it "empowers the GCSB to spy on New Zealand citizens and residents ... in a way not previously contemplated and that is inconsistent with the rights to freedom of expression and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure."  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manning">news archive</a>] to 35 years in prison for his disclosure of classified information to the anti-secrecy organization <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website]. Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last month of violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 794 et seq., text] but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." In 2010 Manning leaked more than 700,000 government documents, diplomatic cables and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYTxuW2vmzk">classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and two Reuters journalists. The <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] formally charged Manning in July of 2010, but his bench trial did not begin until last month, nearly three years after his <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">initial arrest</a> [JURIST report]. Manning <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/manning-apologizes-said-he-hurt-the-united-states/2013/08/14/e1de6cb4-0525-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html">apologized</a> [WP report] during his sentencing hearing. He is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html">required to serve one-third of the sentence</a> [WP report] before he becomes eligible for parole, according to the military. He will receive credit for the 1,293 days he has been confined prior to the sentence.

<p>Manning's has sparked controversy since his arrest in 2010. In April the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces rejected a request by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) to gain access to court documents from Manning's case. That month the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. In February Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against him for providing classified materials to Wikileaks. Also in February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] that argued for Manning's release based on a lack of a speedy trial. In January the judge ruled that prosecutors must prove that Manning knowingly aided the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST report]. In November the judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a partial guilty plea to several of the minor charges against Manning. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case will undermine the validity of the eventual verdict. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW is especially <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/19/palestine-halt-execution-gaza-child-offender">concerned</a> [HRW report] with the specific case of Hani Abu Aliyan, an adult prisoner sentenced to death for the murder of a peer while he was a minor. Aliyan was convicted using a confession he alleges was produced under torture. Joe Stork, acting Middle East director at HRW, reflected on the precedent that such an execution would establish, "Imposing the death penalty for a crime committed by a child makes the executions under Gaza's abusive justice system especially atrocious. ... If the authorities want to deter criminals, they should make sure people are convicted for what they did, not what they are tortured to confess." Israel Jaber, the prosecutor general for Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has defended the court system, insisting that torture does not occur and that all convictions are the result of due process. </p>

<p>These anticipated executions have been the source of international concern since their announcement last week. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-urges-hamas-to-end-executions-in-gaza.php">urged</a>  [JURIST report] Hamas not to go through with the executions.

Mubarak's lawyer stated that he may be released as early as Thursday, as he has now been detained for the maximum allowable time in his case. This will be the first time he has been free in more than two years. It is unclear exactly how Mubarak's release will affect Egypt, which has been subject to a state of emergency for the last week amid <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-secretary-general-condemns-violence-in-egypt.php">violent clashes</a> [JURIST report] and a murder rate that reached 900 in the past week.

<p>Mubarak and other members of his former administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">referred to criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his position by illegally obtaining $49.2 million and real estates at discounted prices. In July an Egypt court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, even as their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law.

In June the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-arizona-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Arizona's <a href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2004/dec04/prop200.pdf">Proposition 200</a> [text], finding that Arizona's law requiring that proof of citizenship be provided in order to register to vote is preempted by federal law. However, the court preserved the states' rights to control who will vote by initiating separate litigation to request that the EAC include such a requirement among federal form's state-specific instructions. Kobach and Bennett have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/21/us-usa-voting-states-idUSBRE97K14M20130821">brought suit</a> [Reuters report] in response, accusing the EAC of preventing them from enforcing state laws that require proof of citizenship as a way to prevent illegal immigrants from voting.

<p>The controversial Proposition 200 was approved by Arizona voters in a <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/new-az-law-striking-fear-among.php">2004 referendum</a> [JURIST report] and has remained a contentious <a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] issue ever since. In April 2007 the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nith-circuit-rules-arizona-can-enforce.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Arizona could enforce its voter ID law while the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website] challenged the law in federal court. Later that year, a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-judge-rules-that-arizona-voter.php">rejected several claims</a> [JURIST report] made by MALDEF in a legal challenge to the law, including a claim that the ID law amounted to an unconstitutional poll tax. Additional claims included that the ID law disproportionately discriminates against minorities and that it violates the equal protection clause. In April 2012 the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-arizona-voter-id-law-strikes-down-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the portion of the law requiring voters to show ID at the polls but struck down the provision that required proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, stating that the requirement was inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/NVRA/">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [materials], which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-to-consider-arizona-eligibility-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] on the matter in October 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge George Smith <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-holds-somalia-colonel-responsible-for-1980s-torture.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] in November that constitutional law professor Abukar Hassan Ahmed was arbitrarily detained by Colonel Abdi Aden Magan's subordinates for three months in 1988. The <a href="http://www.cja.org/index.php">Center for Justice and Accountability</a> (CJA) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=422">lawsuit</a> [CJA materials] on behalf of Ahmed in 2010, when Magan was residing in Ohio. This is the largest amount ever awarded in a US court for the torture of one individual by another, but since Magan has left the US it is uncertain whether Ahmed could ever actually receive any damages. Ahmed currently serves as an adviser to the president of Somalia.

<p>US courts have recently supported international torture victims in several suits. In August the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-awards-21-million-in-lawsuit-against-former-somalia-pm.php">awarded $21 million</a> [JURIST report] to seven Somalis in a separate CJA <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=85">lawsuit </a>[CJA materials] against former Somali prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=samantar">Mohamed Ali Samantar</a> [JURIST news archive]. The lawsuit, which started in 2004 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-foreign-officials-not-immune-from-suit.php">made it to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] in 2010, alleged Samantar was responsible for the killing and torture of members of the Isaaq clan in Somalia throughout the 1980s under former dictator Siad Barre. In April 2011 the Virginia court denied a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-somalia-pm-can-be-questioned-under-oath-in-federal-suit.php">motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit against Samantar, whose lawyers had argued for dismissal because the statute of limitations had expired and because the courts should not interfere in political matters. That February a federal judge had ruled that Samantar was not entitled to legal immunity from <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-denies-immunity-to-former-somalia-pm.php">civil lawsuits</a> [JURIST report], following the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 </a>(FSIA) [28 USC &#167;&#167; 1330, 1602 et seq. text] does not provide foreign officials immunity from civil lawsuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/aclu-challenges-oklahoma-state-capitol-ten-commandments-monument">cites</a> [press release] the constitutional prohibition on using state property to support particular religions or sects in support of its petition. The ACLU also argues that the government has trivialized a "deeply sacred" text to Jewish and Christian believers by placing it in a political and secular context. The six foot tall, $10,000 monument was <a href="http://www.news9.com/story/23178058/aclu-sues-to-remove-oklahoma-10-commandments-monument">financed</a> [AP report] by Oklahoma State <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=80">Representative Mike Ritze</a> [official profile] and his family in 2009. 

<p>Ten Commandments displays have been the subject of legal controversy in recent years. The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] last August <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/appeals-court-blocks-order-to-remove-ten-commandments-monument-to-consider-standing-issue.php">ordered a lower court to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] its decision ordering Florida's Dixie County Courthouse to remove a Ten Commandments monument from its front steps. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] in February 2011 upheld a lower court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sixth-circuit-rules-against-ten-commandments-in-ohio-courthouse.php">barring the Ten Commandments</a> [JURIST report] from being displayed in an Ohio courthouse. The Sixth Circuit in June 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sixth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-ten-commandments-in-kentucky-courthouses.php">upheld an injunction against similar displays</a> [JURIST report] in two Kentucky courthouses. A month earlier, the same court denied an <em>en banc</em> rehearing in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0006p-06.pdf">another case</a> [opinion, PDF] involving the display of the Ten Commandments in a Grayson County, Kentucky, courthouse. The court found the display to be constitutional because it presented a valid secular purpose from the outset. In a 2005 decision, the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/ten-commandments-display-ruling-stirs.php">ruled in favor of a Ten Commandments display</a> [JURIST report] in a Mercer County, Kentucky, courthouse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The NSA sought approval to gather "upstream documents," email chains that contained multiple lines of communication, under Section 702 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> [text] but did not indicate that the communications targeted could include "wholly domestic" content. The court found the collection to violate the statute in addition to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> of the US Constitution. It is not clear how the government disposed of the unauthorized documents. 

<p>Revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism.php">US government surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked debate and controversy since the leak of confidential documents in June by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] gave a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-august-9-2013-news-conference-at-the-white-house/2013/08/09/5a6c21e8-011c-11e3-9a3e-916de805f65d_story.html">proposed</a> [transcript] a four-step reform to increase the credibility and legitimacy of the NSA and FISC. In July US lawmakers introduced a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/capital-calls-for-adversarial-system-in-surveillance-courts.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] to address popular concerns about personal privacy and the FISC, mandating that the court be presided over by judges that are nominated by the president and confirmed by Congress. During the same month the FISC permitted Yahoo to declassify a redacted 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/yahoo-allowed-to-disclose-nsa-data-requests-fisc.php">order</a> [JURIST report] that the company comply with the FISA in data collection. <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Civil liberties groups</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">Google and Microsoft</a> [JURIST reports] have directly challenged the court to declassify data collected under its orders. Other parties filed motions in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">federal court</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the NSA surveillance program that benefited from the FISC's oversight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW based its report on conversations with more than 120 victims of police corruption and examination of multiple criminal activities committed by corrupt police officers, ranging from charging crime victims for every stage of an investigation to extorting goods from street vendors. According to HRW, anti-corruption institutions like the <a href="http://www.lacc.gov.lr/">Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (LACC) [official website] are weak and manage to obtain few convictions in corruption cases. HRW urged the Liberian government to combat police corruption by establishing a civilian oversight board and immediately investigating the serious resource shortfalls in the national police.

Romano fled to Chile two years ago to avoid trial for his alleged involvement in more than 100 crimes against humanity while working as a prosecutor during the 1976-1983 Argentine <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war">news archive</a>]. Romano denies the charges against him, but the <a href="http://www.lacapital.com.ar/politica/Chile-decidio-extraditar-al-ex-juez-mendocino-Otilio-Romano-20130822-0037.html">decision is final</a> [<em>La Capital</em> report, in Spanish], and Romano will be deported in the coming days.

<p>The "Dirty War" was a seven-year military dictatorship, during which an estimated 30,000 people, many government opponents as well as ordinary citizens, were "disappeared" and taken to government facilities to be tortured and eventually killed. A court in Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-argentina-general-sentenced-to-life-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former military general <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] in March to life in prison for crimes against humanity. In February seven retired military officers were sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/argentina-retired-military-officers-given-life-sentences.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for various human rights abuses committed during the war. In December an Argentinian court sentenced former interior minister Jaime Smart to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for murder and detention of citizens. Smart was the first civilian minister to be convicted of crimes during the "Dirty War," but other civilians and police officers had been previously convicted. Two of Argentina's former dictators were also convicted last July of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/argentina-sentences-former-dictators-for-kidnapping-children-during-war.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] during the war and sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison. One of the dictators, Jorge Rafeal Videla, had already been sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/argentina-ex-dictator-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 for crimes against humanity during the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

British authorities allegedly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london">threatened legal action</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] against <em>The Guardian</em> and forced employees to destroy computer equipment, including hard drives and memory chips containing information leaked by Edward Snowden. In an <a href="http://hub.coe.int/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=199f9b57-954d-44aa-84ee-4ab758139da6&groupId=10227">open letter</a> [text, PDF] to British Home Secretary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> [official biography], the Council of Europe warned that such measures by the British government may have a "chilling effect" on journalists' freedom of expression and asked for more information on the allegations.

<p>The revelations surrounding the US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In June the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">came forward</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in early June as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also required non-collecting online retailers whose gross sales in Colorado exceed $100,000 to mail annual notices to residents who purchased more than $500 in goods from them during the preceding calendar year. The law was intended to urge non-collecting retailers, such as Amazon.com, to start charging the tax. The Tenth Circuit based its decision on the Tax Injunction Act, which states that federal courts should not enjoin, suspend or restrain any state tax assessments or collections if the disputed matter can be resolved by lower courts. The decision also relied on a report stating that Colorado's state and local government stand to lose $172.7 million year last year due to the failure of residents to pay the 2.9 percent use tax on e-commerce purchases from out-of-state retailers. 

<p>The role of sales taxes has been a topic of frequent discussion lately. In May the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-states-to-tax-internet-purchases.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would subject online shopping, a traditionally tax-free frontier, to state sales tax. In March New York's top court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/new-york-high-court-rules-state-can-collect-sales-tax-from-out-of-state-companies.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state may impose a sales tax on out-of-state retailers that do business within the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-calls-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">rejected the Texas law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after it came into effect in April 2012, noting that SB 14 would have a disproportionate impact on the state's Latino voters, and that the law is potentially discriminatory. The charge came only a month after Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/doj-objects-to-texas-voter-id-law.php">sent a letter on behalf of the DOJ</a> [JURIST report] claiming that the law violated Section 5 of the VRA.

The refugees, who have been detained for at least two-and-a-half years, brought their complaints to the Committee when they were unable to challenge the legality of their detention in Australian courts. The Committee, composed of 18 independent human rights experts, found that the refugees' detention was arbitrary and violated Article 9 of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], which states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, based on the fact that the refugees were not told the reasons for the negative security assessment, preventing them from mounting an effective legal challenge to their detention. Seven of the refugees who filed complaints with the Committee have since been released.

<p>Australia's laws and policies governing the treatment of migrants continue to raise human rights concerns. Spokespersons for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) and the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner of Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official websites] had previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-experts-concerned-about-australia-offshore-detention.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] that the reopening of offshore detention centers to process migrants and asylum-seekers may lead to indefinite detention and human rights violations. In November 2006 the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/australia-court-rules-refugees-on.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases that a "holder of a temporary protection visa is not entitled to further protection in Australia if they are no longer in danger in the country from which they fled" and that the person may not remain a refugee, allowing the Australian government to repatriate those deemed no longer to be in danger. In 2005 the UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/un-criticizes-australian-illegal.php">criticized Australia</a> [JURIST report] for its strict policy of detaining illegal immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, with illegal immigrants and asylum seekers spending years in remote detention camps while their applications for granting refugee status are assessed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While restrictions on Christianity have been removed in one state, the next state still struggles with Buddhist and Muslim retaliatory violence, while yet another region still must address the mandatory release of all prisoners of conscience. The most concerning event, however, occurred in Meiktila of the Mandalay Region, the site of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">43 murders related to mob violence in March</a> [JURIST report]. Quintana expressed his hopes that the internal stabilization of human rights he witnessed in some regions would continue to spread to the rest of the country. 

<p>Concern over <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Myanmar">Myanmar's sectarian violence and human rights record</a> [JURIST news archive] has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. Last month Quintana praised the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/myanmar-un-rights-expert-welcomes-latest-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php">release of 73 prisoners of conscience</a> [JURIST report] when the president granted immunity to all those held. This came as a response to a demand from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] that the government of Myanmar do more to combat religious and ethnic <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-chief-urges-myanmar-to-combat-ethnic-and-religious-discrimination.php">discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against minorities or risk undermining the reform movement in the country. In May and April Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-for-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">worked</a> <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">closely</a> [JURIST reports] with Myanmar officials to address concerns about the widespread persecution of Muslims and religion-based mob violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the law, facilities prescribing Mifepristone, the so-called "abortion pill," will be defined as an abortion clinic and be required to meet regulatory requirements of surgical facilities, even when they do not provide surgical procedures. Such renovations and updates can be interpreted to include the provision of operating rooms, the likes of which can cost millions for clinics that do not already have such facilities and do not plan to provide any operations. Betty Cockrum, President of PPINK, reflected on the medical and legal implications of the amendment:<blockquote>The additional restrictions in this new law are in no way related to patient safety. ... This law is clearly part of a coordinated national effort to end access to safe, legal abortion by trying to shut down Planned Parenthood health care centers, which also provide Pap tests, breast and testicular exams, birth control and STD testing and treatment.</blockquote>PPINK is represented by the national <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> organization and the <a href="http://www.aclu-in.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana</a> [advocacy websites].

<p>A number of states have recently passed laws relating to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=reproductive+rights">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Earlier this month a Wisconsin judge issued an injunction against that state's abortion law until the ACLU's legal challenge against its <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wisconsin-doj-seeks-to-stay-abortion-law-injunction.php">constitutionality is determined</a> [JURIST report]. In July Ohio instituted <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">new restrictions</a> [JURIST report] requiring women to first undergo ultrasounds before having an abortion. In April North Dakota <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a measure banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">Arkansas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> and <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">several other states</a> [JURIST news archive] have all taken similar controversial measures in the name of surgical safety. <br />

The law would have cut off funding to such health care providers for other medical needs such as contraceptives, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings. The three-judge panel concluded that the law  limits patients' options when choosing a doctor, which violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">Medicaid statute</a> [text] and reasoned that "the free-choice-of-provider provision unambiguously requires that states participating in the Medicaid program allow covered patients to choose among the family-planning medical practitioners they could use were they paying out of their own pockets." Supporters of the ruling see it as a victory for low-income women, while opponents argue that the ruling will continue to subsidize the abortion industry.  

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. Last October the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined to reconsider</a> its August decision to allow Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">defund Planned Parenthood</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law that would block Medicaid funding for abortion providers earlier that same month. In August the Fifth Circuit upheld Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">revoke an abortion clinic's license</a> [JURIST report] immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. That same month a Kansas judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-lawsuit-challenging-abortion-clinic-regulations.php">refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's new abortion clinic regulations after state officials asked that they be upheld without a trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ultimahora.com/ffaa-podra-salir-la-calle-orden-cartes-n715555.html">grant of power</a> [<em>Ultima Hora</em> report, in Spanish] came after five security guards were were killed by the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) in northern Paraguay. Opponents of the move argue that granting Cartes such power violates balance of power principles, while proponents argue that it is necessary to combat the criminal activity of the EPP. 

<p>The EPP, formed in 2001, is a relatively small, nationalist guerrilla group operating in the northeast region of Paraguay. It is a spin-off of the now defunct fringe group, the Free Homeland Party (PPL). The Paraguayan government characterizes the EPP as a terrorist organization responsible for more than 27 separate armed attacks since 2005. Led by Manuel Cristaldo Mieres, the EPP is believed to be responsible for the kidnapping of Cecilia Cubas, the daughter of former president Raul Cubas. The Paraguayan government hopes that granting Cartes unilateral power to send troops to northern Paraguay will help shut the organization down.</p>

The alleged attacks were part of the Syrian government's efforts to drive out rebel forces from the area. Pillay noted, "The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under customary international law." Following calls by 35 member states for the UN's chemical weapons expert to investigate the area, Argentina's UN ambassador and current Security Council president urged a thorough examination of the attacks. It is currently unknown how many individuals were killed in the attack.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mubarak's <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/egypts-ousted-leader-mubarak-under-house-arrest-220432156.html;_ylt=A2KJjalkohdSKxUAnYZEDex_">release</a> [AP report] comes amid widespread protests led by the <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] following last month's <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-authorities-arrest-muslim-brotherhood-leader.php">ouster</a> [JURIST news report] of president Mohammed Morsi. Although Mubarak's release of comes at a politically charged time in Egypt, there has been little protest. Mubarak's current physical condition is unknown, with rumors including a stroke, a heart attack and a coma.

<p>Mubarak and other members of his former administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. Earlier this week a court in Cairo <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubarak.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's release. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> JURIST report] and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">referred to criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his position by illegally obtaining $49.2 million and real estates at discounted prices. In July an Egypt court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, even as their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law.

The panel <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/23/us-usa-afghanistan-trial-idUSBRE97L0YV20130823">deliberated for less than two hours</a> [Reuters report]. The commanding general overseeing the court-martial still has the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/jury-life-prison-afghanistan-massacre-20051232">option to reduce the sentence</a> [AP report] to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Bales has never explained his actions but offered an apology to the victim's families on Thursday. The victim's families have expressed dissatisfaction with both the sentence Bales received and the apology Bales offered. The murders represent the worst case of murder of civilians on the part of military personnel since the Vietnam War.

<p>This outcome was not unexpected, since Bales <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-killing-16-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July to the premeditated murder of the Afghan civilians in order to comply with a plea deal and avoid the death penalty. Last November the prosecution articulated its desire to seek the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/us-military-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news report] against Bales. That announcement came just one week after hearings in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hearing-begins-for-us-army-sergeant-accused-of-killing-16-afghan-civilians.php">case began</a> [JURIST report]. The charges of alcohol and steroid usage was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-army-amends-charges-in-afghan-shootings-case.php">added</a> [JURIST report] last June. The first charges were <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-soldier-charged-with-17-counts-of-murder-in-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's opinion <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-samsung-not-disclose-profit-163929041.html">reversed</a> [Reuters report] a ruling by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/forms">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] which required the companies to disclose certain financial details including profit and sales information. Friday's opinion was based on the perspective that public requests for disclosure are outweighed by the company's need for confidentiality when the information is not crucial to a judicial ruling. Apple and Samsung have remained silent about the effect of the ruling.

<p>Apple has been involved in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission (ITC)</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-trade-commission-rules-against-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed two patents of Apple. The two companies have been engaged in patent litigation since 2010, each filing lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. Earlier this month, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/obama-administration-overturns-ban-on-sale-of-some-ipads-iphones.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a US trade panel ban on the sale of older iPads and iPhones. In June the Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-suit.php">ruled for Apple</a> [JURIST report] in a patent infringement suit. Similarly in March a UK court also ruled for Apple <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">permitting continued use of technology</a> [JURIST report] that allows transfers of information over the third-generation networks that are used by smartphones. In January a Dutch court ruled that the designs of some Galaxy Tab models produced by Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/dutch-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">do not infringe designs patented by Apple</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In several California prisons, hunger strikes began on July 8, with more than 30,000 inmates refusing food to protest the allegedly cruel use of solitary confinement as punishment within the state's system. Mendez asserted that prolonged solitary confinement is a cruel, inhumane method of punishment stating, "[e]ven if solitary confinement is applied for short periods of time, it often causes mental and physical suffering or humiliation, amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if the resulting pain or sufferings are severe, solitary confinement even amounts to torture." Mendez also urged the US government to ban the use of solitary confinement in other situations, including for juveniles, persons with psychosocial disabilities, pregnant women, those serving a life sentence and prisoners on death row. Additionally, Mendez stressed that it is not acceptable to use threats of forced feeding against individuals undergoing the hunger strike.

<p>California's prison system has been under scrutiny since 2006, when the state's governor proclaimed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=4278">prison overcrowding state of emergency</a> [text]. In August, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/supreme-court-rejects-california-request-to-block-prisoner-release.php">refused to stay an injunction</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed for the early release of nearly 10,000 California inmates by the end of the year. In July, Amnesty International (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-urges-improvement-in-california-prison-conditions.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] California to end conditions for prisoners in solitary confinement and order an impartial investigation into the recent death of a prisoner who had been in solitary confinement for five years. In May, <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] and various state prison officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-governor-appeals-order-to-curb-prison-overcrowding.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] after a panel of federal judges in April refused to vacate or modify their <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/Order-population-reduction.pdf">2010 order</a> [text, PDF] for reduction of the California inmate population. In January of this year, Brown issued a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-docs-01-07-13/Terminating-Prison-Overcrowding-Emergency-Proclamation-10-4-06.pdf">proclamation</a> [text, PDF], in order to effectively terminate the 2006 state of emergency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers for Musharraf argued that he <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/594614/court-rejects-musharraf-security-fears-in-bugti-death-case/">faced numerous threats</a> [AFP report] in Balochistan and requested, for security purposes, that his trial be transferred. Bugti was killed in a 2006 military operation ordered by Musharraf during his time as both president and army chief of Pakistan. Musharraf has been detained at his Islamabad farmhouse since April 19 for conspiracy to kill former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>] in 2007.

<p>Musharraf has had many legal troubles of late. Last week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. Also last week, a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">officially charged</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of Bhutto. In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a>  Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. That same month, the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan both <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST reports] Musharraf from running for public office for the rest of his life and extended his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45684&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.Uhn73xYTP-Y">called for an immediate investigation</a> [UN News Centre report] into the use of chemical weapons in Syria and asked the country's government to fully cooperate in the investigation, noting: <blockquote>It is clear that the situation in Syria continues to worsen. The humanitarian suffering is alarming. Sectarian tensions have been ignited. Regional instability is spreading. The death toll unfortunately has now surged past 100,000 people. The images of victims from this latest incident, including many children, are heartbreaking and sickening. </blockquote> Ban's statement follows UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay's</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of the reported chemical weapon attacks and reaffirmed the UN goal of achieving "complete cessation of hostilities, delivering humanitarian assistance and getting the Government and the opposition to the negotiating table in Geneva as soon as possible." 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mubarak was recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/mubarak-placed-under-house-arrest.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest at a military hospital after a court concluded that he served the maximum in time allowed in connection with the long-pending corruption case. Mubarak's hearing is now <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-25/trial-of-egypt-brotherhood-chiefs-adjourned/4911184">scheduled for September 14</a> [ABC/AFP report], after the court created three evidentiary committees for the hearing.

<p>Mubarak and other members of his former administration have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. Earlier this month a court in Cairo <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubarak.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's release. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. In July an Egypt court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, even as their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud, using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The directive does not give deportation relief to undocumented immigrants, but does stress alternatives such as placing individuals at facilities closer to their home and family. One prominent change to the previous policy is that ICE agents in each field office will particularly be assigned as field points of contact for parental rights issues. House Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://goodlatte.house.gov/">Robert W. Goodlatte</a> [official website] has <a href="http://goodlatte.house.gov/press_releases/444">spoken out against the policy</a> [press release] as an abuse of presidential power.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue over the past several years. In January, US Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/janet-napolitano">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-adminisration-announces-immigration-rule-to-ease-family-separation.php">announced a new rule</a> [JURIST report] making it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens if they have an immediate relative who is an American citizen. In October 2012 Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-mississippi-governor-phil-bryant.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">challenging a policy directive</a> [JURIST report] announced by the Obama administration that instructs immigration enforcement agencies not to enforce deportation laws against certain young people who were brought to the US as children but never became citizens. Shortly after the Obama administration announced this rule, Iowa <a href="http://steveking.house.gov/index.php">Congressman Steve King</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/iowa-congressman-to-sue-obama-over-new-illegal-immigration-policy.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] indicating his plans to sue the administration in order to delay implementation of the policy, and Arizona Congressman Ben Quayle <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-block-new-immigration-policy.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] to block enforcement of the policy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges against the three include incitement to violence in connection with a protest which killed 9 people and wounded over 90 near the group's headquarters on June 30.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [official BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. Only one day after Morsi was ousted, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report]. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC profile], took the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state after Morsi's ouster. Earlier this month, the Egyptian prime minister proposed <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-pm-proposes-legal-dissolution-of-muslim-brotherhood.php">formally dissolving</a> [JURIST report] the non-governmental organization registration of the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to force the group underground. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] last month <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities</a> [JURIST report] to address the escalating violence. According to the OHCHR more than 80 people have been killed and over 1000 injured since political turmoil gripped the nation last month. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ecuador's abortion laws impose prison terms ranging from one to five years for women who obtain abortions. In the press release accompanying the report, HRW women's rights researcher Amanda Klasing declared that women who are victimized by sexual violence should not be punished for getting an abortion:<blockquote>A woman or girl who has suffered the trauma of rape shouldn't have to face the prospect of going to jail if she chooses to get an abortion. Criminalizing abortion for rape victims not only violates women's and girls' rights, it may put their health or even their lives at risk.</blockquote>Ecuador is currently debating changes to its criminal code, although it is unclear whether penalties for obtaining abortions will be lifted or decreased.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">Abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be an extremely controversial issue both in the US and abroad. Last week the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona law that disqualified health providers which perform abortions from receiving public funds. Also last week <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] sued the Indiana Department of Health, challenging a regulation that requires clinics that dispensed abortion pills to <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/indiana-planned-parenthood-challenges-new-abortion-regulations.php">meet regulatory requirements of surgical facilities</a> [JURIST report], even when they do not provide surgical procedures. Earlier this month Wisconsin <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wisconsin-officials-appeal-abortion-law-injunction.php">appealed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking its abortion law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. In July Ireland's president <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ireland-president-signs-countrys-first-abortion-bill.php">signed the country's first abortion bill into law</a> [JURIST report], legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life at risk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011, the country has been particularly volatile since the military deposed president Mohammed Morsi on July 3 and suspended the constitution.

The draft law, if enacted, would require nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to obtain official registration to operate; would provide broad and difficult to interpret regulatory authority for NGOs; and could subject groups to arbitrary decisions without opportunity for appeal. Members of groups that fail to register could face criminal charges. The draft law also requires NGOs to re-register every five years. HRW stated:<blockquote>The draft law should be revised to comply with international standards. It should make registration voluntary, and eliminate criminal and other penalties for organizations that do not register. Vague and unspecified provisions should be clarified so that the government cannot use the law to target critics by denying them registration. While governments have a legitimate regulatory interest in providing benefits to civil society organizations that register as legal entities and preventing criminal activity, such regulations should not provide a cover to undermine rights to freedom of association, expression, and assembly.</blockquote>The draft law also places restrains on international organizations operating within Myanmar.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's sectarian violence and human rights record has continued recently. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/asiaregion/pages/mmindex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar</a> [official website], Tomas Ojea Quintana, last week <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-urges-reconciliation-in-myanmar.php">applauded</a> [JURIST report] recent government efforts to encourage a culture of respect between clashing political and religious sects but recognized the need for increased government action on a wide array of issues. Last month Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/myanmar-un-rights-expert-welcomes-latest-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php">praised the release of 73 prisoners of conscience</a> [JURIST report] when the president granted immunity to all those held. This came as a response to a demand from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] that the government of Myanmar do more to combat religious and <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-chief-urges-myanmar-to-combat-ethnic-and-religious-discrimination.php">ethnic discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against minorities or risk undermining the reform movement in the country. In May and April Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-for-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">worked</a> <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">closely</a> [JURIST reports] with Myanmar officials to address concerns about the widespread persecution of Muslims and religion-based mob violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sri Lanka's government fought a brutal <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">26-year civil war</a> [JURIST backgrounder] with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder] that ended in 2009.

Sri Lanka has not investigated allegations that up to 40,000 civilians were killed during the final months of the civil war.

<p>The UN and other international human rights groups have urged Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes committed during its  civil war with the LTTE. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-no-progress-in-sri-lanka-since-civil-war-ended.php">there has been no progress</a> [JURIST report] regarding respect for basic rights and liberties in the four years since the end of the country's civil war. In March the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-body-adopts-resolution-on-sri-lanka.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. In February Sri Lankan authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">accused of using rape</a> [JURIST report] as a method of interrogating members or supporters of the LTTE. Earlier that same month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized Sri Lanka</a> for failing to investigate war crimes, and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-pushes-un-for-independent-investigation-of-sri-lanka-rights-abuses.php">pushed</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent investigation of rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The changes also contains additional provisions to ensure the protection of children.

<p>Proposed changes to marriage laws in India have sparked protests.

Groups also voiced the opinion that the law discriminates against men by providing that women are to receive at least 50 percent of their husbands assets upon divorce.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Texas <a href="https://www.oag.state.tx.us/index.shtml">Attorney General Greg Abbott</a> [official website] said in a brief that the state would benefit from the court ruling on the issue and declaring the state's same-sex marriage ban does not violate the US Constitution. In both cases, the state intervened out of a belief that, in deciding to ban <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder], family law in Texas also requires the state and its agency to refuse to validate same-sex marriage through granting same-sex divorce. The court will <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/aug/24/texas-high-court-consider-same-sex-divorce/">hold oral arguments</a> [AP report] on November 5. 

<p>In 2010 the <a href="http://www.5thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/">Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/texas-appeals-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Texas's same-sex marriage, ruling that it did not violate the US Constitution. However, several lawsuits have been filed in the wake of the recent US Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Earlier this month, Virginia joined the list of other states that have <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/rights-groups-file-lawsuit-seeking-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia.php">recently taken measures regarding same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. In March the ACLU of New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-new-mexico-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of two same-sex couples seeking the legal right to marry. In the same month Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted in favor of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize civil unions in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tayfun Okatan was convicted on three counts relating to illegally bringing a German citizen into the US. When detained by an officer and asked whether he was attempting to bring someone into the country, Okatan requested a lawyer. The lower court barred the admission of all conversation that took place after his request was denied. The prosecution was, however, permitted to present the request itself as evidence against Okatan. The appeals court ruled that the prosecution's use of his request as evidence against him violated Okatan's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] rights:<blockquote>The Fifth Amendment guaranteed Okatan a right to react to the question without incriminating himself, and he successfully invoked that right. As the First Circuit has observed, allowing a jury to infer guilt from a prearrest invocation of the privilege "ignores the teaching that the protection of the fifth amendment is not limited to those in custody or charged with a crime."</blockquote>The case has been remanded for further proceedings.

<p>Courts continue to wrestle with the application of the Fifth Amendment. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-accused-must-invoke-fifth-amendment-privilege.php">ruled 5-4</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/salinas-v-texas/">Salinas v. Texas</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a defendant must expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. JURIST Guest Columnists Hank Asbill, Brian Murray and Andrew Pinson of Jones Day argued last month that the decision left a host of <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/asbill-murray-pinson-salinas.php">critical questions unanswered</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN said that international treaties protect its offices and all diplomatic missions from interference, spying and eavesdropping. The German magazine <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/">Der Spiegel</a> [media website, in German] <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/nsa-hoerte-zentrale-der-vereinte-nationen-in-new-york-ab-a-918421.html">reported</a> [text, in German] Sunday that the NSA was able to monitor UN communications after it decoded the UN's internal video conferencing system last year. <em>Der Spiegel</em> referenced the classified documents that were stolen by former NSA worker <a href="http://feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST profile], who has currently been granted asylum in Russia. According to <em>Der Spriegel</em>, the documents reveal that in addition to bugging the New York headquarters of the UN, the NSA has a surveillance program called the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/united-nations-says-contact-united-states-over-spying-170925952.html">"Special Collection Service</a>" [Reuters report], which has bugged over 80 embassies and consulates around the world.  

<p>Revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism.php">US government surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked debate and controversy since the leak of confidential documents in June. Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-august-9-2013-news-conference-at-the-white-house/2013/08/09/5a6c21e8-011c-11e3-9a3e-916de805f65d_story.html">proposed</a> [transcript] a four-step reform to increase the credibility and legitimacy of the NSA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). In July US lawmakers introduced a <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/capital-calls-for-adversarial-system-in-surveillance-courts.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] to address popular concerns about personal privacy and the FISC, mandating that the court be presided over by judges that are nominated by the president and confirmed by Congress. During the same month the FISC permitted Yahoo to declassify a redacted 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/yahoo-allowed-to-disclose-nsa-data-requests-fisc.php">order</a> [JURIST report] that the company comply with the FISA in data collection. <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Civil liberties groups</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">Google and Microsoft</a> [JURIST reports] have directly challenged the court to declassify data collected under its orders. Other parties filed motions in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">federal court</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the NSA surveillance program that benefited from the FISC's oversight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Days before entering the EU on July 1, the Croatian government changed the country's laws to prevent extradition of suspects for crimes occurring before 2002. This act is seen by many to be an attempt to protect veterans from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croatian War for Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], spanning from 1991-1995. The European Commission has accused Zagreb of <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130826/croatia-clashes-eu-over-extradition-law">intentionally infringing upon EU law</a> [Reuters report] and plans for top officials to meet and discuss what, if any, action is to be taken. Proposed remedies may include a decrease in financial aid or an increase in monitoring the country's compliance with EU law.

<p>Croatia has previously been criticized by groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] for the slow pace of war crimes investigations. AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">noted</a> (report, PDF) that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. Amidst pressure to the tackle this issue of corruption, the <a href="/dateline/2012/04/ann-eisenberg-croatia-eu.php">push to join the EU</a> was a <a href="/dateline/2012/05/dora-rotar-croatia-eu.php">primary focus</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the nation's rulers for years. In January of this year the Croatian people <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/croatia-citizens-votes-to-join-eu.php">voted in favor</a> of joining the EU, a month after the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/croatia-signs-treaty-to-join-eu.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST reports] to finalize its EU accession. The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-gives-final-approval-to-croatia-membership.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] for Croatian membership in 2011 after six years of negotiations. The EU had previously <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended accession talks</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 when it felt Croatia was not cooperating fully with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia investigations into war crimes against its former military officers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abedini was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-court-sentences-us-pastor-to-eight-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in January by a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Iran to eight years in prison for threatening national security through his leadership in Christian house churches. Before the two-judge panel refused his appeal, Abedini's lawyers had been hopeful that his case would be shown greater leniency under the new leadership of Iranian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22886729">President Hasan Rowhani</a> [BBC profile]. Jordan Sekulow, Executive Director of the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website], who represents Abedini's wife and two children, <a href="http://aclj.org/iran/aclj-iran-delivers-devastating-blow-to-american-pastor-saeed-rejects-appeal-affirms-8-year-prison-sentence">expressed his regret</a> [press release] over Sunday's decision, stating that it "underscores Iran's continued violation of principles of freedom of religion, association, peaceful assembly, and expression." 

<p>Abedini, 32, became a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-pastor-iran-idUSBRE90R00Q20130128">US citizen through marriage</a> [Reuters report] in 2010 and had been traveling between the US and Iran since he was ordained a minister through the <a href="http://wordpress.aeaministries.org/">American Evangelistic Association</a> [advocacy website] in 2008. In the summer of 2012 Iranian authorities placed Abedini on house arrest, then sent him to prison in September where he was beaten and tortured, according to the ACLJ. Judge Pir-Abassi <a href="http://aclj.org/iran/lies-and-conviction-iran-mocks-justice-convicts-sentences-american-pastor-saeed">convicted and sentenced</a> [ACLJ report] Abedini after allowing his lawyer one day in court to put on a defense, which was also the only day of the trial Abedini and his lawyer were permitted to attend. The evidence provided by the prosecution was of Abedini's Christian activities in the early 2000s, when house churches were not perceived as such a threat to Iran's national security. Prior to the announcing of the verdict the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/203286.htm">condemned</a> [press release] "Iran's continued violation of the universal rights of freedom of religion" and called on the Iranian authorities to respect Adebini's human rights and release him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the bill does not specifically identify Islamic law, critics argue that the bill's only purpose is to invoke anti-Muslim sentiments since the US Constitution already supersedes foreign law. In an <a href="https://cair.capwiz.com/cair/issues/alert/?alertid=62779906">action alert</a> [text] urging McCrory to veto the bill, the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] stated "The bill itself is intended to marginalize and stigmatize North Carolina Muslims and will have a negative impact on the rights of people of all faiths and backgrounds." In a <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130823/governor-mccrory-takes-action-legislation"> statement</a> [press release] Friday, McCrory deemed the law "unnecessary," but revealed that he would allow the bill to become law without his signature. 

<p>Anti-Sharia legislation has been proposed in 30 states and adopted by seven including North Carolina. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Oklahoma <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2013/08/17/u-s-judge-bars-oklahoma-from-implementing-anti-sharia-law/">barred the state</a> [Reuters report] from adding a measure to its constitution that would ban state courts from considering Sharia under any circumstances, stating that it would violate the freedom of religion provisions in the US Constitution.  In June Missouri Governor Jay Nixon <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-04/national/39737152_1_missouri-governor-jay-nixon-foreign-adoptions-shariah">vetoed a similar bill</a> [WP report], asserting that the legislation would make it harder for families to adopt children from overseas. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to AI, a 1999 UN resolution charged the UNMIK with protecting and promoting human rights in Kosovo in accordance with "internationally recognized standards of human rights." AI asserts that "widespread" and "systematic" government abductions and murders after the war likely constituted crimes against humanity. Based on more than a decade of research and more than 150 complaints, AI contends that the UNMIK "signally failed" to investigate potential criminal liability, leading to a "climate of impunity" that persists in Kosovo.

<p>Tensions remain high between the Kosovo and Serbia since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, partly due to Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo as an independent nation.

The individuals are being investigated under a new legal theory, which argues that a person who served in a death camp can be charged as an accessory to murder. Prosecutor Kurt Schrimm <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/probe-50-auschwitz-suspects-near-complete">reported</a> [AP report] that the prosecutors' office plans on recommending charges against most of the individuals who have been investigated and who are still alive. State prosecutors will then determine if there is enough evidence against the individuals to officially press charges. 

<p>German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the Holocaust. Last month Laszlo Csatary, a 98-year-old Hungarian man charged with the unlawful execution and torture of people in connection with the Holocaust, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-dies-awaiting-trial.php">died</a> [JURIST report] after suffering a number of medical problems. Hungarian prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hungary-prosecutors-charge-accused-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged Csatary with war crimes</a> [JURIST report] in June, just prior to his death. In July a German state court announced that it will require 92-year-old Siert Bruins, a former member of the <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007405">Nazi Waffen SS</a> [USHMM backgrounder], to go on trial in September after Bruins was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-nazi-for-1944-killing.php">charged for the murder</a> [JURIST report] of resistance fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in 1944. In May German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Alan Malott stated in his ruling that the refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses continues an "unfortunate, intolerable pattern" of discrimination against same-sex couples. County clerks in three of the state's 33 counties have now been <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/26/new-mexico-gay-marriage/2703625/">ordered to grant marriage licenses</a> [AP report] to same-sex couples wishing to obtain one. It is uncertain what impact, if any, the ruling will have on the state's other 30 counties. Regarding Monday's ruling and Tuesday's order, executive director of the <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] Peter Simonson <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/nm-judge-orders-bernalillo-and-santa-fe-county-clerks-to-issue-marriage-licenses-to-same-sex-couples/2013/08/">stated</a> [ACLU news release], "Our state is now on the brink of joining the growing list of states who live and honor the values of family, liberty and love. Every family in this state is made richer by this step toward justice for all."

<p>New Mexico is the most recent state to take legal action regarding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the wake of the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Last week the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">will consider whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts. In July the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. In March Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted in favor of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize civil unions in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The "Sponsored Stories" program shared with a user's Facebook friends when a user clicked "like" on particular advertisers and generally included a user's name and profile picture. The settlement concerned five plaintiffs who filed a class action against Facebook in 2011, accusing Facebook of appropriating the names, photographs and identities of users through the "Sponsored Stories" program to advertise products to users, all without their explicit permission. The <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/10/revisedfacebooksettlement.pdf">settlement terms</a> require Facebook to pay $20 million to compensate class members and to give users more control over how Facebook shares user content. Children's rights groups argue that the settlement does not go far enough in protecting the rights of children.

<p>Judge Richard Seeborg <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-rejects-facebook-class-action-settlement-agreement.php">initially rejected</a> [JURIST report] Facebook's proposed settlement over the "Sponsored Stories" program. Seeborg refused to grant preliminary approval of the settlement, which provided for changes to Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and for $10 million in <em>cy pres</em> payments to be shared among advocacy groups for children, consumers and electronic privacy, but not with Facebook users themselves. Seeborg also expressed concern over a settlement provision that allowed payments of up to $10 million in attorney's fees, but again excluded the users who made up the class of injured parties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclunebraska.org/images/attachments/180_Complaint%20FILE%20STAMPED.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] was filed at a state court in Lincoln on behalf of three same-sex couples who claim the policy violates their right to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. The ban also prohibits gay and lesbian individuals from becoming adoptive parents, since the Nebraska policy requires an adoptive parent to first be licensed as a foster parent. The ACLU stated:<blockquote>Every major children's health and welfare professional group&#8212;including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association and the Child Welfare League of America&#8212;recognizes that over 25 years of scientific research shows that parents' sexual orientation has no relevance to parenting ability or the well-being of children.</blockquote>There are currently more than 3,800 children in Nebraska's foster care system.  

<p>The legal controversy over same-sex marriage has also implicated debate over the <a href="/feature/2013/07/adoption-and-parental-rights.php">parental and adoption rights of same-sex couples</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In May French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/france-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption-bill.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to legislation legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing the right of same-sex couples to adopt. Earlier that week Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/brazil-justice-council-effectively-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">effectively legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage in a court ruling that prevented notaries from denying to perform ceremonies for same-sex couples. Also that month same-sex marriage legislation was approved in the US states of <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Minnesota</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Delaware</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports].

Last month the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/uae-court-sentences-69-activists-charged-in-coup-plot.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a group of 69 people to prison for associating with the <a href="http://www.al-islah.net/">Reform and Social Guidance Association</a> (al-Islah) [advocacy website, in Arabic], a group charged with plotting to overthrow the government. A coalition consisting of the <a href="http://gc4hr.org/">Gulf Centre for Human Rights</a>, the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/">Arab Network for Human Rights Information</a> and the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> [advocacy websites] found the trial deeply flawed and "marred by recurrent and serious breaches of internationally agreed standards of fair trial." The report concludes that the failure to meet international legal standards has led to 69 unfair convictions of those exercising rights to freedom of expression, the dismissal of credible allegations of torture and the imposition of lengthy prison terms without giving them the right to appeal. The four organizations urged UAE authorities to initiate an impartial investigation of the allegations of torture, as well as an independent investigation into the conduct of the trial. 

<p>UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. In late April rights groups called on the UAE to stop the <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST report] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text].

Last week Israeli authorities began the demolition of structures lacking building permits in six locations. Inhabitants were ordered to evacuate immediately or risk high monetary fines. According to OHCHR spokesperson Cecile Pouilly, the permanent removal of families, without offering alternative housing or options, may amount to a violation of the prohibition to forcibly transfer individuals or communities under article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as "the prohibition of forced eviction under international human rights law, and the right to adequate housing and freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family and home." The OHCHR urged Israeli authorities to investigate all cases of forced eviction, hold accountable all those responsible for violations and publish its findings on the matter. 

<p>Conflicts between Israel and Palestine continue to raise concern of possible human rights violations. In June a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-palestinian-rights-violations.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Israeli efforts to mask violations of Palestinian rights. In March a UN rights experts called for Israel to cease all settlement activity and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-withdraw-settlers-from-palestinian-territories.php">immediately withdraw settlers</a> [JURIST report] from Palestinian territories due to the possibility of human rights abuses. In December the UN called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">implement and support</a> [JURIST report] the conflict-ending cease fire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. Last August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] the alleged mistreatment of two Palestinian prisoners currently on hunger strike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

By designating mosques as "terrorism enterprises," the AP claims the NYPD allowed police to spy on imams and mosque attendees without any specific evidence of criminal activity. According to the AP report, the NYPD's terrorism enterprise investigations or <a href="http://apne.ws/146zqF9">TEIs</a> [materials, PDF] have often dragged on for years even though the NYPD has never criminally charged a mosque with terrorism. The AP also obtained documents showing that the NYPD planted informants on the boards of mosques and other Muslim organizations to spy on them. <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> and <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/headquarters_co.shtml">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly</a> [official websites] have denied any wrongdoing with respect to mosque surveillance.

<p>The NYPD has faced a great deal of public pressure over its controversial surveillance and stop-and-frisk tactics. Last week JURIST guest columnist Samar Warsi of the <a href="http://www.muslimclu.org/">Muslim Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2013/08/samar-warsi-stop-frisk.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that police stops based on race are unconstitutional and symbols of corruption. Earlier in August a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text]. In June rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/rights-groups-challenge-nypd-over-muslim-surveillance.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing the NYPD of unlawfully targeting Muslims for surveillance. In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-grants-class-action-status-to-challenge-of-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy.php">granted class action status</a> [JURIST report] to a lawsuit brought to stop the NYPD from continuing its stop-and-frisk practice outside of apartment buildings in the Bronx.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Montano is <a href="http://cja.org/section.php?id=518#Pleadings">suspected</a> [CJA case backgrounder] in connection with a conspiracy with other commanders to murder six priests and two others. The case against Montano was brought as immigration fraud and perjury as a result of Montano lying about his role in the incident on his immigration forms, to which he pleaded guilty.

However, the US Government has <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ex-salvadoran-military-leader-gets-21-months-us">not decided</a> [AP report] whether to extradite to Spain.

The indictment in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] was unsealed on Tuesday after being originally issued in February. 

<p>Babafemi is the latest al Qaeda suspect involved in extradition proceedings.

This came after the extradition was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/dutch-court-approves-extradition-of-al-qaeda-suspect-to-us.php">granted and subsequently appealed</a> [JURIST report] in February. In January 2011 a British court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uk-court-approves-extradition-of-terror-suspect-to-us.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the extradition of alleged al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer to the US.

The recent decision came amid the release of <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB435/">newly declassified documents</a> [National Security Archive] by the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] earlier this month. The documents officially revealed that the CIA was involved in overthrowing then-prime minister <a href="http://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/biography/">Mohammad Mossadegh</a> [profile]. During Wednesday's session, 167 out of 196 lawmakers voted for the bill while five voted against it. Under the new bill, a special committee will review and file a report within six months. After the report, the government is planning to take legal action against the US in an international court. Proponents argued that the US government has to take responsibility for its violating Iran's rights. On the other hand, critics claimed that a legal action would merely be a waste of time without any tangible benefits.

<p>Iran has come under increased scrutiny in recent years over its record on human rights. In March the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, <a href="http://www.shaheedoniran.org/english/">Ahmed Shaheed</a> [official website] reported <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-situation-in-iran.php">continued widespread systemic violations</a> [JURIST report] of human rights in Iran, with reports from NGOs, human rights defenders and individuals presenting a situation where civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are undermined and violated in law and practice. Shaheed and El Hadji Malick Sow joined the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders to urge Iran to end its <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-to-release-detained-journalists.php">crackdown on journalists</a> [JURIST report] and release those who have been already been detained. The group called the recent arrests of journalists a "flagrant violation of Iran's obligations under international human rights law." In January a group of independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">urged Iran to stop the execution</a> [JURIST report] of five Ahwazi activists. Shaheed reasoned that these individuals should not be sentenced to death "for exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression, and affiliation to minority groups and to cultural institutions." In October the UN Special Rapporteur for Iran accused the Iranian government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report]. That same month the UN urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">stop all executions</a> [JURIST report] because the government had failed to comply with fair trial and due process guarantees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Days before entering the EU on July 1, Croatian lawmakers decided to exempt people who committed serious crimes before August 2002 from being extradited to another EU country. Known as the "Perkovic Law," <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323324904579040783045247384.html">named for alleged former spy</a> [WSJ report] Josip Perkovic who was implicated in the 1983 assassination of a Croatian dissident in Germany. The Croatian government has claimed that the act was an attempt to protect Croatian War for Independence veterans from extradition.  

<p>Croatia has previously been criticized by groups such as <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] for the slow pace of war crimes investigations. AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">noted</a> [report, PDF] that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes.

In January of this year the Croatian people <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/croatia-citizens-votes-to-join-eu.php">voted in favor</a> of joining the EU, a month after the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/croatia-signs-treaty-to-join-eu.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST reports] to finalize its EU accession. The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-gives-final-approval-to-croatia-membership.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] for Croatian membership in 2011 after six years of negotiations.

The court held that Saric was responsible for the "expulsion of the entire Bosniak population on ethnic and religious grounds." Saric's indictment was confirmed in January 2012, three months after he was taken into custody.

<p>International and national efforts to convict war criminals have been ongoing. In July the appeals chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-judges-reinstate-genocide-charges-against-karadzic.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] the acquittal of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY case summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] for a genocide charge in BiH during the Bosnian War.

He was fighting for the Army of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia when he and his men allegedly killed an enemy combatant with an AK-47, as well as kicked and beat enemy combatants with rifle stocks.

Previously, liability was only assigned to the driver that was texting. Defendant Shannon Colonna was sued for texting a driver who collided with a motorcyle less than 10 seconds after responding to her message. The trial court <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-05-25/woman-who-texted-not-liable-for-friend-s-crash-judge-says">dismissed</a> [Bloomberg report] the plaintiff's theory of proximate cause, aiding and abetting illegal activity and joint liability against Colonna in a summary judgment. However, the plaintiffs appealed and the appellate court validated all of the theories of liability against her as trial-worthy arguments. However, the court found that the plaintiffs did not procure enough evidence to indicate that Colonna knew or had special reason to know that the recipient of her message was driving, and thus again dismissed the case for her liability:<blockquote>[W]e also reject defendant's argument that a sender of text messages never has a duty to avoid texting to a person driving a vehicle. We conclude that a person sending text messages has a duty not to text someone who is driving if the texter knows, or has special reason to know, the recipient will view the text while driving.</blockquote> In response to this crash and several others, the New Jersey legislature enacted the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20120718d.html">Kulesh, Kubert, and Bolis Law</a> [press release] to <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/mcs/mcsmemo/1_10_11_finesandpen_commonmv.pdf">increase penalties</a> [text, PDF] for those drivers who cause injury while texting. Those texting the guilty drivers will be liable for all subsequent causes of action.

<p>Texting while driving has been criminalized in varying degrees in <a href="http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html">47 states</a> [GHSA summary] since 2007. Likewise, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-government-bans-texting-for.php">federal government banned texting</a> [JURIST report] for commercial drivers and federal employees in 2010. The government website <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/">Distraction.gov</a> [official website] tracks research and data results related to cell phone use while driving and provides access to state developments in penalties for related occurrences. That site features access to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/werner-herzog-documentary-texting-while-driving_n_3727386.html">documentary</a> [Huffington Post report] released this month that reviews the relative dangers caused by distracted driving. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During her recent trip, Pansieri witnessed first-hand the siege of the city Goma, including widespread rape by military and civilian offenders with impunity. In other parts of the country, she noted that the conflict threatened everyday life. As a result of this seven-day evaluation, Pansieri encouraged the UN to extend its <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/monusco/">stabilization mission</a> in the country and implored the international community to continue its support of the rule of law there. She also welcomed recent efforts to reform the penal system and protect rights defenders.

<p>Violence has continued in the DRC with government and rebel forces accused of rights abues. In July <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the rebel group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">news archive</a>]  is <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/hrw-drc-rebels-recieving-aid-from-rwanda-despite-abuses.php">receiving assistance from Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] despite continued human rights abuses by the M23, including rape, executions and forced recruitment of young boys. In May a UN report found that DRC troops <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">committed rape and murder</a> [JURIST report] as they retreated from an advance by M23 rebels last November. In February HRW reported that during the siege of Goma, M23 forces <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">summarily executed 24 individuals</a> [JURIST report], 21 of whom were civilians, and raped 36 women, including a 10-year-old girl. In November the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] M23 guerrilla attacks on the DRC and called for an immediate end to all support for the group. Last year a leaked UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">report</a> [JURIST report] revealed that Rwanda had been supporting M23 and other groups guilty of human rights violations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Offenders may be <a href="http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20130827178367">imprisoned</a> [<em>Saudi Gazette</em> report] for a term ranging from one month to a year or fines between 5,000 and 50,000 Saudi riyals (USD $1,300 to $13,333). For repeat offenders, penalties may be doubled. The new law also requires third parties knowledgeable about any violations to report to authorities. In addition to criminal sanctions, the law will also provide psychological, social and health care assistance to the victims. Domestic violence has been considered a private matter in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14702705">Saudi Arabia</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saudi+Arabia">news archive</a>]. While human rights activists praised the recent move, some are concerned about the issue of enforcement. Women in Saudi Arabia are still subject to male guardians who may be the offenders. Thus, without the reporting of male guardians, women might not be able to benefit from the new law. Moreover, law enforcement and courts have to be trained to implement and enforce the law successfully.

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for its human rights record. In July a Saudi Arabia court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-website-editor-to-7-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] the editor of a liberal website to seven years in prison and 600 lashes after finding him guilty of "founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought." In June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-saudi-arabia-should-be-condemned-for-convicting-7-facebook-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the EU's High Representative and other EU member states' representatives to condemn Saudi Arabia for convicting seven governmental critics of inciting protests through Facebook. Last December HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia to dismiss the criminal case against Raif Badawi. Earlier, in August, several international human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the Saudi Ministry of Justice seeking to observe the trials of four rights activists who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/attorney-merrill-lynch-black-financial-advisers-settle-racial-discrimination-lawsuit/2013/08/28/23211a40-0ffe-11e3-a2b3-5e107edf9897_story.html">settlement</a> [WP report] has to be approved by the Judge Robert Gettleman for the <a href="https://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website], which would close an almost decade-long case. The lawsuit was filed in 2005 alleging that Merrill Lynch prevented its black brokers from obtaining lucrative businesses, thereby reducing their pay and causing them to earn less than their white coworkers. The plaintiffs claimed that they made almost 50 percent less on average in 2006 alone and that they were shielded from career opportunities. An approval may take months, and a status hearing is scheduled for September 3.

<p>Gettleman had previously refused to give the case a class-action status. However, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] reversed the ruling in 2012 thereby reopening the case. Discrimination is an ongoing issue. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rejects-class-status-in-wal-mart-discrimination-suit.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a potential gender discrimination class action lawsuit against <a href="http://corporate.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> [corporate website].

The arrests occurred as Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23249049">Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi</a> [BBC profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013828104147603483.html">reversed his position</a> [Al Jazeera report] on the Islamist group by announcing that the government should not ban or exclude it from the political process.

<p>A Cairo court on Sunday adjourned the trial of three Muslim Brotherhood leaders, Mohammed Badie, Khairat al-Shater and Rashad Bayoumy, after the three failed to appear in court, citing security concerns. The judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/25/us-egypt-protests-idUSBRE97N0CR20130825">postponed</a> [Reuters report] the trial to October 29. Badie was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-authorities-arrest-muslim-brotherhood-leader.php">arrested</a> [JURIST news report] last week.

The bill, known as the "Legal Framework for Peace," was challenged by rights activists who claimed that by granting judicial pardons to rebels, it is "contrary to the State's duty to investigate and punish crimes, especially main violations of human rights" and that its measures to satisfy victim's rights are inadequate. In its reasoning, the court analyzed the bill's balance between the pursuit of peace and the rights of victims. In a press release, the court said, "Therefore, the State had the authority to provide reasonable transitional instruments, justified and proportionate, even limiting other constitutional guarantees, in order to achieve peace." The decision was announced the same evening that Colombian <a href="http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/En/government/Paginas/President.aspx">President Juan Manuel Santos</a> [official profile, in Spanish] announced his government's readiness to begin peace talks with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11400950">National Liberation Army</a> (ELN) [BBC backgrounder], the country's second largest left-wing rebel group.

The country has been plagued by an internal war with these rebel groups for the past five decades, and the president defended the amendment as the best chance for peace. Rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.coljuristas.org">Colombian Commission of Jurists</a> (CCJ) [advocacy website], challenged the amendment because it vests the parliament with the discretion to decide which acts of war are applicable to the justice system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seselj has consistently argued that the ICTY is biased and violating his right to a fair trial.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two men, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/us-guantanamo-bay-detainees-algeria">Nabil Said Hadjarab and Mutia Sadiq Ahmad Sayyab</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], are the first to be released from the detention center in over a year and are reported to have been participating in a hunger strike at the prison. The prisoners had been detained since 2001 and 2002, respectively, and had been approved for the release for several years, but their case was delayed because it was a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/two-algerians-released-from-guantanamo-bay/2013/08/29/635a8d2a-10a9-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">challenge to find a place</a> [WP report] that was willing or able to accept them. It is unclear whether the Algerian government will allow the men to go free or will choose to detain them. The Algerian government has ensured the US that it will not mistreat the prisoners. There are currently 164 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, 37 of whom are participating in a hunger strike. Eighty-six of the detainees have been approved for release, and the Obama administration has expressed a commitment to taking steps towards releasing those prisoners, but fears that transferring them could result in former prisoners becoming more militant, or being subjected to punishment in their home countries.  

<p>In June a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo detainee cases. Just days prior Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In his speech, he detailed the steps needed to get prisoners out of Guantanamo but cautioned that he cannot close the facility on his own. In contrast, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the 2014 <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF] in early June, which allocates more than 200 million dollars to keep the detention center open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mahama won the election with 50.7 of the vote, getting 300,000 more votes than the opposition. The opposition <a href="http://www.newpatrioticparty.org/">New Patriotic Party</a> (NPP) [party website], had <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/ghana-opposition-party-to-challenge-presidential-election.php">challenged the narrow victory</a> [JURIST report], claiming that it should be annulled on the grounds of fraud. Thursday's 5-4 decision dismissed the challenge by the NPP. The decision was delivered by Justice William Atuguba, president of the Supreme Court nine-member panel.

<p>The allegations of fraud emerged after the December election last year. Though <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gHnosJcnf9iKQhKfVVHJMYFFZ7iQ?docId=f1646992efe84f51bde90fa083a28344">Mahama was declared the winner</a> [AP report] of Ghana's December 7 election with 50.7 percent of the valid vote, opposition leaders declared that they had "serious reservations about the validity of what the Chairman of the Electoral Commission has done in declaring results that ... do not reflect the mandate of the required majority of the Ghanaian electorate." NPP leadership submitted a two-fold <a href="http://www.thenewpatrioticparty.org/index.php/press/110-press/our-press/394-re-request-for-an-audit-of-verification-machines-and-recount-of-the-presidential-ballot">request</a> [text] to the Returning Office of the President Elections. First, NPP asked for an audit of the verification machines "to establish that it tallies with Constituency Collated signed results," and second, it asked for an order to re-collate "the presidential ballot at the constituency level to help establish the credibility and accuracy" of the December 7 election. NPP's presidential candidate, <a href="http://akufoaddo2012.com/">Nana Akufo-Addo</a> [campaign website], finished second in the election with 47.74 percent of the electoral vote and encouraged all NPP members and his supporters to remain calm as they awaited today's verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This recognition is to take place for legally-married couples living in all states, including jurisdictions that do not recognize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The ruling, however, does not apply to registered domestic partnerships or civil unions. Thursday's decision has been met with both praise and criticism. <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">Freedom to Marry</a> [advocacy website] lauded the decision, calling it a <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/treasury-dept.-married-same-sex-couples-will-be-respected-for-federal-tax-p">victory</a> [press release] for the rights of same-sex couples. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.nationformarriage.org/">National Organization of Marriage</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.nomblog.com/37492">criticized</a> [press release] the Obama administration for overstepping its boundaries in a nation where "only Congress has the authority to change the law."

<p>Thursday's announcement follows the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] which overturned Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA). The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. A judge for the <a href="http://seconddistrictcourt.nmcourts.gov/">Second Judicial District Court of New Mexico</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-mexico-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] district court clerks to begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Last week the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">consider whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts. In July the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage. In March Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted in favor of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize civil unions in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Repassy stated that the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/hungary-make-more-changes-new-constitution">amendments would contain</a> [AP report] new rules on the recognition of religious groups, as well as modifications to the bans on political advertisements on commercial television and radio stations. The new laws will allow political campaign advertisements on commercial TV and radio, but broadcasters will not be allowed to charge for them. Political parties will also be given equal air time. Parliament will still retain the right to designate recognized churches, though all religious communities will be allowed to function as churches. Recognized churches may be granted tax breaks and other advantages. Before the 2012 amendments, all churches in Hungary received these benefits. Repassy stated that the amendments were proposed as the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/08/29/hungary-to-amend-constitution-to-quell-eu-criticism/">result of pressure</a> [WSJ report] due to the harsh criticism Hungary has received.

<p>The controversial 2012 amendments include <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-experts-criticize-hungary-law-criminalizing-homelessness.php">restrictions on the homeless</a> [JURIST report], increased control of the media and a strict, narrow definition of family. The new laws were controversial <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-controversial-constitutional-amendments.php">even when they were passed</a> [JURIST report], and have been subject to ongoing scrutiny. In June UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-human-rights-chief-urges-hungary-to-revoke-constitutional-amendments.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Hungarian government to revoke the 2012 constitutional amendments, stating that they undermine the country's constitutional justice and threaten the independence of the country's judiciary. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported that the country's new constitution <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hungary-laws-undermining-human-rights-hrw.php">undermines basic human rights</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two federal judges have split on the issue, with one <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-california-law-banning-sexual-orientation-change-therapy.php">blocking</a> the law's enforcement and another <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-california-sexual-orientation-change-therapy-ban.php">refusing to issue an injunction</a> [JURIST reports]. The Ninth Circuit ruled Thursday on appeals from both cases, holding, "SB 1172, as a regulation of professional conduct, does not violate the free speech rights of ["sexual orientation change efforts"] practitioners or minor patients, is neither vague nor overbroad, and does not violate parents' fundamental rights." Many groups, including the <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice Institute</a> [advocacy website],  have <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/1/post/2013/08/-9th-circuit-deals-major-blow-to-free-speech-religious-freedom.html">criticized</a> [press release] the ruling, asserting that the law impedes on rights of free speech and religious freedom. The court, however, determined that the law regulates professional conduct rather than speech. Furthermore, to combat allegations that the law infringes upon the rights of parents, the panel stated that "parents do not have the right to choose a specific type of provider for a specific medical or mental health treatment that the state has reasonably deemed harmful." Violators of this law will face disciplinary action from their licensing authority.

<p>California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed the bill</a> [JURIST report] in October, making California the first state to pass a law banning this type of therapy. The bill was supported by the <a href="http://www.naswca.org/">National Association of Social Workers</a>, California Chapter, the <a href="http://aamftca.org/">American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy</a>, California Division, the <a href="http://www.apsa.org/">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbs.ca.gov/">California Board of Behavioral Sciences</a> [advocacy websites]. SB 1172 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> at the end of last August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate </a>[JURIST reports] in May of last year. Supporters of the bill asserted that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and should not be treated as such. Furthermore, therapies and efforts to reverse homosexuality were found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> [advocacy website] voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts relied on in the bill are generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy have highlighted a <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cole said that priorities of particular importance to the government include preventing marijuana distribution to minors, revenue to criminal enterprises and diversion to states where the drug remains illegal. This guidance is a change from the administration's previous policy that federal enforcement was appropriate for large-scale, for-profit commercial enterprises but not for medicinal use by those seriously ill. Cole stated:<blockquote>[B]oth the existence of a strong and effective state regulatory system, and an operation's compliance with such a system, may allay the threat that an operation's size poses to federal enforcement interests. Accordingly, in exercising prosecutorial discretion, prosecutors should not consider the size or commercial nature of marijuana operation alone as a proxy for assessing whether marijuana trafficking implicates the Department's enforcement priorities.</blockquote>Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, pursuant to the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm">Controlled Substances Act</a> [text].

Due to the financial strain, some staff have not been paid in months and are now <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/khmer-rouge-tribunal-staff-threatens-strike/1739563.html">threatening to strike</a> [VOA report]. The Khmer Rouge tribunal is backed by the UN and <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/finances">receives its funding</a> [official website] solely from voluntary contributions.

<p>The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">deaths of some 1.7 million people</a> [PPU backgrounder] from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979. The ECCC was established in 2001 to investigate and try those responsible for the Cambodian genocide that resulted in the deaths of approximately one-third of the Cambodian population. In June 2011 the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial-of-former-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">began hearings</a> [JURIST report] for four former leaders of Khmer Rouge.

Ieng Thirith and Ieng Sary were also arrested and charged in September 2007, though Sary <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/cambodia-khmer-rouge-foreign-minister-dies-while-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">died</a> while on trial and Thirith has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-releases-former-khmer-rouge-leader.php">released</a> [JURIST reports]. The other defendant <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC profile] is a former head of state.

Tracey Cooper-Harris, a 12-year Army veteran, sued the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) after it denied her fully disability benefits because she is married to a woman. In light of the June 26 Supreme Court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">striking down</a> [JURIST report] Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text, PDF], the court found that the denial of benefits to same-sex spouses is not rationally related to any military purpose and enjoined the VA from relying on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/101">Title 38</a> [text] to exclude Cooper-Harris' marriage that was legally recognized by the state. 

<p>Earlier this month the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced that it will <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=120621">extend benefits to same-sex couples</a> [press release]. Likewise, those couples stationed in a jurisdiction that will not provide a valid marriage certificate to same-sex couples will be <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16203">granted leave</a> [press release] to obtain a license and certificate. All benefits will be retroactive to the date of the ruling for current members who provide a valid certificate. Benefits are set to begin on or before September 3. The DOD has steadily increased benefits to same-sex couples since the revocation of <a href="feature/featured/dadt/">Don't Ask Don't Tell</a>  [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The revised law <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324009304579043252553843902.html">applied</a> [WSJ report] to government employees deemed redundant and that had been unemployed for more than 12 months. The law gave such employees the choice of either staying in training facilities without pay or leaving government employment and collecting unemployment benefits. The change was expected to trim the public payroll by &#8364;167 million (USD $222 million) through 2015. The court ruled the new provisions were unconstitutional, holding that the law violated guarantees of secure employment and undermined the trust between employer and employee. The Portuguese government must reduce the nations budget deficit to four percent as a condition of the &#8364;78 billion bailout the nation <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13275470">received</a> [BBC report] in 2011 from the EU and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website]. 

<p>Portugal is one of many European states struggling to recover from financial crisis of 2008. In April the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/portugal-court-finds-provisions-of-2013-budget-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that four out of nine contested austerity measures of the 2013 state budget were unconstitutional. The court's decision came in response to the request of Portugal's <a href="http://www.presidencia.pt/?idc=3&idl=2">President Anibal Cavaco Silva</a> [official website] for the court to determine whether retirees and public workers were being treated unfairly under the terms of the country's constitution. In November the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_6999/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the ESM, is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/latif_v_holder_opinion_and_order.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that those placed on the US government's no-fly list have "a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in traveling internationally by air, which is affected by being placed on the No Fly List." The plaintiffs in the case are 13 US citizens who were denied boarding on flights over US air space after January 2009. The plaintiffs have asserted that the current process available to the them through the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] does not provide a hearing at which an individual can present evidence to contest his or her inclusion on the no-fly list, and is therefore, unconstitutional. The government has contended that the DHS system in place is sufficient in light of the government's interest in national security. Judge Anna Brown has not concluded whether the government's use of the no-fly list violated the plaintiffss constitutional rights to due process, stating in her opinion that, "the court is not yet able to resolve on the current record whether the judicial-review process is a sufficient, post-deprivation process under the United States Constitution." Brown has given both parties till September 9 to file a joint status report setting out their recommendation as to the most effective process to ensure that the court may come to a conclusion on the remaining issues.

<p>The no-fly list was created by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/nsb/tsc/tsc_mission">Terrorist Screening Center</a> (TSC), a branch of the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official websites], in 2003. The TSC was established by <a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=441949">Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6</a> [text] which, "directed that a center be established to consolidate the government's approach to terrorism screening and to provide for the appropriate and lawful use of terrorist information in screening processes." In 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/ninth-circuit-reinstates-no-fly-list-challenge.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] a challenge brought by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] over the no-fly list maintained by the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Safety Administration</a> (TSA) [official website]. The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2008 that those placed on the government's no-fly list can challenge their <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ninth-circuit-rules-people-on-no-fly.php">inclusion on the list</a> [JURIST report] in federal district courts. The court held that the TSC, which actually maintains the list, is a subsection of the FBI and is therefore subject to review by the district courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although she acknowledged the achievements made by the Sri Lankan government in terms of resettlement, reconstruction and rehabilitation since the end of its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">26-year civil war</a> [JURIST backgrounder] with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder], Pillay stated that physical reconstruction alone "will not bring reconciliation, dignity, or lasting peace." Pillay has expressed particular concern with the curtailment and denial of personal freedoms and human rights, claiming these limitations threaten democracy and the rule of law in the country. 

<p>The UN and other international human rights groups have urged Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes committed during its civil war with the LTTE. Earlier this week, at the beginning of her visit, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-visits-sri-lanka-to-investigate-war-crimes-allegations.php">pledged to raise concerns</a> [JURIST report] with the government's human rights record, particularly with regard to alleged war crimes against ethnic Tamils. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-no-progress-in-sri-lanka-since-civil-war-ended.php">there has been no progress</a> [JURIST report] regarding respect for basic rights and liberties in the four years since the end of the country's civil war. In March the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-body-adopts-resolution-on-sri-lanka.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. In February Sri Lankan authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">accused of using rape</a> [JURIST report] as a method of interrogating members or supporters of the LTTE. Earlier that same month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized Sri Lanka</a> for failing to investigate war crimes, and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-pushes-un-for-independent-investigation-of-sri-lanka-rights-abuses.php">pushed</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent investigation of rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The experts noted that these individuals are often targets of threats and reprisals. Because of this, the group is urging states to do more to criminalize and punish this type of intimidation and persecution. In addition, a lack of funding for NGO's fighting on behalf of victims and their families has made it hard for these organizations to continue serving their communities. These experts further called upon states to renew their commitment to supporting these key organizations. 

<p>Enforced disappearances remain prevalent despite the UN's 1992 <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/%28Symbol%29/A.RES.47.133.En?OpenDocument">declaration</a> [text]. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/02/mali-should-prosecute-soldiers-for-abuses-hrw.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Mali to prosecute soldiers who participate in violence against civilians, including alleged enforced disappearance. That same day, HRW released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mexico-security-forces-participated-in-forced-disappearances-hrw.php">report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the use of enforced disappearances by Mexican security forces. In December the president of the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-president-signs-law-criminalizing-enforced-disappearances.php">signed a law</a> [JURIST report] that criminalized enforced disappearance. Last September the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-concerned-over-enforced-disappearances-in-pakistan.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over enforced disappearances in Pakistan. In August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-urges-balkan-authorities-to-investigate-disappearances.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] authorities in the former Yugoslavia to investigate the enforced disappearances of 14,000 people who are still unaccounted for since the civil war of the 1990s. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23916752#"">said</a> [BBC report] he has not made a final determination on the response but noted that a response could come in the near future. Speculation on the likelihood of military action in Syria following Syria's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/30/government-assessment-syrian-government-s-use-chemical-weapons-august-21">reported use</a> [White House briefing] of chemical weapons earlier this month. The US claims its intelligence reports support the conclusion the attacks were carried out by Syrian forces and military action would be used to deter the future use of chemical weapons. Controversy continues to surround Obama's legal authority to take action prior to Congressional approval. In addition, some Congressional leaders <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/31/us-syria-crisis-usa-idUSBRE97T0NB20130831">claim</a> [Reuters report] they still require more information to be declassified before a meaningful debate can take place. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is among those who have <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/letter_to_president_re_syria_08.30.13.pdf">called</a> [text, PDF] for Obama to delay military action until Congress has approved the measure.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian civil war</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. This week the UK <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/uk-government-outlines-legal-justification-for-possible-strike-on-syria.php">outlined</a> [JURIST report] the legal justifications for military action in Syria. Last week, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-syria-chemical-weapon-use-would-constitute-a-crime-against-humanity.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the escalating violence in Syria and noted the use of chemical weapons constitues a crime against humanity. His statements came days after the UN rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Syria's reported use of chemical weapons. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

More than 250 staff members, including judges, prosecutors and interpreters, have not been paid since June of this year because of budgetary problems. The Khmer Rouge tribunal is backed by the UN and <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/finances">receives its funding</a> [official website] solely from voluntary contributions. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-needs-funding.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] international donors to provide financial support to keep the tribunal running. The court is currently <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/khmer-rouge-tribunal-staff-threatens-strike/1739563.html">preparing to prosecute</a> [VOA New report] high-level Khmer Rouge leaders <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC profiles], both of whom are charged with war crimes. According to media sources, the strike may affect the progress already made in the trials. Khmer Rouge tribunal workers also went on strike in March for unpaid wages.

<p>The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for the <ahref="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">deaths of some 1.7 million people</a> [PPU backgrounder] from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979. The ECCC was established in 2001 to investigate and try those responsible for the Cambodian genocide, which resulted in the deaths of approximately one-third of the Cambodian population. In June 2011 the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial-of-former-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">began hearings</a> [JURIST report] for four former leaders of Khmer Rouge. Nuon Chea was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/ex-khmer-rouge-second-in-command.php">arrested and charged</a> in September 2007 and said that he was never in the position to order the deaths attributed to him but that he would <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/khmer-rouge-tribunal-expects.php">cooperate with the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports]. Ieng Thirith and Ieng Sary were also arrested and charged in September 2007, though Sary <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/cambodia-khmer-rouge-foreign-minister-dies-while-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">died while on trial</a> and Thirith has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-releases-former-khmer-rouge-leader.php">released</a> [JURIST reports].

The investigation stems from Jiemin's alleged involvement in an undisclosed <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1301001/head-china-state-assets-regulator-and-former-oil-major-chief-under-graft">"serious discipline violation"</a> [<em>South China Morning Post</em> report].

Sources alleged that Jiemin used his position to transfer large sums of money to prevent details of a car crash that killed a top official's son from leaking to the public. Authorities have yet to indicate whether the CNPC investigation is related to its current investigation of Jiemin.

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform its judicial system and combat corruption. In July China's former Communist Party leader Bo Xilai was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-communist-party-leader-formally-charged-with-corruption.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] with corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power. Also in July Chinese activist and lawyer Xu Zhiyong was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-authorities-detain-anti-corruption-activist-xu-zhiyong.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by Chinese authorities on suspicion of having "gathered crowds to disrupt public order." In March 2012 the President and Chief Justice of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) told the National People's Congress (NPC) that the country must <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-chief-judge-urges-courts-to-continue-legal-reforms.php">continue to implement legal reform</a> [JURIST report] to combat corruption and foster social and economic growth. A former Chinese corruption official was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-official-executed.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in December 2010 for accepting more than 4.7 million USD in bribes. China's chief administrative authority, the State Council, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-releases-anti-corruption-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] in December 2010 outlining steps to fight corruption and build a cleaner government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Krajisnik, arrested in 2000, was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">convicted in 2006</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] for the persecution, deportation and forcible transfer of civilians from their homes during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnia+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icty-grants-release-to-former-head-of-the-bosnian-serb-parliament.php">granted early release</a> [JURIST report] to Krajisnik in July, based partially upon evidence of Krajisnik's rehabilitation during his time in prison. Non-Serbs in Bosnia were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/bosnian-serbs-welcome-released-war-criminal-momcilo-krajisnik-home-as-a-hero/2013/08/30/8ce8d93e-119f-11e3-a2b3-5e107edf9897_story.html">outraged</a> [AP report] by Krajisnik's welcome, which included people waving Serb flags through windows, honking horns and stopping at the main square, where Serbian nationalists songs were blaring from loudspeakers.

<p>The ICTY had denied three of Krajisnik's previous requests for early release, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icty-rejects-former-serb-parliament-speakers-request-for-early-release.php">most recently</a> [JURIST report] last November.

At Krajisnik's 2006 trial, the ICTY found him not guilty on a charge of genocide, for which prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/icty-prosecutors-seek-life-sentence.php">requested a life sentence</a>, but still <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">sentenced him to 27 years</a> [JURIST reports] imprisonment for various other war crimes. Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive], with whom Krajisnik worked closely, was also <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> in 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/karadzic-opens-defense-before-icty.php">currently faces war crimes charges</a> [JURIST reports] before the ICTY.

Mississippi <a href="http://www.governorbryant.com/">Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official website] <a href="http://meridianstar.com/local/x2045492102/Concealed-carry-law-clarified">signed the bill into law</a> [<em>Meridian Star</em> report] in March, and it was set to take effect in July. However, Circuit Court Judge Winston Kidd <a href="http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2013/06/judge_blocks_mississippi_open-.html">issued an injunction</a> [AP report] in June, ruling that the law was unconstitutionally vague and that an injunction was needed "to prevent irreparable harm." The Mississippi Supreme Court <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323324904579045103304360002.html">overruled the judgment</a> [AP report], allowing the law to finally take effect, stating that the lower court erred when he stated that a "reasonable person reading the bill could not discern what the law allows and what it prohibits." Even with the open carry law to take effect, previous laws banning guns on schools and college campuses, and in government and other public buildings, are still in effect.

<p>The lifting of the injunction on House Bill 2 is the latest development in the national gun control debate. In August Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/illinois-governor-signs-gun-control-bill-into-law.php">signed a gun safety bill into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring background checks for all gun purchases in the state as well as the reporting of all lost and stolen guns. In May several groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/connecticut-gun-control-law-challenged-in-federal-court.php">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the constitutionality of a new Connecticut gun control law expanding the definition of "assault weapons," which are banned under existing state law. Earlier that month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-warns-kansas-on-new-gun-law.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Kansas that a recently enacted law intended to block enforcement of federal gun regulations was unconstitutional. In March a Kansas legislative committee approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kansas-lawmakers-approve-open-carry-and-transportation-law-for-firearms.php">allow the open carry</a> [JURIST report] and transport of firearms around the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In February 1997, Turkey's secular National Security Council allegedly met and voted to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/09/20139263211650439.html">impose strict rules</a> [Al Jazeera report] limiting Islamist education in order to force pro-Islam Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to step down from office. In 1998, the council won a legal battle in the nation's high court effectively banning any affiliation with Erbakan's political party. Two of Erbakan's ministers then co-founded the Justice and Development Party, which has remained in power after winning three general elections since 2002. The coup is known as the "post modern coup" because the plotters did not use military force to overthrow the government, but instead used pressure through workings within the government. Prosecutor Mustafa Bilgili's 1,300 page indictment <a href="http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&ArticleID=116715">charges</a> [World Bulletin report] former-Army chief General Ismail Hakki Karadayi and former-Generals Cevik Bir, Cetin Dogan, Erdal Ceylanoglu, and Engin Alan. The prosecution has reportedly asked the court to hand down life sentences for those allegedly involved.

<p>The 1997 "post modern coup" was the fourth military overthrow that occurred in Turkey in 40 years. In April, the Ankara 12th High Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/turkish-court-begins-trial-of-1980-military-coup-leaders.php">began its trial</a> [JURIST report] of the last two surviving leaders of Turkey's 1980 coup, former general Kenan Evren and former air force commander Tahsin Sahinkaya. That coup led to three years of military rule, during which 50 people were hanged and a half million were arrested. The trial of those two individuals came after the court accepted the indictment against them in January based on charges <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-ex-president-faces-possible-life-sentence-for-1980-military-coup.php">pressed</a> [JURIST reports] by the prosecution a week earlier. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences against both men in the ongoing trial, which was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/22/us-turkey-trial-evren-idUSBRE8AL0W520121122">delayed</a> [Reuters report] in January to allow the prosecution to seek more evidence. Both men suffer from severe health issues due to their ages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In August 2012, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">issued a declaration</a> [JURIST report] granting himself complete legislative and executive power. The declaration and subsequent rulings resulted in political and social discord and massive, protracted public demonstration. According to the prosecution, Morsi and other high-level Brotherhood members <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20130901-egypt-morsi-stand-trial-inciting-murder?ns_campaign=editorial&ns_source=RSS_public&ns_mchannel=RSS&ns_fee=0&ns_linkname=20130901_egypt_morsi_stand_trial_inciting_murder">incited their supporters</a> [AFP report] to murder at least 10 protesters during a violent demonstration outside the presidential palace in December. The prosecution referred the case to trial in an Egyptian criminal court but the timeframe for the proceedings has not yet been determined. The charges are the latest move in a concerted effort to subdue the Brotherhood and restore order to the state.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] Morsi, in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. Last month, the Egyptian prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-pm-proposes-legal-dissolution-of-muslim-brotherhood.php">proposed formally dissolving</a> [JURIST report] the non-governmental organization registration of the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to force the group underground. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities </a>[JURIST report] in July to address the escalating violence that followed Morsi's ousting. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website]. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Adly Mansour, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state on the same day that Morsi was deposed and has been acting in that capacity since then.

Following the analysis, a report will be given to Ban, who will then share the results with all permanent and non-permanent member states of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website]. The investigation is expected to uncover impartial, scientific facts relating to any prior use of chemical weapons. Ban requested that inspectors speed up the chemical analysis process due to the magnitude of the alleged attack, but only to the extent that they can still guarantee the accuracy of the results will not be affected. Two Syrian officials are observing the investigation to verify the credibility of the work and findings are expected to be available within the next two weeks. Ban plans to brief the members of the Security Council sometime this week, possibly as early as Tuesday.

<p>Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=7034">condemned</a> [news release] the escalating violence in Syria, insisting that any use of chemical weapons would constitute a crime against humanity with "serious results for the perpetrator." Ban's statement follows UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay's</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of the reported chemical weapon attacks and reaffirmed the UN goal of achieving "complete cessation of hostilities, delivering humanitarian assistance and getting the Government and the opposition to the negotiating table in Geneva as soon as possible."  Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in May regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. More than 100,000 people have been killed, almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced since the fighting began.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Egyptian government reportedly <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/03/egypt-court-bans-local-al-jazeera-station-over-accusations-that-it-is-pro-muslim-brotherhood/">claims</a> [AP report] that Al-Jazeera's affiliate provided biased news coverage during Brotherhood protests following the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">removal</a> [JURIST report] of president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] in July. Authorities claim Al Jazeera has also displayed recorded messages from high-level Brotherhood members in the past few weeks. The other banned stations include a news group tied to the Islamist group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive], an Islamist media source based in Jordan, and a news channel tied directly to the Brotherhood called Ahrar 25. These closures are the latest move in a concerted effort to subdue the Brotherhood and restore order to the state.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military deposed Morsi, in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. Last month the Egyptian prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-pm-proposes-legal-dissolution-of-muslim-brotherhood.php">proposed formally dissolving</a> [JURIST report] the non-governmental organization registration of the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to force the group underground. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities</a> [JURIST report] in July to address the escalating violence that followed Morsi's ousting. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as Amnesty International. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Adly Mansour, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state on the same day that Morsi was deposed and has been acting in that capacity since then. According to the OHCHR more than 80 people have been killed and over 1000 injured since political turmoil gripped the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors accuse Bruins of <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/92-year-old-trial-nazi-war-crime">executing</a> [AP report] captured Dutch Nazi-opposition fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 outside the town of Appingedam. Bruins and an accomplice, who has since died, are accused of taking Dijkema, a prisoner at the time, to an isolated location and then shooting him four times. The suspects reported at the time that Dijkema had been trying to escape when they shot him. Bruins, who was born Dutch but is now a German citizen, was sentenced to prison in the 1980s for the murder of two Dutch Jews during the Second World War. Trial sessions are reportedly limited to three hour periods in light of Bruins' age. If convicted, Bruins would likely face a life sentence. 

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to arrest individuals charged with war crimes during the Holocaust. In June Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hungary-prosecutors-charge-accused-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Laszlo Csatary, a 98-year-old Hungarian man, with the unlawful execution and torture of people in connection with the Holocaust. Csatary <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-dies-awaiting-trial.php">died</a> [JURIST report] last month while awaiting trial. In May German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp. German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the Holocaust.

Regarding the pending charges, Menem has stated that he meant no harm by falsifying his tax returns. If convicted, he could face up to six years in prison.

<p>In addition to his pending charges and June conviction, Menem was also put on trial in 2011 for crimes committed during his presidency. Menem was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/argentina-ex-president-cabinet-members.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the Federal Court in 2009 on corruption charges for overpaying members of his administration during 1988 and 1989.

Menem, who was born in Argentina to Syrian immigrants, was accused of hiding the alleged involvement of Syrian-Argentine businessman Alberto Kanoore Edul. Numerous members of his administration have also faced a variety of charges over the past decade, but few have been convicted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Parliamentary Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20130903-kenya-vote-world-court-pullout-before-trials">ordered a special sitting</a> [AFP report] of the assembly for Thursday. Even if Kenya votes to leave the ICC, it would not affect the trials of Ruto, as those proceedings have already begun. Additionally, although parliament is expected to debate and vote on departing the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute of the ICC</a> [text], but withdrawal requires formally submitting a request to theUN and would take at least a year. Kenya would be the first country to leave the ICC. On Tuesday, the ICC trial opens for Ruto on three counts of crimes against humanity that led to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and displacement of over 600,000. On November 12, the trial of <a href="http://www.uhuru.co.ke/">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [official website] on five charges of crimes against humanity will open in The Hague. 

<p>In July the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to change the forum of their trials to Kenya or Tanzania. The defense request was filed in January under articles 3(3) and 62 of the Rome Statute and Rule 100 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Documents/RulesProcedureEvidenceEng.pdf#page=47">ICC Rules and Procedures of Evidence</a> [text, PDF], which provide for in situ hearings. Kenyatta and Ruto's trials were recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/kenya-presidents-war-crimes-trial-postponed.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until the fall. African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that current Kenyatta and Vice President Ruto be tried in Kenya after the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Kenyan Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] connecting Kenyatta and Ruto to the post-election violence. Earlier in May Kenya's ambassador to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed. Even with charges for crimes against humanity pending against him, Kenyatta was able to win a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency in March. Kenyatta was sworn in as the country's fourth president <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">following a ruling</a> [JURIST report] from Kenya's Supreme Court that the election results were in fact valid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Formally endorsed by the Somali cabinet last week, the roadmap will institutionalize the protection and promotion of human rights through 2015. However, Bari urged the government to consult with regional administrations and civil society organizations throughout Somalia in the finalization of the roadmap, otherwise, Bari noted, implementation may be difficult. "The endorsement of a Human Rights Roadmap no doubt raises high expectation of Federal Government to ensure that perpetrators of human rights abuses are held accountable." The roadmap enumerates 17 rights, each containing an action plan to be implemented by key ministries, including the newly created Ministry of Human Rights. 

<p>Human rights violations have been a continued concern in Somalia. In April Bari <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-expert-somalia-should-strengthen-justice-system-following-attacks.php">urged</a> the Somali government to continue efforts to strengthen the country's justice system after the Supreme Court complex was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/somalia-supreme-court-attacked-by-al-shabaab-radicals.php">attacked</a> [JURIST reports] by al-Shabaab radicals. In March Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that displaced people in Somalia face the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/displaced-people-in-somalia-face-abuse-and-rape-hrw.php">risk of physical abuse</a> [JURIST report] and rape. HRW noted that the threat of beatings and rape from internal security forces was significant and called for the practices to end. According to HRW, "Instead of finding a safe haven from fighting and famine, many displaced Somalis who came to Mogadishu have found hostility and abuse." Also in March a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiff argued on behalf of a class that Apple thwarted competition by issuing software updates that prevent syncing functionality with certain non-Apple media players while charging supracompetitive prices music prices. However, the court held that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a plausible antitrust injury. Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge Milan Smith, Jr. stated that the plaintiff's own allegations did not square with her overcharge theory because the price of music downloads has remained unchanged. "If Somers' overcharge theory were correct, then Apple's music prices from 2004 to 2008 were supracompetitive as a result of software updates that excluded competition, and the emergence of a large seller ... would have caused ... music prices to fall. But Somers alleges no such price reduction."

The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Macmillan and Penguin Group (USA) Inc. conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. Last month a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/apple-denied-suspension-of-its-antitrust-conviction.php">denied Apple's request</a> [JURIST report] for a temporary suspension of the court's July ruling that Apple violated the Sherman Act.

Prosecutors said that Visinescu should be convicted of genocide because the harsh prison conditions he implemented led directly to the deaths of several prisoners. Visinescu faces life imprisonment if found guilty.

<p>Around 500,000 Romanians were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23945391">jailed as political prisoners</a> [BBC report], and nearly 100,000 of them died in prison.

AI Deputy Asia Pacific Director Isabelle Arradon stated that the current draft constitution represents a step backward for human rights because it immunizes government officials for human rights violations and grants the government the power to restrict speech and detain people without trial:<blockquote>Contrary to the claims of Fiji's government over the last few months, the new constitution actually weakens human rights protections in the country...The new constitution not only erodes basic human rights for the people of Fiji, but grants military, police and government officials absolute immunity for past, present and future human rights violations. This will only serve to allow the perpetrators of serious crimes to act with impunity.</blockquote>The draft constitution is scheduled to be sent to <a href="http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Home.aspx">President Ratu Epeli Nailatikau</a> [official website] on September 6.

<p>Fiji has faced political turmoil since the military <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/05/fiji.travel2">seized power in a coup in 2006</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder]. In August 2012 the <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.fj/highcourt.html">High Court of Fiji</a> [official website] found <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1535214.stm">Laisenia Qarase</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Laisenia+Qarase">news archive</a>], the country's last democratically-elected prime minister, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fiji-ex-pm-convicted-of-corruption.php">guilty of nine counts of corruption</a> [JURIST report].

The law, approved by a margin of 102-22, aims to raise the quality of the nation's education. Under the new law, teachers are required to take an evaluation at least every four years. If they fail the evaluation three times, they will be terminated without any liability on part of the educational authority or agency. The new law is part of reforms that Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Enrique Pena Nieto</a> [official website, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21600045">profile</a>] is undertaking to boost the nation's economy. Teachers and students have protested against the approval of the new bill. The <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/inicio.htm">lower house</a> [official website, in Spanish] had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/02/us-mexico-reforms-education-idUSBRE98102Q20130902">approved</a> [Reuters report] the bill on Sunday. 

<p>In February Nieto <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mexico-president-signs-major-education-reform-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] additional education reform into law. While the president himself <a href="http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/educational-reform-everyones-commitment/">wrote</a> [statement] simply that the "major purpose of this reform is to make education a force to transform Mexico," many <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/26/us-mexico-education-idUSBRE91P0WU20130226">suggested</a> [Reuters op-ed] that the legislation intends to curb alleged abuses by the 1.5 million-member <a href="http://www.snte.org.mx/index2.php">National Union of Education Workers</a> (NUEW) [union website, in Spanish], which is the largest labor syndicate in Latin America and is said to control the country's education system. A day after Nieto signed the education reforms, controversial NUEW leader Elba Esther Gordillo was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/world/americas/leader-of-mexican-teachers-union-arrested.html?_r=1&">arrested</a> [NYT report] for allegations that she embezzled approximately $200 million for personal expenses that include California houses, plastic surgery and artwork. Known as "La Maestra," Gordillo is considered a figurehead in the country's political scene and a powerful kingmaker throughout Mexico. In September then-president-elect Nieto <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mexico-president-elect-proposes-reforms-to-increase-access-to-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a proposal for similar constitutional reforms that would increase government transparency. He also announced plans to propose a national anti-corruption commission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statements come after increased violence in the city of Karachi. Sharif presided over security meetings discussing how to <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-improve-anti-terror-laws-nawaz-sharif-1.1227402">improve Pakistan's approach to terrorism</a> [IANS report]. While he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23960762">ruled out</a> [BBC report] official military operations, Sharif noted all other avenues will be explored, including use of paramilitary forces. Legal experts have pointed out there are loopholes that may allow suspected terrorists to be acquitted too easily. In the security meeting, senior officials discussed key administrative flaws that could be addressed to improve the legal regime. In addition, Sharif called for an <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/karachi/04-Sep-2013/pm-orders-leas-intel-agencies-to-abolish-no-go-areas-in-karachi">immediate end to all "no-go" areas</a> [<em>The Nation</em> report].

<p>Late last month the Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) officially <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] for the murder of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>].  In May the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf from running for public office for the rest of his life, as well as extending his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto.

Ban <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE9820VX20130903">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the use of force is lawful only in two very limited circumstances: (1) when used in self-defense according to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> [text] of the UN charter or (2) when the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] approves such action. Ban questioned whether the planned use of force would solve the situation in Syria. He added that such use would cause more damage. Ban noted that UN inspectors are deployed to investigate whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria. According to Ban, the UNSC would be able to overcome its differences and take action once investigations are done. A potential US strike has been opposed by Russia. <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] on Wednesday <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/04/20319870-russias-putin-warns-us-against-aggression-in-syria-without-un-approval?lite">warned</a> [NBC report] the US and its allies to take any unilateral action. However, he stated that he may support the UN action once investigations reveal the use of chemical weapons.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the reported chemical weapon attacks that killed hundreds in the Ghouta region of Damascus as a "serious escalation" in the fight between Syria's government and rebel forces. Also last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Windsor</a> [opinion, PDF], handed down in June, Black could <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-usa-ohio-gayrights-idUSBRE98301Q20130904">not find a legitimate state interest</a> [Reuters report] in the denial of Michener's request for Ives to be listed as "married" on the death certificate. 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Last month Pennsylvania officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pennsylvania-officials-challenge-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to halt the <a href="http://www.montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid=202">Montgomery County Register of Wills</a> [official website] from continuing to issue same-sex marriage licenses in the county. In July the San Diego County Clerk <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/california-clerk-asks-state-high-court-to-halt-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court of California on Friday seeking to require county clerks to enforce Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban. Also in July three same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/arkansas-lawsuit-seeks-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Arkansas' same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs argue that Amendment 83 to the Arkansas Constitution, which reads, "Marriage consists only of the union of one man and one woman," violates their rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The controversial acquittal of George Zimmerman sparked the federal government investigation of the trial to evaluate the evidence and testimony relied on during the proceedings. The experts urge that the investigation should be finalized including an analysis of existing US law to ensure the US is in compliance with its international civil rights obligations. These obligations include those found in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx">International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> [text]. The working group claims this situation exemplifies the need for the US to review its laws that may have a discriminatory effect.

<p>The Zimmerman trial has sparked a wide range of debate in the US, from gun control to racial discrimination. The federal investigation, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/florida-begins-its-investigation-into-self-defense-law.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in June 2012, set out to determine the effect of the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/Chapter0776/All">stand your ground law</a> [text]. There are some who <a href="/hotline/2012/04/tim-lynch-trayvon-martin.php">argue</a> [JURIST comment] that the stand your ground law was not determinative in the case. The <a href="/dateline/2013/08/liz-rinehart-jury-nullification.php">role of jury nullification</a> [JURIST comment] has also been discussed by JURIST guest columnist Liz Clark Rinehart.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation at issue, Local Law 71 of 2013, is a bill that expands the definition of racial profiling and gives New Yorkers who believe they were targeted the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/usa-newyork-police-idUSL2N0GZ1SK20130903">right to sue</a> [Reuters report] police in state court. In the complaint, the mayor's office claims that Local Law 71 is preempted by the state's criminal code. The City Council <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nyc-mayor-sues-over-law-easing-suits-vs-police-hed-vetoed-and-vowed-to-go-to-court-over-it/2013/09/03/387f8baa-14eb-11e3-b220-2c950c7f3263_story.html">passed the bill last month</a> [AP report], overriding Bloomberg's veto. 

<p>Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the stop-and-frisk policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. In July of last year a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the NYPD used excessive force and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. In May of last year, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution. That March NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">fervently denied</a> [press release] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/profile/794">latest report</a> [text] identified more than 200 munition sites in Syria, many of which lie in heavily civilian-populated cities. Although the continuous use in Syria is deeply concerning, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/04/cluster-munitions-syria-use-persists">reported</a> [press release] that global trends reflected positive growth in awareness and counter-munition actions in many states. "Syria is persisting in using cluster bombs, insidious weapons that remain on the ground, causing death and destruction for decades. ... Meanwhile, other countries around the world that have joined the treaty are showing a strong commitment to get rid of cluster bombs once and for all." Although the US has not signed the treaty, it is expected that the targeting of civilians, in conjunction recent evidence of the use of chemical weapons, will be taken into consideration as the US considers entering into conflict with Syria.

<p>This is not the first report calling attention to Syria using cluster munitions. In March HRW reported that the Syrian military was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using cluster munitions against civilians</a>, following up on their <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/evidence-that-syria-forces-use-cluster-munitions-revealed-hrw.php">July</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">October</a> [JURIST reports] 2012 reports of their use of Soviet Union munition productions in military encounters. <a href="http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/3075">Syria's last comment</a> [LCMM report] about the subject was in 2011 Conference on Cluster munitions. There, the representative stated that Syria supported the convention but cited the ongoing conflict with Israel in the Golan Heights as the reason the country could not ban the weapon domestically. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In its call to the UN, FIDH <a href="http://www.fidh.org/iraq-the-authorities-must-investigate-into-1st-september-killings-at-camp-13898">noted</a> [press release] an alleged statement of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-revolutionary-guards/p14324">Islamic Revolution Guards Corps</a> [CFR backgrounder], "which welcomed and endorsed the killing of Camp Ashraf's residents as 'a historical revenge of brave children of martyred Iraqi mujaheds'" Meanwhile, the UN called on Iraqi forces to launch an investigation into the shootings and immediately provide extradition and protection on the surviving refugees.

In the cover letter of the pardon request, Manning's lawyer argued that his client disclosed sensitive information neither to harm the US nor for monetary gain. The lawyer further claimed that most of the released information was unclassified. Manning reasoned that she released the classified information "out of concern for my country and the world that we live in." She stressed that her decision was based on moral grounds and appealed to her duty to others. Along with the cover letter and application for pardon, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] filed a supporting statement in which it addressed the inhumane treatment towards Manning while in confinement and the fact that the leaked documents contained human rights violations committed by US troops abroad. AI also reminded <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] that under "international human rights law, the 'essential aim' of a penitentiary system should be the 'reformation and social rehabilitation' of prisoners, rather than retribution." The pardon request may not be addressed for years, given that the White House <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-usa-wikileaks-manning-idUSBRE9830XS20130904">announced</a> [Reuters report] that the application will be treated as any other.

<p>In August Manning, known previously as Bradley, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">sentenced to 35 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for her disclosure of classified information to the anti-secrecy organization <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [advocacy website]. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 794 et seq.] but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." In April the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces rejected a request by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) to gain access to court documents from Manning's case. That month the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. In February Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to Wikileaks. Also in February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] that argued for Manning's release based on a lack of a speedy trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 10-7 vote, the committee reasoned that Syria was in violation of international law, such as the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> [materials], the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">Geneva Conventions</a> and the <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/aptgenev.pdf">Protocol to the Hague Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare</a> [texts, PDF]. The committee determined that Syria employed chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction against its own citizens thereby causing more than 100,000 death in the last two years. The resolution authorizes <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to use force in a limited and specified manner. The authorization is to last for 60 days with the possibility of an extension determined by the US president. The resolution will be presented to the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> for approval next week before it goes to the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official websites].

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this week UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-questions-legality-of-potential-us-strike-on-syria.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the US plan to strike Syria. Ban stated that the use of force is lawful only in two very limited circumstances: (1) when used in self-defense according to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> [text] of the UN charter; or (2) when the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] approves such action. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the reported chemical weapon attacks that killed hundreds in the Ghouta region of Damascus as a "serious escalation" in the fight between Syria's government and rebel forces. Also last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-syrian-use-of-ballistic-missiles-violates-international-humanitarian-law.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that nine apparent ballistic missile attacks on populated areas have killed at least 215 citizens including 100 children. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace to the country. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/557201394151530910116.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF], <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] informed Congress that the DOJ will not enforce the provision of Title 38 defining a spouse as a person of the opposite sex, because it is identical to Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text, PDF] that was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">struck down by the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] in June. Holder applied the Supreme Court's reasoning, writing:<blockquote>Like Section 3, the Title 38 provisions have the effect of placing lawfully married same-sex couples in a "second-tier marriage," which "departs from [a] history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage," for "no legitimate purpose."</blockquote>Holder said that due to recent developments, including a federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-same-sex-spouses-entitled-to-veterans-benefits.php">finding the Title 38 provision unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], further enforcement of the law would be unwarranted and "would likely have a tangible adverse effect on the families of veterans, and, in some circumstances, active-duty service members and reservists." 

<p>In August the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-military-to-provide-equal-benefits-to-same-sex-families.php">extend benefits to same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report]. Likewise, those couples stationed in a jurisdiction that will not provide a valid marriage certificate to same-sex couples will be <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16203">granted leave</a> [press release] to obtain a license and certificate. All benefits will be retroactive to the date of the ruling for current members who provide a valid certificate. Benefits are set to begin on or before September 3. The DOD has steadily increased benefits to same-sex couples since the revocation of <a href="/feature/featured/dadt/">Don't Ask Don't Tell</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [OHCHR], there are currently more than 215 million migrants around the world, but this enormous group remains largely invisible. Pillay said, "[o]ur starting point is that migration is not merely an anonymous "mega-trend" nor merely an economic and political phenomenon. It is a fundamentally human process, and one which increasingly holds up a mirror to rising global inequalities." The OHCHR also released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Migration/MigrationHR_improvingHR_Report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] exploring possible future governance spaces of migration and human rights and explained that without sufficient opportunities, migrants resort to smuggling and become victims of traffickers. Further, the report stated that many migrants "face violence, abuse, discrimination, xenophobia and exploitation in the work place and in their private, social, cultural and public life."

<p>In May the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Migration/SRMigrants/Pages/SRMigrantsIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants</a> [official website] Francois Crepeau urged the EU to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-eu-to-respect-migrants-rights.php">focus on human rights in its migration policies</a> [JURIST report]. Crepeau visited both sides of the border in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.2_EN.pdf">Turkey</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.4_en.pdf">Greece</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add1_en.pdf">Tunisia</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add3_en.pdf">Italy</a> [official reports] to investigate the experience of migrants. He found that those irregular migrants related to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arab+spring">Arab Spring</a> [JURIST news archive] and global south were unduly targeted for security purposes that were ineffective and indirectly exploitative. Irregular migrants are those seeking economic opportunities that do not enter through a traditional visa program, usually because a sufficient program is not offered by the EU to support the seasonal work force required by its member states' economies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement between the UN and the Cambodian government specifies that the UN is responsible for the salaries of foreign staff, while it is the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/cambodian-government-failure-fund-court-111617425.html">Cambodian government's duty</a> [AP report] to pay employees from Cambodia. The government of Cambodia, however, has failed to pay employees for months, and the tribunal has <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/finances">received its funding</a> [official website] entirely from voluntary contributions. Asia Director of HRW Brad Adams stated:<blockquote>The government has demonstrated it has plenty of cash to pay a bloated army and buy elections, making its refusal to put money into the Khmer Rouge tribunal a symbol of its utter contempt for justice in Cambodia. Donors and the UN should insist that the Cambodian government stop pretending to be too poor to provide accountability to the millions of victims of the Khmer Rouge.</blockquote>Approximately 100 tribunal staff members <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-staff-goes-on-strike.php">went on strike</a> [JURIST report] Sunday to protest unpaid wages, while UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-needs-funding.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] donors to provide financial support to keep the tribunal running. Tribunal employees reported to HRW that they are also bitter due to "government interference and corruption at the court." 

<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khmer+rouge">news archive</a>] have been blamed for the deaths of more than 1.7 million people from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979. The ECCC was established in 2001 to investigate and try those responsible for the Cambodian genocide, which resulted in the deaths of approximately one-third of the Cambodian population. In June 2011 the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial-of-former-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">began the trials of four former Khmer Rouge leaders</a> [JURIST report]. Nuon Chea was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/ex-khmer-rouge-second-in-command.php">arrested and charged</a> in September 2007 and said that he was never in the position to order the deaths attributed to him but that he would <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/khmer-rouge-tribunal-expects.php">cooperate with the tribunal</a> [JURIST reports]. Ieng Thirith and Ieng Sary were also arrested and charged in September 2007, though Sary <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/cambodia-khmer-rouge-foreign-minister-dies-while-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">died while on trial</a>, and Thirith has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-releases-former-khmer-rouge-leader.php">released</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2010, the ECCC handed down its first and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">only conviction</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [TrialWatch profile], better known as "Duch," who was in charge of the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As of August 1, eight HIV-positive female <a href="http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/alabama_prison_system_ending_s.html">inmates were transferred</a> [AL.com report] to the general prison population, with similar changes to the male inmate population to go into effect in 2014. The ADOC will keep identities of HIV-positive prisoners <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/05/alabama-to-stop-segregating-hiv-positive-inmates/?test=latestnews">confidential</a> [AP report] while upholding a zero-tolerance policy for violence directed toward the inmates. 

<p>In December a judge for the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama ruled that Alabama's policy of segregating HIV-positive prisoners <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-orders-alabama-to-desegregate-hiv-positive-prisoners.php">violated the Americans with Disabilities Act</a> [JURIST report]. The ACLU filed the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Class_Action_Complaint_Final.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the ADOC in 2011. The ACLU and Human Rights Watch jointly produced a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Report%20Sentenced%20to%20Stigma%20Segregation%20of%20HIV-Positive%20Prisoners%20in%20Alabama%20and%20South%20Carolina.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], which concluded that the prisoners face fundamental discrimination which amounts to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners," including "involuntary disclosure of HIV status to family, staff and other prisoners; loss of liberty by assignment to higher security prisons; denial of work, program and re-entry opportunities; and policies that promote, rather than combat, fear, prejudice and even violence against persons living with HIV." In 2009 Mississippi ended its HIV segregation policy, and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/south-carolina-prisons-end-hiv-segregation.php">South Carolina</a> [JURIST report] became the last state to do so in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the JPP, many of these detainees are being held indefinitely without charges, trial or access to a lawyer. Many prisoners have testified to being captured and held in the prison without ever being told about the basis for their detainment. The report proffers:<blockquote>With the US withdrawal of combat forces on the horizon, and the handover of Afghan detainees to Afghan authorities now complete, the continued detention of third-country nationals raises the specter of another Guantanamo Bay on Afghan soil.</blockquote>The US government continues to <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/04/20327765-bagram-prison-another-guantanamo-in-the-making?lite">house at least 60 non-Afghan prisoners</a> [NBC News report] at the Bagram facility, including around 40 Pakistanis. 

<p>The rights of Afghan detainees at Bagram has been a controversial issue. Last November Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said that US forces were capturing and holding Afghans in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/afghanistan-president-claims-us-violating-detainee-pact.php">violation of a detainee transfer pact</a> [JURIST report] and that US forces should turn over that responsibility to Karzai's forces. Karzai's statement urged Afghan officials to make efforts toward obtaining entire responsibility for Bagram prison. Listed abuses included Afghan detainees held by US forces despite Afghan rulings to the contrary and the continued arrest of Afghans by US forces. JURIST Guest Columnist Ken Roach recently discussed the issue of prisoners <a href="/forum/2012/11/kent-roach-rahmatullah-detention.php">seeking substitute justice</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the courts of other democracies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The convention became binding international law to a number of countries, prompting many to begin implementing legislative reforms aimed at improving domestic workers' labor and social rights. Approximately 53 million workers will be affected by the convention, which gives employees the right to claim basic rights, including days off each week, set hours and a minimum wage. ILO member states Bolivia, Italy, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Philippines, South Africa and Uruguay have already ratified the convention. Costa Rica and Germany have begun the ratification process, while a number of other countries, including the US, have begun implementing labor laws and regulations.

<p>According to a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-report-shows-domestic-workers-lack-adequate-legal-protections.php">January ILO study</a> [JURIST report], entitled <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_173363.pdf">Domestic Workers Across the World</a> [text, PDF], domestic workers working for private households are vulnerable due to a lack of clear terms of employment, as well as their exclusion from labor legislation. Rights of domestic workers has been a controversial issue for years. Last September the Domestic Workers Convention was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-domestic-worker-rights-treaty-to-take-effect-next-year.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] by enough countries to qualify to go into force in September 2013. In October 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-expert-warns-of-potential-lebanon-slavery.php">warned Lebanon</a> [JURIST report] specifically that it needed to create more laws to protect rights of domestic workers. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hrw-urges-lebanon-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">expressed the same opinion</a> [JURIST report], stating that Lebanon needed to do more to protect domestic workers in its country and prosecute those who violate their rights. HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/domestic-workers-facing-abusive.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 saying that migrant and domestic workers were facing human rights abuses throughout the Middle East and Asia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Dutchbat's conduct could be attributed to the state based on two sets of rules established by the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/law/ilc/">International Law Commission</a> [official website]. Further, the court found that Dutchbat acted wrongfully in turning away the refugees because it had jurisdiction to comply with the human rights enshrined in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. The court addressed the state's concern that this decision would have adverse effects on the implementation of peace operations, writing: <blockquote>This should not, after all, prevent the possibility of judicial assessment in retrospect of the conduct of the relevant troop contingent. The court should indeed make allowance for the fact that this concerns decisions taken under great pressure in a war situation.</blockquote>In two separate <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Hoge-Raad/OverDeHogeRaad/publicaties/Documents/12%2003329.pdf">judgments</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Hoge-Raad/OverDeHogeRaad/publicaties/Documents/12%2003324.pdf">text</a>, PDF] the court upheld a 2011 decision by the The Hague Appeals court. 

<p>Relatives of the victims <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/srebrenica-victims-file-complaint-against-dutch-peacekeepers.php">filed the complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the Dutch prosecutor's office in July 2010 alleging that three Dutch soldiers, operating as UN peacekeepers, were complicit in the commission of war crimes and genocide during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. The complaint argued that the soldiers knew the victims would be killed if they were handed over to Serbian troops. Relatives of the victims of the Srebrenica massacre had previously sought justice for the actions of Dutch peacekeeping forces, which they say led to the massacre. In March The Hague Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">upheld</a> the UN's immunity from prosecution by <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">rejecting claims</a> [JURIST reports] brought by relatives of victims of the massacre. The relatives, known as the Mothers of Srebrenica, alleged that the Netherlands should be liable for the deaths because Dutch soldiers operating under the UN flag negligently failed to protect civilians by forcing the victims out of "safe area" and turning them over to Bosnian Serbs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The files, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?hp&_r=0">published</a> [NYT report] in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> [official websites], reveal a 10-year NSA decryption program, making data through Internet cable taps exploitable. The files were reportedly received from former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden. The report alleges that the NSA hacked into computers to obtain information before it was encrypted and passed that information along to the GCHQ. The NSA justified its decryption program by alleging that it has helped decode communications by leaders of al Qaeda. The <a href="http://www.dni.gov/index.php">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a> [official website] released its own <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/why-we-published-the-decryption-story#odni-response">response</a>, following the report, which states:<blockquote>It should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract our adversaries' use of encryption. Throughout history, nations have used encryption to protect their secrets, and today, terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others also use code to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.</blockquote>ProPublica followed its report by releasing a <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/why-we-published-the-decryption-story">statement</a> [ProPublica report] about its intentions, stating that they believe the report was in the public interest.

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In June the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Snowden, who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">came forward</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in early June as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday's statement comes as a reaction to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/britain-detains-partner-of-reporter-tied-to-leaks.html?_r=0">recent detention</a> [NYT article] of David Miranda, partner of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us"><em>The Guardian</em></a> [official website] journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has broken several stories regarding governmental surveillance activities. Along with Miranda's arrest at the Heathrow Airport in London, British officials reportedly destroyed <em>The Guardian's</em> computer hard drives. Frank La Rue, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression</a>, [official website] put the concerns of press freedom before those of national security secrets, stating that "[t]he press plays a central role in the clarification of human rights abuses." Therefore, says La Rue, "The protection of national security secrets must never be used as an excuse to intimidate the press into silence and backing off from its crucial work in the clarification of human rights violations." The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism</a>, [official website] Ben Emmerson, then urged that a debate take place to officially determine what official access of data should be available to the public. 

<p>Protection of free expression remains a key concern for international human rights advocates. The <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website] in July 2012 called upon President Mohamed Waheed Hassan [official profile] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom-in-maldives.php">ensure press freedom</a> [JURIST report] in the Maldives. Earlier that month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] urged the government of Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">end arrests and office raids of journalists</a> [JURIST report] who publish content critical of the government. In June two reports were presented to the UN Human Rights Council urging <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-protections-for-journalists.php">greater protection for the right to life of journalists</a> [JURIST report] and media freedom. The CPJ in February released its annual <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom.php">Attacks on the Press report </a>[JURIST report], expressing concern about increased censorship of journalists worldwide in 2011. The CPJ criticized the growing trend of government censorship, especially Internet censorship. Last May, journalism rights group <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters without Borders</a> (RSF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/middle-east-leaders-among-annual-list-of-threats-to-press-freedom.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual list of predators of press freedom, which included the heads of state of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

According to the report, in 2012 more than 100,000 people paid smugglers to transport them to Yemen, and over two tons of heroin were trafficked to and through EA. Further, the report states that each year up to 15,400 elephants are poached in EA, producing up to 154 metric tons of illicit ivory, of which two-thirds is sent to Asia. Finally, an estimated 15 percent of Somalia's 2011 GDP was reportedly brought in by Somalian pirates. The UNODC wrote:<blockquote> Most of the population of Eastern Africa is poor, and their governments have limited capacity to deter cross-border criminality. Poverty and weak governance also increase the potential for corruption, rendering Eastern Africa a relatively attractive region to traffic from, though, and to. Until the rule of law is firmly established in the region, these crimes and others like them are likely to continue.</blockquote>While EA's local governments must be strengthened, "purely local interventions are inadequate," because EA's illicit markets often originate or terminate on other continents, according to the UNODC. 

<p>In June the UNODC and the government of Japan came to an <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2013/May/unodc-executive-director-welcomes-signing-of-joint-plan-of-action-with-japan-cooperation-on-africa.html">agreement</a> [UNODC press release] to increase efforts to combat drug and human trafficking in Africa and Southeast Asia. The agreement was reached at the end of the Fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD V) in Yokohama, Japan. The new Plan of Action attempts to combat these problems through an integrated approach that attacks the causes of this type of illegal activity&#8212;poverty. Specifically, in the Sahel region of Africa, the group will attempt to address these growing problems by increasing crop production and manufacturing systems so that legitimate economies may thrive. Japan announced that it will also be contributing $1 billion to the $32 billion fund to increase efforts over the next five years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The injunction, rendered by Judge Denise Cote, forbids Apple from making any contractual relations with publishing companies that "restricts, limits, or impedes Apple's ability to set, alter, or reduce the Retail Price of any E-book." In addition, the decision requires the court to appoint an "external compliance monitor" who will have the power and authority to review and evaluate Apple's existing anti-trust compliance procedures and policies during a two year period. The terms of the injunction are binding for five years, with the court maintaining the option to renew the injunction in one-year increments. Apple stated they would <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/09/06/apple-ebooks-idINDEE98508T20130906">appeal the decision</a> [Reuters report].

<p>This injunction follows a July decision by Cote, who <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-finds-apple-guilty-of-e-book-price-fixing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Apple violated the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a> [text] and various state statutes in an e-book price-fixing conspiracy. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] accused Apple of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books. Five publishers, Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon &#38; Schuster Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and Macmillan, were originally <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f282100/282135.pdf">named in the complaint</a> [text, PDF] but since reached a settlement with the government. In May Cote gave a tentative <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-believes-doj-will-prevail-in-apple-antitrust-case.php">opinion</a> [JURST report] that the government would be successful in its antitrust claim. The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April 2012, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 28-nation group has frozen assets and banned travel since 2010 for Iranian citizens thought to be linked to the nation's nuclear development. Citing insufficient evidence, the EU court nullified the sanctions on select companies and banks because the governments of the 28 nations did not "properly establish that they had provided support for nuclear proliferation." The court has stated that the sanctions will remain in place for two months to allow for an appeal. If any EU government files an appeal, the sanctions will remain in place until the final ruling. The EU's foreign policy chief, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/index_en.htm">Catherine Ashton</a> [official website], also announced Friday that she plans to meet with Tehran's negotiator in hope of building friendlier relations and relieving the tension in Iran's continued quest for atomic weapons.

<p>Iran has been no stranger to sanctions in recent years. Leaders of the country have repeatedly claimed that its nuclear program was developed for peaceful purposes, but several members of the international community contend that Iran's enrichment program was designed for military purposes. In February 2012 the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/obama-signs-order-imposing-stricter-sanctions-on-iran.php">US imposed sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Iran due to the misleading practices of Iranian banks. Many, however, viewed this action as an attempt to convince Iran to disassemble its nuclear program by placing a strain on its already struggling economy. In 2010, The UN Security Council voted to impose a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran.php">fourth round of sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Iran for failure to disband the nation's uranium enrichment program. In December 2006, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-security-council-imposes-nuclear.php">imposed sanctions</a> on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium and <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/security-council-broadens-iran-nuclear.php">broadened them</a> [JURIST reports] three months later. The UN had previously ordered Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/breaking-news-un-security-council.php">stop expanding</a> [JURIST report] its nuclear program by August 31, 2006. Iran stated it would <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-threatens-iaea-withdrawal-if.php">completely withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the International Atomic Energy Agency if its "nuclear rights" were taken away. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision, issued last week, comes in response to a June 2012 request for arbitration by the City of New Orleans following a May 2012 decision by FEMA regarding:<blockquote>The money reimbursement of one third of the city's regular time salary costs for its police, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) first responders who performed emergency disaster response work during the first four months after Hurricane Katrina struck the city.</blockquote>FEMA contended in a February 2012 e-mail to the City of New Orleans, and in a May 2012 decision letter, that according to pre-existing agency policy and procedure it was unable to provide funding. The Board rejected FEMA's argument, concluding that FEMA policy does not prohibit FEMA from providing reimbursement of regular pay incurred following a disaster. 

<p>Numerous legal issues have sprung up in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/default.aspx">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/fifth-circuit-finds-army-corps-of-engineers-not-liable-for-katrina-damage.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE) [official website] was not liable for damages caused by canal breaches that occurred during Hurricane Katrina.The ruling overturned a March decision by the same Fifth Circuit panel, which held that the USACE <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/fifth-circuit-rulesl-army-corps-of-engineers-liable-for-katrina-damage.php">was liable for the damages</a> [JURIST report]. The appeal followed a 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-finds-army-corps-of.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] which held that the USACE made "negligent decisions" that "rested on applications of objective scientific principles and were not susceptible to policy consideration," and awarded plaintiffs approximately $720,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UNHCR reported that during a visit to CAR last week, they witnessed virtual lawlessness in the CAR, discovering several villages burned to the ground and deserted. The UNHCR reported that local inhabitants described physical assaults, extortion, looting, arbitrary arrests and torture. The CAR has experienced significant violence since the <a href="http://worldwideconflicts.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/profile-seleka-coalition">Seleka rebel coalition</a> [WorldWideConflict profile] ousted president Francous Bozize in March.

Although statistics on the number of refugees is unavailable, before the rebels seized power in March, almost 160,000 people lived in the affected area.

<p>In August, chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official websites], <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/icc-prosecutor-voices-concern-over-situation-in-central-african-republic.php">expressed her concern</a> over the deteriorating security situation in CAR. Earlier that month, a panel of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-situation-in-central-african-republic.php">expressed their concern</a> [JURIST report] over the situation in the CAR. Earlier this month the UN Assistant Secetary-General for Human Rights held a press conference where he <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-warns-international-community-on-central-african-republic.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to remember the fragile state of the CAR. In June the CAR <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/central-african-republic-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ousted-leader-bozize.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for ousted president Bozize. In May Human Rights Watch (HRW) [official website] reported that members of the Seleka rebel coalition have <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-centrial-african-republic-rebels-have-committed-rights-violations.php">committed rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi is <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2013-09/07/c_132700604.htm">charged with insulting the judiciary</a> [Xinhua report] after he accused 22 judges of fraud during the 2005 parliamentary elections in a televised interview. Morsi is currently in detention, and this most recent sentence will be added to his current jail term. He recently had his <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-court-extends-morsi-detention.php">15 day sentence extended</a> [JURIST report] to allow authorities to investigate claims that he conspired with Palestinian militants in 2011 during Egypt's uprising. Morsi has also been accused of interfering with his prosecution and attempting to influence the judiciary over the trial of the rival presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq. 

<p>Although Egypt has faced unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] Mohamed Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. Last month the Egyptian prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/egypt-pm-proposes-legal-dissolution-of-muslim-brotherhood.php">proposed formally dissolving</a> [JURIST report] the non-governmental organization registration of the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to force the group underground. In July The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-office-urges-egypt-to-address-escalating-violence-after-morsis-removal.php">urged Egyptian authorities</a> [JURIST report] to address the escalating violence that followed Morsi's ousting. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Adly Mansour, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state on the same day that Morsi was deposed. According to the OHCHR more than 80 people have been killed and over 1000 injured since political turmoil gripped the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DRC has seen an increase in violence in the last year as a result of continuing sectarian conflict in the region. Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region Mary Robinson insisted that those responsible for rights violations must be held accountable. She said that the international community must take a multifaceted approach in order to resolve the conflict, employing both political and military means to achieve their goal. Robinson's comments followed a four-day tour through Goma, where she was joined by several other  UN representatives. Violence in the DRC has displaced over 100,000 people over the past year, adding to the 2.6 million already displaced in the nation. Robinson continued to emphasize the need for a more holistic approach to ending the violence.

<p>Human rights and humanitarian concerns continue to be a concern surrounding the violence in the DRC. Last month, UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-calls-for-drc-to-respect-human-rights.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] the importance of respecting human rights in the DRC. In July <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the rebel group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">news archive</a>] is <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/hrw-drc-rebels-recieving-aid-from-rwanda-despite-abuses.php">receiving assistance from Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] despite continued human rights abuses by the M23, including rape, executions and forced recruitment of young boys. In May a UN report found that DRC troops <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">committed rape and murder</a> [JURIST report] as they retreated from an advance by M23 rebels last November. In February HRW reported that during the siege of Goma, M23 forces <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">summarily executed 24 individuals</a> [JURIST report], 21 of whom were civilians, and raped 36 women, including a 10-year-old girl.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, Nicholas Kay, urged the international community to continue to support the Somali people as they work toward peace, noting that this kind of terrorism poses a threat not only to Somalia and Africa in general, but also to the world as a whole. Kay, who heads the <a href="http://unsom.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Somalia</a> (UNSOM) [official website], said that UNSOM was poised to assist the people of Somalia in combating terrorism.

<p>Ways to address violence and human rights abuses in Somalia continues to be a concern.

HRW noted that the threat of beatings and rape from internal security forces was significant and called for the practices to end.

Last year disabled veterans joined together to challenge the constitutionality of the 2005 <a href="https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/department/facts-fait/new-veterans-charter">New Veterans Charter</a> (NVC) [government backgrounder], which gave disabled soldiers capped one-time payments in lieu of lifetime monthly payments. The veterans assert that the NVC's lump-sum payment system fails to adequately provide for disabled veterans returning from the war in Afghanistan. The <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/ag/agbio.asp">Attorney General of Canada</a> [official website] filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to make out a winnable claim. Justice Gordon Weatherill, however, denied the motion, emphasizing that the case <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/09/07/afghanistan-veteran-class-action-lawsuit.html">raises important issues</a> [Canadian Press report] regarding the government's promises to compensate injured service members. The court ordered the government to file a response to the plaintiffs' complaint. 

<p>Veterans' rights remain a controversial issue around the globe, especially in the US. Earlier this month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/doj-will-not-enforce-law-denying-veterans-benefits-to-same-sex-spouses.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will no longer enforce a federal law that denies same-sex spouses veterans benefits in light of the US Supreme Court's decision to invalidate Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act.  In August a judge for the US District Court for the Central District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-same-sex-spouses-entitled-to-veterans-benefits.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that Title 38's exclusion of same-sex spouses from veteran's benefits is unconstitutional. Tracey Cooper-Harris, a 12-year Army veteran, sued the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) after it denied her fully disability benefits because she is married to a woman. In January the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/veterans-discharged-under-dadt-to-receive-full-separation-pay.php">announced a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the federal government providing full separation payment to service members discharged under the controversial Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT) policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi on charges that his media empire <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian] purchased television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declared the costs on its taxes. The prosecutors asked for a sentence of three years eight months, but the four-year prison term was reduced to one year because of an amnesty law passed in 2006. A Milan appeals court in May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/italy-appeals-court-upholds-berlusconi-tax-fraud-conviction.php">upheld the tax fraud conviction</a> [JURIST report], affirming his four-year sentence and ban on taking political office. In August Italy's <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Supreme Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/italy-supreme-court-upholds-jail-sentence-for-berlusconi.php">upheld the conviction</a> [JURIST report], marking his first definitive court conviction. The court, however, declined to rule on the lower appeals court five-year ban on political office, sending the matter back to the lower court for reconsideration. A Senate panel will reportedly meet Monday to determine whether Berlusconi must <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57601875/silvio-berlusconi-takes-his-case-to-human-rights-court/">relinquish his Senate seat</a> [AP report] in light of the ruling. Berlusconi's top-aide, however, argued that the ban and prison sentence should not take effect because he has yet to exhaust his rights of appeal in the ECHR.

<p>Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases but has never served a single prison sentence due to either successfully appealing or having the statute of limitations on the charge expire. In addition to the tax fraud charges, he is also facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports] and abusing his power by having the police release her. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a immunity law backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although Pillay criticized global leaders for not acting sooner to stop the violent conflict in Syria, she warned that a military response would not be effective. Pillay observed that any course of action in Syria by the international community would be challenging, but that negotiation would be the best method for ending the conflict:<blockquote>This appalling situation cries out for international action, yet a military response or the continued supply of arms risk igniting a regional conflagration, possibly resulting in many more deaths and even more widespread misery. There are no easy exits, no obvious pathway out of this nightmare, except the immediate negotiation of concrete steps to end the conflict. States, together with the United Nations, must find a way to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table and halt the bloodshed.</blockquote>In her speech, Pillay also drew attention to human rights concerns in nations such as Iraq, Egypt, Bahrain and Turkey.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this week JURIST guest columnist Curtis Doebbler <a href="/forum/2013/09/curtis-doebbler-force-syria.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law. Last week the <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-senate-committee-approves-strike-on-syria.php">approved a joint resolution</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the limited use of force against Syria. Also last week UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-questions-legality-of-potential-us-strike-on-syria.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the US plan to strike Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cayley joined the staff of the UN-backed ECCC in 2009. Cayley has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/top-prosecutor-resigns-khmer-rouge-tribunal-20196780">worked with a Cambodian prosecutor</a> [AP report], and a tribunal spokesperson said that Cayley's departure should not disrupt the workings of the tribunal. Cayley's replacement, Reserve International Co-Prosecutor Nicholas Koumjian, will arrive in October. The ECCC is currently on a break during the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-opens-trial-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">trials</a> [JURIST report] of two Khmer Rouge leaders which began in 2011, former head of state <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC profile] and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Nuon Chea</a> [ECCC profile] for crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and other charges. 

<p>The Khmer Rouge has been blamed for the deaths of more than 1.7 million people from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979.

Approximately 100 tribunal staff members <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-staff-goes-on-strike.php">went on strike</a> [JURIST report] earlier that week to protest the unpaid wages, while UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-needs-funding.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] donors to provide financial support to keep the tribunal running. Tribunal employees reported to HRW that they are also bitter due to "<a href="/hotline/2011/12/nisha-valabhji-cambodian-interference.php">government interference and corruption at the court</a>," [JURIST commentary] which has been a cause of concern since the trials began. The ECCC was established in 2001 to investigate and try those responsible for the Cambodian genocide, which resulted in the deaths of approximately one-third of the Cambodian population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/09/eu-google-idUSL5N0H51GQ20130909">faces</a> [Reuters report] USD $5 billion in fines over accusations that the company's search engine is blocking competitors content and promoting Google services. Google formally <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/39740/39740_8608_5.pdf">offered concessions</a> [text, PDF] to the European Commission for a possible settlement in April, but they were rejected by EU Competition Commissioner <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/almunia/">Joaquin Almunia</a> [official profile] in July. In response to the proposal, <a href="http://www.fairsearch.org/about-fairsearch/">FairSearch.org</a> [advocacy group], a lobbying group comprised of numerous international companies including <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a> [corporate websites], has asked for the Commission to consult industry participants before reaching a final settlement.

<p>Google has faced numerous other allegations regarding its business practices over the past several years. In January the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] held that Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ftc-finds-google-did-not-violate-antitrust-or-anticompetition-laws.php">did not violate</a> [JURIST report] antitrust or anticompetition laws. The claims in the case were similar to those currently pending in the EU&#8212;Google's practice of favoring its own services in search results, to the detriment of its competitors. In December an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a conviction against Google executives for privacy violations. In November a US federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $22.5 million fine against Google for privacy misrepresentations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge was <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/08/guyana-judge-rules-that-cross-dressing-is-not-crime-unless-it-done-for-improper/">interpreting a law</a> [AP report] from 1893, while Guyana was still a colony, but which survived further legislative reforms. Because of the law's persistence despite legislative changes, the judge argued that any change to the law must come from the legislature. The ruling drew criticism from gay rights activists in Guyana who want the law abolished. The <a href="http://www.sasod.org.gy/">Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination</a> [advocacy website] has stated that it <a href="http://sasod.blogspot.com/">plans to appeal the decision</a> [official statement], since the decision still permits police to arrest cross-dressers and transgender citizens for ambiguous reasons. The litigants in the case were arrested while wearing female attire as they waited for taxis. 

<p>Rights for transgender individuals remain a contentious issue throughout the world. Although international human rights laws should provide protections for LGBT individuals, those laws have been criticized for <a href="/hotline/2012/05/charles-radcliffe-un-lgbt.php">poor enforcement</a> [JURIST comment]. In August California Governor <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/california-governor-signs-law-on-transgender-public-school-students.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] into law that amended the state's education code to specifically prohibit public schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity and gender expression and allow students to participate in sex-segregated activities consistent with their own gender identity. In July the US <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-agency-decision-extends-title-vii-protection-to-transgender-workers.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a transgender woman who endured physical and verbal harassment during her employment as a federal contractor in Maryland. A number of human rights groups in May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/cameroon-authorities-urged-to-drop-charges-against-transgendered-youths.php">urged Cameroon to drop charges</a> [JURIST report] against two transgender youths who were arrested for engaging in homosexual conduct. Earlier that month, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hong-kong-high-court-rules-transgender-woman-can-marry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting a transgender woman from marrying her boyfriend was invalid under the Chinese constitution. Last March Canadian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/canada-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-transgender-discrimination.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would outlaw discrimination against transgender individuals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In his <a href="http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/2013/amsp2013n17.html">statement</a> [text], the Director-General of the agency expressed concern about the safeguards currently in place in both countries, suggesting that the governments are not meeting their obligations. In response to recent claims of governments performing nuclear tests, he declared that, "Such actions are clear violations of relevant UN Security Council resolutions." Neither country has complied with UN standards for safeguards, or with the necessary verification activities, which must be conducted for the UN to have knowledge of the status of the countries' nuclear programs. He expressed a commitment to working with the governments towards achieving acceptable safeguards.   

<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/atomicenergy/">UN has addressed this issue</a> [UN backgrounder] with both countries before. The use of atomic energy in these countries, as well as the International response to it has sparked much <a href="/forum/2012/05/daniel-joyner-iran-sanctions.php">debate</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last week the EU General Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-court-annulls-sanctions-on-iran.php">annulled sanctions</a> [JURIST report] imposed upon eight Iranian banks and companies, finding them unjustified. The 28-nation group has frozen assets and banned travel since 2010 for Iranian citizens thought to be linked to the nation's nuclear development. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ruto is on trial for three counts of crimes against humanity that led to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and displacement of more than 600,000. Kenyan <a href="http://www.uhuru.co.ke/">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [official website], is also charged with crimes against humanity, but his trial is not set to begin until November 12. The ICC in June <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr920.aspx">conditionally granted</a> [press release] Ruto's request to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-grants-kenya-vps-request-to-skip-parts-of-upcoming-trial.php"> [JURIST report] be excused from</a> [JURIST report] parts of his trial. The Trial Chamber, however, will still require Ruto to be present for certain parts of his trial, such as for opening and closing statements and for presentations by victims. The Chamber also stated that this conditional grant is for the purpose of allowing Ruto to continue fulfilling the demanding requirements of his position as vice president. Any violation of the conditions may result in the Chamber's withdrawal of the grant. 

<p>In protest of these trials, Kenya's National Assembly voted last week to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw from the ICC</a> [JURIST report], and is expected to take action to this end in the upcoming month. Kenya's parliament began to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-debates-withdrawal-from-icc.php">formally debate</a> [JURIST report] withdrawal earlier last week. In July the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to change the forum of the trials to Kenya or Tanzania. The defense request was filed in January under articles 3(3) and 62 of the Rome Statute and Rule 100 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/legal%20texts%20and%20tools/official%20journal/Documents/RulesProcedureEvidenceEng.pdf#page=47">ICC Rules and Procedures of Evidence</a> [text, PDF], which provide for <em>in situ</em> hearings. African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Kenyatta and Ruto be tried in Kenya after the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Kenyan Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] connecting Kenyatta and Ruto to the post-election violence. Earlier in May Kenya's ambassador to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed. Even with charges for crimes against humanity pending against him, Kenyatta was able to win a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency in March. Kenyatta was sworn in as the country's fourth president <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">following a ruling</a> [JURIST report] from Kenya's Supreme Court that the election results were in fact valid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The revelations come from <a href="http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/DNI%20Clapper%20Section%20702%20Declassification%20Cover%20Letter.pdf">materials</a> [text, PDF] recently declassified by the Obama administration, including a 2011 opinion by the chief judge of the FISC regarding <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/section-702-and-section-215-nsa-fact-sheets">section 702</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/STATUTE-92/STATUTE-92-Pg1783/content-detail.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA). The decision allowed for the NSA to retain US communications the agency intercepted for an additional year and perform searches of e-mail and phone call databases using e-mail addresses and phone numbers of US citizens. According to the report, the 2011 decision overturned a 2008 ban on government requests for searches of such databases.  

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">The Guardian</a> [official website] obtained files <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/jurist-the-guardian-official-website-1.php">showing</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA and its UK counterpart, the <a href="http://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx">Government Communications Headquarters</a> (GCHQ) [official website], compromised the guarantees that Internet companies have given consumers to reassure them that their communications are encrypted. The files, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?hp&_r=1&">published</a> [NYT report] in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> [official websites], reveal a 10-year NSA decryption program, making data through Internet cable taps exploitable. In June the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Katzav, who has consistently denied the charges, has served a quarter of his seven-year sentence, thereby qualifying him for the brief release under Israel's prison rehabilitation policies. Katzav applied for the furlough in July. Monday's outing was the former president's first time out of prison since he was permitted to attend his son's wedding in May 2012.

<p>Katzav's initial <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-indicted-on-rape.php">indictment</a> came down in March 2009 in response to the original <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/israel-president-may-face-rape-sex.php">allegations</a> [JURIST reports] levied in 2006. Katsav was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-israel-president-convicted-of-rape.php">convicted</a> in December 2010 after he rejected a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">plea bargain</a> [JURIST reports]. His sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-prison-sentence-delayed-pending-appeal.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011 pending the outcome of the appeal. His <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/israel-ex-president-begins-appeal-before-high-court.php">appeal began</a> in August 2011 after he submitted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-appeals-rape-conviction-to-high-court.php">300-page document</a> [JURIST reports] following his conviction and sentencing. The <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court of Israel </a>[official website, in Hebrew] in November 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/israel-supreme-court-upholds-ex-presidents-rape-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Katzav's rape convictions. Katsav's lawyer took issue with the court's decision, calling into question the credibility of the victim's testimony. Meanwhile, the confirmation of the conviction was seen widely in Israel as a victory for women's rights and an enticement for rape victims to come forward. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Samsung has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/21/us-eu-samsung-idUSBRE8BK0UJ20121221">charged</a> [Reuters report] with breaching the EU's antitrust rules by engaging in patent lawsuits against the company's chief rival, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website]. Sumsung has since engaged in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/us-eu-samsung-idUSBRE95O0ES20130625">negotiations</a> [Reuters report] for a settlement with the Commission. Upon rejection of Samsung's initial settlement proposal, the European Commission warns that if the company does not offer improved concessions, it may be subjected to a fine of up to USD $18.3 billion. 

<p>The European Commission first opened an <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/eu-competition-regulator-opens-investigation-into-samsung-apple.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether Apple and Samsung breached EU antitrust laws in November 2011. The Commission enforces <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/legislation/articles.html">Articles 101-109</a> [materials] of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:FULL:EN:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the EU</a> (TFEU) [text, PDF; <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:SOM:EN:HTML">materials</a>]. Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits "directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions" and "limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers."

Last week <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> [corporate website] joined Google and Microsoft in publishing a <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/transparency-report/">transparency report</a> [report], which details all government data requests from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2013. However, US law prohibits organizations from disclosing the number of requests under specific national security statutes. General Counsel Ron Bell said:<blockquote>We believe that the US Government's important responsibility to protect public safety can be carried out without precluding Internet companies from sharing the number of national security requests they may receive. Ultimately, withholding such information breeds mistrust and suspicion&#8212;both of the United States and of companies that must comply with government legal directives.</blockquote>The government <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/declassified-materials-show-nsa-surveilence-restrictions-reversed-in-2011.php">recently released</a> [JURIST report] annual aggregate data about its requests for phone logs and Internet chats. However, Bell said that "The United States should lead the world when it comes to transparency, accountability, and respect of civil liberties and human rights. ... Granting our petition for greater transparency around national security requests for user data is a critical second step." 

<p>Revelations surrounding US government surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In July the FISC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/yahoo-allowed-to-disclose-nsa-data-requests-fisc.php">granted a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Yahoo to declassify a 2008 FISC judgment that required the company to comply with government requests for user information under the FISA, as well as any actual Yahoo metadata collected by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] pursuant to the 2008 FISC order. Earlier in July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in the FISC supporting efforts by Google and Microsoft to publish data concerning how many times the government invoked federal law to request user information for national security purposes. Also in July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging the NSA illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" in the wake of 9/11. In July the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order. Also in June Several US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring and a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. The US government has <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former government contractor Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state law bans unions from receiving compensation from non-union employees to pay for bargaining costs and services. Federal law, however, requires unions to bargain on behalf of employees, including non-union members. The <a href="https://portal.iuoelocal150.org/News%20Room/Local%20150%20News/Pages/default.aspx">International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150</a> (IUOE) [union website] filed suit in February, arguing that the state law requires unions to bargain on behalf of employees who do not pay dues. The union argued this requirement violated Article I, Section 21 of the Indiana Constitution, which provides that "[n]o person's particular services shall be demanded, without just compensation." Judge John Sedia <a href="http://posttrib.suntimes.com/22467428-537/lake-county-judge-declares-indianas-right-to-work-law-unconstitutional.html">agreed</a> [<em>Post Tribune</em> report] and invalidated the law Monday. <a href="http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/2354.htm">Attorney General Greg Zoeller</a> [official website] announced plans to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/">Indiana Supreme Court</a> [official wesbite]. In February 2012 the IUOE <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/indiana-union-members-sue-to-block-right-to-work-legislation.php">filed a similar suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.innd.uscourts.gov">United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana</a> [official website] seeking to block the law's implementation. The federal court, however, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-indiana-right-to-work-law.php">dismissed the challenge</a> [JURIST report] in January.

<p>Collective bargaining continues to be a contention issue in the US. In December Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-lawmakers-approve-freedom-to-work-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] known as "Freedom to Work" that makes payment of union dues voluntary and limits workers' ability to strike. In September 2012 the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure was defeated 57-43 percent. Wisconsin faced a challenge against its legislation which limited the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. In July 2012 the Wisconsin Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] not to reopen a case challenging the state's Budget Repair Bill [text, PDF] because of a justice's refusal to recuse himself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the judges reportedly <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_24054953/appeals-court-voices-concerns-fcc-net-neutrality-rules?source=rss">expressed skepticism</a> [Dow Jones report] with respect to the legality of anti-discrimination provisions that prohibit Internet providers from charging "content companies" like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> [corporate website] and Netflix for faster access to consumers. If the rules are invalidated, content companies would be forced to bear more of the financial burden associated with user traffic.

<p>Internet providers have challenged the FCC's net neutrality rules in the past. In April 2011 the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-fcc-net-neutrality-rules.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the FCC to dismiss a challenge to the new net neutrality rules. In January 2011 MetroPCS, the fifth-largest cell phone company in the US, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging net neutrality rules. Also in January 2011 Verizon <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging the net neutrality rules.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yousef Mohammed Saleh Lebis is a member of Sudan's Popular Congress Party (PCP), which is led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3190770.stm">Hassan al-Turabi</a> [BBC profile]. Lebis' release is a result of the promise made by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16010445">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile] in April that he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/sudan-to-release-all-political-detainees.php">release all political detainees</a> [JURIST report] and renew a commitment to maintain an open dialogue. Kamal Omar, political bureau head of the PCP, stated that the government's release of Lebis is positive, but that it does <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/10/sudan-frees-opposition-figure-over-2004-coup-plot/">not change the position</a> [AFP report] of his party, which still seeks a peaceful end to the current Sudanese government. 

<p>Tension has remained extremely high following <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">South Sudan's separation</a> [JURIST report] from Sudan in July 2011, as well as from Sudan's continued history of human rights abuses. In February the UN urged Sudan security forces to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-sudan-security-forces-to-strengthen-human-rights-efforts.php">strengthen human rights efforts</a> [JURIST report] and expressed concern regarding the arrest and detention of political opposition figures. In January <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end its crackdown against political and cultural groups. Al-Bashir has also remained a controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In June 2011 then-ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur.

Ruto is on trial for three counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly fomenting violence following the 2007 elections that led to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and displacement of more than 600,000. Ruto's lawyer <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-kenya-icc-ruto-idUSBRE9890HG20130910">accused prosecutors</a> [Reuters report] of conducting a flawed investigation and also of using tainted evidence. In June the ICC conditionally <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-grants-kenya-vps-request-to-skip-parts-of-upcoming-trial.php">granted Ruto's request</a> [JURIST report] to be excused from parts of his trial. The Trial Chamber will still require Ruto to be present for certain parts of the trial, such as for opening and closing statements and for presentations by victims. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, in her opening speech, described "a carefully planned and executed plan of violence" by Ruto. Ruto is the first senior serving politician to appear in an international court. Kenyan <a href="http://www.uhuru.co.ke/">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [official website] is also charged with crimes against humanity, but his trial is not set to begin until November 12.  

<p>In protest of these trials, Kenya's National Assembly voted last week to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw from the ICC</a> [JURIST report], and is expected to do so in the upcoming month. Kenya's parliament began to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-debates-withdrawal-from-icc.php">formally debate</a> [JURIST report] withdrawal earlier last week. In July the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to change the forum of the trials to Kenya or Tanzania. Earlier in May <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">Kenya's ambassador to the UN requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed. Even with charges for crimes against humanity pending against him, Kenyatta was able to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">win a controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency in March. Kenyatta was sworn in as the country's fourth president following a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from Kenya's Supreme Court that the election results were valid. The ruling came despite argument among the international community that the March election was, in fact, <a href="/hotline/2013/03/george-kegoro-kenya-election.php">marred by technological failures</a> [JURIST op-ed] and the shortcomings of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commissions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW stated that the attack probably involved the use of sarin nerve gas, echoing a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-report-war-crimes-escalating-in-syria.php">UN report</a> [JURIST report] of the suspected use of sarin in Syria dating back to June. HRW also stated that it was probably the government, not rebel forces, which implemented the attack. HRW asserted:<blockquote>The Syrian government has denied its responsibility for the attack, and has blamed opposition groups, but has presented no evidence to back up its claims. Based on the available evidence, Human Rights Watch finds that Syrian government forces were almost certainly responsible for the August 21 attacks, and that a weapons-grade nerve agent was delivered during the attack using specially designed rocket delivery systems.</blockquote>HRW said that it was difficult to establish a death toll from the attacks but reported that at least 3,600 persons were treated for symptoms consistent with neurotoxin exposure and at least 814 had died in the two regions attacked.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. On Monday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-calls-for-negotiations-to-end-syria-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help facilitate negotiations between warring parties in Syria. Earlier this week JURIST guest columnist Curtis Doebbler <a href="/forum/2013/09/curtis-doebbler-force-syria.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law. Last week the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-senate-committee-approves-strike-on-syria.php">joint resolution</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the limited use of force against Syria. Also last week UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-questions-legality-of-potential-us-strike-on-syria.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the US plan to strike Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Baby Girl</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] case that reached the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Anaya urged that "[t]he individual and collective rights of all indigenous children, their families and indigenous peoples must be protected throughout the United States." Following the Supreme Court's decision, a South Carolina state court awarded custody of Veronica to the adoptive couple but failed to determine if that was in Veronica's best interest in light of Veronica spending nearly two years with her father and indigenous family. South Carolina authorities have attempted to force Veronica's father to release custody of Veronica, but, on September 3, the Oklahoma Supreme Court granted a temporary stay of the order pending further proceedings. Anaya stated that Veronica's rights are guaranteed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] and the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF].

<p>In June the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-399_8mj8.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-for-adoptive-couple-in-american-indian-adoption-case.php">Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl</a> [JURIST report] that &#167;1912(f) and &#167;1912(d) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-21">Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978</a> (ICWA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] do not bar the termination of the biological father's parental rights. In the case, a woman put her baby, who was fathered by an American Indian, up for adoption. A South Carolina couple attempted to adopt the child, but once the biological father was notified about the adoption proceedings, he attempted to gain custody. The South Carolina Supreme Court initially ruled for the biological father, stating that the federal ICWA, which seeks to keep American Indian children in their ethnic communities, preempts South Carolina law, but the Supreme Court reversed that decision. JURIST Guest Columnist Megan Lindsey, counsel for the National Council for Adoption, argues that the Supreme Court <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/megan-lindsey-what-now.php">reached the right decision</a> [JURIST op-ed] in its ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case arose after Google acknowledged that its Street View vehicles had been collecting and storing data over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, including personal e-mails, usernames, passwords, videos and documents.  Writing for the court, Judge Jay Bybee ruled that Google's data collection through Wi-Fi does not fall within an exception to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511">Federal Wiretap Act</a> [text] that makes it lawful to "intercept electronic communications that are readily accessible to the general public."<blockquote>In common parlance, watching a television show does not entail "radio communication." Nor does sending an email or viewing a bank statement while connected to a Wi-Fi network. There is no indication that the Wiretap Act carries a buried implication that the phrase ought to be given a broader definition than the one that is commonly understood.</blockquote>The decision affirms a June 2011 district court ruling. 

<p>Google has faced criticism for numerous privacy issues recently. In June a US district court ruled that Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-rules-google-must-comply-with-national-security-letters.php">must follow</a> [JURIST report] the FBI's warrantless requests for user information through <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS22406.pdf">national security letters</a> (NSLs) [CRS backgrounder, PDF]. In April Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">agreed to a $7 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] of another case alleging improper data during its Street View campaign. Also in April six European countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">commenced legal action</a> [JURIST report] against Google regarding its privacy policies. Last December an Italian appeals court overturned the conviction of three Google executives for <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">violating Italian privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by posting a video on Google of a handicapped child being bullied. In June 2012 a Switzerland court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/switzerland-court-partially-rules-for-google-in-privacy-case.php">found for Google</a> [JURIST report] in a privacy suit involving its Street View service. Similarly, in March 2011 a Berlin court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Google, holding that the controversial Street View service is legal in Germany.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/rights-groups-challenge-nypd-over-muslim-surveillance.php">lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] in June by plaintiffs represented by the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and CUNY School of Law's <a href="http://www.cunyclear.org/">Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &#38; Responsibility</a> (Clear) [advocacy websites] project of Main Street Legal Services, Inc., who argue that the NYPD has been unlawfully sending spies into mosques and student associations in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Although indicating that the NYPD conducted investigations of Preacher Mohammad Elshinawy and college student Asad Dandia, as well as of individuals associated with the the Al-Ansar Mosque and the Masjid At-Taqwa mosque, the city's response denied "any implication that the NYPD conducts unlawful surveillance of any institution or individual."

<p>Last week Bloomberg <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/new-york-city-mayor-files-suit-over-new-stop-and-frisk-legislation.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the New York City Council in an effort to overturn recently-enacted legislation relating to the NYPD <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/criminal-procedure/CPL0140.50_140.50.html">stop-and-frisk program</a> [text].

Drainville explained that the ban would apply to public workers such as teachers and police officers, but not to elected officials, saying that people have the right to choose their own representatives. The Canadian government <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24041497">announced</a> [Reuters report] that it will consult its <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to determine whether the values charter violates fundamental religious freedoms.

These <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/section-215-patriot-act-foia">documents</a> [materials] were declassified as a result of a lawsuit brought by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] under the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/free-speech-national-security-technology-and-liberty/reform-patriot-act-section-215">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [ACLU backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [official website] set the standard for legality of such queries at "reasonable articulable suspicion." However, declassified document show the NSA performed searches on new calling data based on a much lower standard. This resulted in an increase in the amount of numbers included on an "alert list" from about 3,980 phone numbers in 2006 to 17,835 by early 2009. According to officials, only 2,000 of those numbers met the standard set by FISC. 

<p>The revelations surrounding the <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this week a separate declassification <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/declassified-materials-show-nsa-surveilence-restrictions-reversed-in-2011.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] that some restrictions on the NSA were reversed in 2011 by FISC. Last week <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">The Guardian</a> [official website] obtained files <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/jurist-the-guardian-official-website-1.php">showing</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA and its UK counterpart compromised the guarantees that Internet companies have given consumers to reassure them that their communications are encrypted. The files, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?hp&_r=1&">published</a> [NYT report] in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> [official websites], reveal a 10-year NSA decryption program, making data through Internet cable taps exploitable. In June the ACLU, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Grand Chamber of the ECHR <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24047097">reasoned</a> [BBC report] that the extradition of the suspect, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, would worsen his mental and physical condition. The court also determined that the requested transfer would violate Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment. However, it expressly held that the recent decision was solely based on the seriousness and possible deterioration of the suspect's health. The ECHR decision is considered final, meaning that the British government cannot extradite Aswat to the US.

<p>Aswat's extradition was previously blocked in April. The ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspect-to-us.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that removing Aswat, a UK-based terror suspect whose nationality is unknown, to an American high-security prison would constitute "inhuman or degrading treatment," especially in light of the fact that Aswat suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. In July 2010 the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">stayed the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Aswat, Hamza and two other terrorism suspects from the UK to the US, holding that potential punishment could violate Human Rights Convention. The UK High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Aswat to the US in 2006. Aswat is wanted in the US on suspicion of setting up a terrorist training camp. The extradition was approved only after the US offered assurances that it would not seek the death penalty, try Aswat along with his cohort before military tribunals or declare them enemy combatants. Hamza was extradited and made his first US court appearance in October, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleading not guilty</a> [JURIST reports] to charges of terrorism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 42-page report was <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE98A0D520130911?sp=true">based on 258 interviews</a> [Reuters report] with refugees, conducted via Skype between May 15 and July 15. The interviews were done remotely because the 20 UN investigators have not been allowed to enter Syria. The investigators determined with high certainty that governmental forces were responsible for at least two massacres in which 450 civilians were killed. Moreover, they further reported that they received several allegations about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. They criticized the perpetrators of the crimes for not fearing accountability and for believing that a military victory is possible. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. On Tuesday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">Syrian government is likely responsible</a> [JURIST report] for the August 21 chemical weapon attacks. On Monday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-calls-for-negotiations-to-end-syria-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help facilitate negotiations between warring parties in Syria. Earlier this week JURIST guest columnist Curtis Doebbler <a href="/forum/2013/09/curtis-doebbler-force-syria.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law. Last week the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-senate-committee-approves-strike-on-syria.php">joint resolution</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the limited use of force against Syria. Also last week UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-questions-legality-of-potential-us-strike-on-syria.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the US plan to strike Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sipa70.pdf">Securities Investors Protection ACT</a> (SIPA) [text, PDF], defrauded investors are entitled to a return of their principal calculated with inflation and interest, known as <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/claims-03.html">"time-based damages"</a> [Madoff Recovery Initiative summary]. Judge Burton Lifland granted trustee Irving Picard's <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/document/dockets/004224-blmisorder08-01789docket5463.pdf">motion to limit</a> [text, PDF] the amounts distributed based on the grounds that the recovery pool is limited, and granting more than any one principal amount would drain the account before all investors are repaid even their initial principal amount. Some investors objected to the motion, arguing that such a calculation favors those who invested later, exposing themselves to less loss and actualized time-based damages. Liflano explained, "This Court recognizes that choosing any method for calculating net equity is particularly challenging in light of the complex and unique facts of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and each method will benefit some victims at the expense of others. Indeed, in this zero sum game 'whe[re] funds are limited, hard choices must be made.'" To date, recovery and <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/">settlement agreements</a> [official website] have been reached regarding $9.354 billion, while the litigation fees are already into the hundreds of millions.

<p>Madoff's scheme is believed to have defrauded investors of over <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/facts-08.html">$65 billion</a> [Madoff trustee summary]. In April a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-madoff-victims-suit-against-sec.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the victims' suit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission for negligence in not catching Madoff sooner. In July 2012 the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/madoff-trustee-asks-court-to-release-over-25-billion-for-victims.php">approved the first payouts</a> [JURIST report] to Madoff's victims. The trustee, Picard, filed almost <a href="paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010, including suits against large banks like JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. Judge Louis Stanton made Picard the trustee of Bernard L Madoff Securities, LLC in December 2008. Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison for securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme.

US District Judge Daniel Hovland had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/federal-judge-dismisses-genetic-defect-abortion-lawsuit-at-north-dakota-clinics-request/2013/09/11/abea2d76-1b1b-11e3-80ac-96205cacb45a_story.html">granted the request</a> [AP report] by the <a href="http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com/">Red River Women's Clinic</a> [clinic website] to drop the gender and genetic abnormalities part of the challenge on Monday. Still, the clinic is able to bring those challenges at a later time if it decides to do so. The clinic determined that the new law would not affect its abortion practice because it does it for reasons other than those specified in HB 1305. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website], which represents the Red River clinic, stated that it was not certain whether the new law would affect any women seeking abortion at the clinic.

<p>North Dakota's laws against abortion have been successfully challenged in the recent months. In early August Cass County District Court Judge Wickham Corwin <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/north-dakota-judge-blocks-abortion-law.php">granted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against legislation that would have forced the Red River Women's Clinic to close. The <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0796-03000.pdf?20130731164630">law</a> [SB 2305, PDF] imposes requirements that any physician performing abortions in the state must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, but the Red River Clinic is frequently forced to fly in physicians from out of state. Any physician who fails to comply with the admitting privileges requirement could be prosecuted for a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $3,000 fine. In July another North Dakota abortion law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of North Dakota. <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0304-02000.pdf?20130722170619">HB 1456</a> [text, PDF] is one of the <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/22/19618223-federal-judge-blocks-most-restrictive-abortion-law-in-the-country?lite">most restrictive abortion laws in the country</a> [NBC report] and would prohibit abortions after the point at which cardiac activity can be detected in a pregnancy, or as early as six weeks. North Dakota is one of many <a href="/feature/2013/07/state-abortion-restrictions.php">states</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to enact restrictive abortion laws in recently. Earlier in July a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-dakota-judge-strikes-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] another North Dakota law placing limitations on drug-induced abortions. The Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an abortion bill which bans abortions after 20 weeks. Also in July <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-senate-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wisconsin-governor-signs-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/ohio-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">Ohio</a> [JURIST reports] enacted laws which place restrictions on abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge William Conley for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] held that even if public employees have the right to associate, that right does not require employers to listen. He reasoned that the law does not prohibit employees to engage in collective bargaining but merely requires employers not to listen. Conley also accepted the argument that treating represented employees differently than unrepresented employees does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. He agreed that the differential treatment is "rationally related to Act 10's purpose of giving 'local governments the tools necessary to manage impending revenue reductions.'" It is still unclear whether the decision is going to be appealed.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill has been the subject of legal and political controversy since its passage. In April a judge for the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website]  <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/wisconsin-court-allows-challenge-to-collective-bargaining-law.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit to proceed, despite objections from the state's <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The <a href="http://www.wlea.org/">Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association</a> (WLEA) [union website], a public sector union, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/union-files-lawsuit-challenging-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November, contending that the Budget Repair Bill's limitations on unions' collective bargaining rights violates unions' association, speech, petition, advocacy and equal protection rights. In January 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-controversial-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] as a constitutional exercise of power. A Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-controversial-collective-bargaining-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law as it applies to school district and local government workers in September of last year. Wisconsin Attorney General JB Van Hollen <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-ag-appeals-ruling-striking-down-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] days later. In July 2012 the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to reopen a case challenging the Budget Repair Bill because of a justice's <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">refusal to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upholding</a> of Act 10 in June 2011 overturned a Dane County Circuit Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] that struck down the law for violations of the open meetings rule.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Robert Seldon Lady wrote to Italian <a href=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official profile], pleading to be pardoned and absolved for his role in kidnapping the Muslim cleric under the US extraordinary rendition policy. Last September the Italian Court of Cassation upheld Lady's conviction, as well as that of 22 other former CIA officers. 

<p>In April Napolitano pardoned US Air Force Colonel Joseph Romano of his conviction related to the CIA abduction and extraordinary rendition of Nasr. Joseph Romano was security chief of northern Italy's Aviano air base where Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was abducted prior to being flown to Egypt. Nasr was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007.

The regulation puts in place a single supervisory mechanism that will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/eu-lawmakers-set-to-vote-for-centralized-bank-oversight-authority-in-step-toward-banking-union/2013/09/12/7c97f6be-1b81-11e3-80ac-96205cacb45a_story.html">cover</a> [WP report] 150 of the largest banks in the 17 Eurozone nations, and allows other EU member states that do not utilize the euro to opt into the system. In a press release ECB President Mario Draghi stated:<blockquote>Today marks a real step forward in setting up a banking union, which is a core element of a genuine economic and monetary union. We will do our utmost to put in place all organisational requirements, with the aim of assuming our supervisory responsibilities one year after the legislation enters into force, and look forward to working with national authorities to contribute to the restoration of confidence in the banking sector</blockquote>The new regulation will enter into force following approval by the EU Council and will be operational by next year. 

<p>The ongoing European debt crisis has led to instability in the EU. Last November the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_6999/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the <a href="http://www.esm.europa.eu/">European Stability Mechanism</a> (ESM) [official website; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19870747">backgrounder</a>], is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports].

Al Jazeera has accused the regime of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/pressoffice/2013/08/201382014351649291.html">detaining journalists</a> [Al Jazeera report] without charges or on politically motivated charges, raiding Al Jazeera offices, confiscating equipment and jamming transmission of broadcasts. According to their press release, Al Jazeera has instructed its lawyers at <a href="http://www.carter-ruck.com/">Carter-Ruck</a> [firm website] to bring action against the Egyptian regime in international courts and before the UN. Also in the release a spokesperson from the news agency stated that, "Al Jazeera cannot permit this situation to continue. The right of journalists to report freely in situations of this kind is protected by international law and is reaffirmed by <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8929.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 1738</a>" [text]. Resolution 1738 condemns deliberate attacks and violence against journalists.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military deposed president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morsi">news archive</a>], in addition to suspending the nation's constitution and installing an interim government. Earlier in September an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-orders-closure-of-four-media-outlets.php">ordered</a> the closure of four media outlets, including an affiliate of Al Jazeera, for their alleged support of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>]. The Egyptian government reportedly <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/03/egypt-court-bans-local-al-jazeera-station-over-accusations-that-it-is-pro-muslim-brotherhood/">claims</a> [AP report] that Al-Jazeera's affiliate provided biased news coverage during Brotherhood protests following the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">removal</a> [JURIST report] of president Morsi in July. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

After the state's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 109-49 in favor of overriding Nixon's veto, the senate's 22-12 vote failed to meet the required two-thirds majority. Nixon vetoed the bill earlier this year, arguing that it violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution</a> [text], as well as an individual's free exercise of speech protected by both federal and state constitutions. <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills131/billpdf/truly/HB0436T.PDF">HB 436</a> [text, PDF] essentially nullified federal gun legislation, providing:<blockquote>Although the several states have granted supremacy to laws and treaties made pursuant to the powers granted in the Constitution, such supremacy does not apply to various federal statutes, orders, rules, regulations, or other actions which restrict or prohibit the manufacture, ownership, and use of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition exclusively within the borders of Missouri.</blockquote>The bill also made it illegal to "publish the name, address, or other identifying information of any individual who owns a firearm or who is an applicant for or holder of any license, certificate, permit, or endorsement which allows such individual to own, acquire, possess, or carry a firearm." 

<p>This is the latest development in the national gun control debate. Earlier this month the <a href="http://courts.ms.gov/appellate_courts/sc/sc.html">Mississippi Supreme Court</a> [official website] unanimously upheld Mississippi's <a href="http://openstates.org/ms/bills/2013/HB2/documents/MSD00053269/">House Bill 2</a> [text], which stipulates that gun owners do not need a special permit to carry a gun in a holster or carrying case, so long as it is at least partially visible. In August Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/illinois-governor-signs-gun-control-bill-into-law.php">signed a gun safety bill into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring background checks for all gun purchases in the state as well as the reporting of all lost and stolen guns. In May several groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a new Connecticut gun control law expanding the definition of "assault weapons," which are banned under existing state law. Earlier that month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-warns-kansas-on-new-gun-law.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Kansas that a recently enacted law intended to block enforcement of federal gun regulations was unconstitutional. In March a Kansas legislative committee approved a bill that would <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/03/kansas-lawmakers-approve-open-carry-and-transportation-law-for-firearms.php">allow the open carry</a> [JURIST report] and transport of firearms around the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Affirmed on nearly <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10304381/EU-market-regulator-has-no-power-to-ban-short-selling-says-top-adviser-to-European-Court-of-Justice.html">80 percent of final judgments</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], the ECJ's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, rejected the measure for lack of contribution to market harmonization and overreaching on the part of the European Union. Jaaskinen claims that the decision should be based on a unanimous vote among member states. The European Commission and ESMA have made <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/12/us-eu-shortselling-court-idUSBRE98B0FP20130912">no comment</a> [Reuters report] on Jaaskinen's statement. 

<p>Short selling has been the target of much criticism, particularly following the recent financial crisis. In 2009 the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website] made <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/sec-makes-rule-banning-naked-short.php">permanent</a> [JURIST report] a temporary ban on the so-called "naked" short selling of stocks. In a normal short sale, a trader borrows and sells a stock, promising to buy it back at a certain price in the future, but in a "naked" short sale, the trader doesn't actually borrow the stock before selling it. In its release announcing the retention of the rule, the SEC said that allowing the practice often left traders in a position where they could not deliver the stock, which would artificially drive down its value.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled "Northern Ireland: Time to Deal with the Past," speaks extensively about the failure of the government to deliver justice or accountability for the abuses. "Fifteen years after the signing of the <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/uploads/documents/Anglo-Irish/agreement.pdf">Belfast/Good Friday Agreement</a> [text], they&#8212;together with many victims of torture, ill-treatment, abductions and other human rights violations and abuses&#8212;are still waiting for truth, justice and reparation." The report places blame on the governments of both Ireland and the UK, claiming that they lack the will to investigate the truth. This report comes just two weeks before the start of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/ireland/cfr-president-richard-n-haass-chair-all-party-talks-northern-ireland/p31165">all-party talks</a> [CFR report], which are supposed to address many of the most divisive issues that Northern Ireland faces.  

<p>The UK did agree, in September, 2011, to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-to-pay-compensation-to-bloody-sunday-victims.php">compensate the victims</a> [JURIST report] of 1972's Bloody Sunday. The Bloody Sunday inquiry was the longest and most expensive public investigation in British legal history. The government <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/bloody-sunday-inquiry-enters-final.php">deposed more than 900 witnesses</a> [JURIST report] in 432 days of testimony and took more than 1,500 written statements. The soldiers held responsible for the killings attempted to take action against the inquiry in 2004, arguing against the use of any standard below the criminal standard of proof because of the potential consequences facing them. Inquiry Chairman Lord Saville of Newdigate determined that the <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/bloody-sunday-soldiers-may-take-court.php">tribunal would not use a criminal standard of proof</a> [JURIST report] to find if a soldier shot anyone without justification because the tribunal was merely investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths and issuing a report. The investigation came to fruition after the Irish government in 1997 produced new evidence that cast doubts on the conduct of the original tribunal established at the time of the incident, which labeled the victims as bombers and gunmen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Laurent Serubuga, now 77-years old, had been arrested in France in July on an international arrest warrant issued by Rwanda. The court stated that because the crimes of which Serabuga was accused occurred more than 10 years ago, the claims were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24064089">barred by the statute of limitations</a> [BBC report].  Additionally, the court held that at the time when the crimes were committed, genocide and crimes against humanity were not against the laws of Rwanda.  

<p>After the Rwandan genocide that took the lives of 800,000 people, international and domestic courts have attempted to try those responsible. In June <a href="http://worldjusticeproject.org/bio/honorary-chair/honorable-justice-jallow">Justice Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [WJP profile], prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] reiterated the UN Security Council's request for member states to help <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ictr-prosecutor-urges-member-states-to-assist-in-locating-rwanda-fugitives.php">bring to justice</a> [JURIST report] nine fugitives allegedly responsible for war crimes during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In July, a New Hampshire woman was <a href=/paperchase/2013/07/new-hampshire-woman-sentenced-to-10-years-for-role-in-rwandan-genocide.php">sentenced to 10 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison her her role in the genocide.  In April French law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan leader Tite Barahira for conspiracy to commit genocide. In March a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/dutch-court-convicts-woman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yvonne Basebya of inciting genocide after finding that she led meetings of a radical Hutu party and sang a song that called for the murder of all Tutsis. Basebya was sentenced to six years in prison. In February a court in Norway <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] a Rwandan man living in Oslo for acting as an accomplice to the genocide.

The amendments, which <a href="http://www.trust.org/item/20130912193250-gugpg">increase accountability for the use of public funds </a>[Reuters report], include political parties, the royal family, lobbies, unions and employers' associations. The new law will require all levels of government to provide clear public records concerning which companies have government contracts. The <a href="http://www.leydetransparencia.gob.es/anteproyecto/index.htm">current transparency law</a> [text, in Spanish] has been criticized for lacking these key features. Currently, Spain is the only EU country without a law guaranteeing citizens a right to information on how public funds are spent. I Advocacy groups such as <a href="http://www.transparencia.org.es/">Transparency International Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish], <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news/featur/spain_why_transparency_is_the_best_policy">encouraged</a> [press release] Parliament to pass the law in order to provide a strong legal framework against corruption. The bill is expected to pass both houses of Parliament.

<p>The funding of political parties has been a contentious issue in Spain recently, and the unclear funding of political parties has led to a series of scandals in the past decade. Currently, the governing <a href="http://www.pp.es/">People's Party</a> [official website] is under judicial investigation for alleged illegal financing. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/31/us-spain-corruption-idUSBRE90U0DD20130131">scandal</a> [Reuters report] involves politicians from the ruling political party who allegedly received kickbacks from a slush fund of corporate donations held in a Swiss bank. In June 2012 the Chief Justice of the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial/Tribunal_Supremo?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court of Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/spain-chief-justice-resigns-upon-embezzlement-accusations.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] over allegations that he used public funds for personal trips between 2008 and 2012. <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/21/actualidad/1340264631_786646.html">Carlos Divar</a> [El Pais profile], who was also the chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council, <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/21/actualidad/1340270371_628420.html">announced</a> [El Pais report] during a 20-member judicial oversight board meeting that he would step down from his position while rejecting the allegations against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

For the past two years, Mogadishu has been undergoing reconstruction, while tented camps continue being cleared for development. Some residents have been forced to move to the outskirts of the city, where security forces are unable to have effective control. Currently, more than 300,000 people are living in the nation's capital in basic camps. Urging the government to protect this vulnerable population, AI's Somalia researcher Gemma Davies stated that "[i]t is completely unacceptable for people who have fled to the capital for protection to be forcibly evicted. It has resulted in large scale human rights abuses." The evictions began in January 2013 when the Somali government announced a plan to relocate displaced people from Mogadishu to proposed camps outside the city to make way for reconstruction and development of the capital. In light of the human rights abuses, AI is urging the Somali government to halt all evictions until necessary safeguards are in place in line with its obligations under international human rights law. 

<p>Human rights violations of abuse and rape have been a continued concern in Somalia. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia0313_ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/26/somalia-protect-displaced-people-risk">press release</a>] revealing that displaced people in face the risk of physical abuse and rape. Also in March, a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government. That ruling followed the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">recommendation</a> [JURIST report] of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] to reopen the case. In February, Somalia's new prime minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid, said that the Somali authorities would become more involved in <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-pm-promises-to-increase-protection-to-rape-victims-journalists.php">protecting rape victims</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid=202">Montgomery County Register of Wills</a> [official website] court clerk Bruce Hanes issued 116 marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the state's Attorney General <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/theoffice.aspx?id=6794">Kathleen Kane</a> [official website] said the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/23/23.HTM">Pennsylvania Marriage Law</a> [text] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> under the US Supreme Court holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST reports]. Commonwealth Court Judge <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court-judges/president-judge-dan-pellegrini">Dan Pellegrini</a> [official profile] said that Hanes cannot disregard the law simply because he believes it to be unconstitutional. In the ruling, Pellegrini stated: <blockquote>Hanes has admittedly failed to comply with his mandatory ministerial public duty under the Marriage Law by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, by accepting the marriage certificates of same-sex couples, and by waiving the mandatory three-day waiting period, in violation of the express provisions of the Marriage Law. Even if Hanes is correct in his view that portions of the Marriage Law are unconstitutional, as noted above, the instant mandamus action is not the proper forum in which such a determination may be made.</blockquote> It is not yet clear how Pellegrini's decision will affect same-sex couples who have obtained marriage licenses from Hanes. 

<p>In August lawyers for the <a href="http://www.portal.health.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_of_health_home/17457">Pennsylvania Department of Health</a> and <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_pa_gov/20650">Governor Tom Corbett</a> [official websites] argued in a legal filing that Hanes' decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples is a separation-of-powers violation that "risks causing serious and limitless harm" in Pennsylvania. In July the Pennsylvania Department of Health <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/07/pa-doh-suing-county-clerk-for-issuing-marriage-licenses-to-same-sex-couples.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] in the Commonwealth Court seeking to stop Hanes from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Also in July the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania. The <a href="http://www.ogc.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/office_of_general_counsel_-_home/1198">Governor's Office of General Counsel</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.philly.com/documents/Ltr+to+Adrian+King+%28Whitewood%29+07-30-13%5B2%5D.pdf">wrote</a> [text, PDF] to the attorney general in defense of the Pennsylvania statute, arguing that Windsor does not strike down the state's marriage law, but just the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">Windsor</a> [opinion, PDF] ruling, courts across the country <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage%09">have been citing</a> [JURIST news archive] the decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order requires the department to achieve a population of 137.5 percent of design capacity no later than December 31, 2013. The bill appropriates $315 million this fiscal year to the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov">Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> [official website] for inmate housing. The bill explicitly states that the department's use of the funds is limited to avoid early release. Senate Bill 105 provides: <blockquote>This act will also provide time to develop additional thoughtful, balanced, and effective long-term solutions with input from the state's local government and justice partners who are still adjusting to the recent criminal justice reforms of realignment. The long-term changes will build upon the transition of lower level offenders to local jurisdiction, the construction of new prison health care facilities, and improvements to existing health care facilities throughout the prison system.</blockquote> The law was the result of an agreement between Governor Brown and legislators reached earlier this week.

<p>In August the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Calif-prison-release-order-8-2-13.pdf">refused to stay an injunction</a> [order, PDF] that would allow for the early release of nearly 10,000 California inmates by the end of the year. The six-justice majority offered no explanation for their ruling. Three justices dissented, calling the injunction a "terrible injunction." State officials, however, have argued that releasing the prisoners poses a risk to public safety. The state plans to appeal the the decision on the merits of the case.The Supreme Court's decision is the end of a legal battle that began when the US <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/">District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] first <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-April-2013/Coleman-Termination-Order.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in 1995 that mental health and medical care for inmates was so bad that the state's prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. In 2006 the state's governor proclaimed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=4278">prison overcrowding state of emergency</a> [text]. In May 2011 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an order to reduce California's prison population in <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/USSC-Plata-opinion09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a> [opinion, PDF]. The court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] because it prevented the system from providing adequate medical and mental health care to inmates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which the <a href="http://senate.ca.gov/">California Senate</a> [official website] passed hours earlier, directs California's Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to people without a social security number who can prove they are authorized to be in the US under federal law. The bill justifies allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses by citing an Obama administration <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">policy directive</a> [memorandum, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">report</a>] known as Deferred Action, which halts deportation proceedings against some immigrants who came to the US as children. <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill into law, <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18203">stating</a> [press release], "This bill will enable millions of people to get to work safely and legally. Hopefully, it will send a message to Washington that immigration reform is long past due." Passage of this bill will <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/13/california-lawmakers-approve-driver-licenses-for-illegal-immigrants/#ixzz2en52cWjq">make California the tenth state</a> [AP report] allowing certain undoccumented immigrants to apply for licenses.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a hotly debated issue over the past few years when states, beginning with Arizona, passed laws giving state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Last year Kansas <a href="http://www.kriskobach.org/">Secretary of State Kris Kobach</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-secretary-of-state-challenges-obama-administration-immigration-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Deferred Action policy directive. Also last year the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">partially struck down</a> [JURIST report] Alabama and Georgia's immigration laws, upholding only certain provisions. Earlier in 2012 Utah's Attorney General argued that the state's restrictive immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/utah-attorney-general-immigration-law-should-be-upheld-given-supreme-court-ruling.php">should be upheld</a> [JURIST report] in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf">Arizona v.

The report is based on interviews with residents from al-Bayda and Baniyas, including witnesses who saw or heard forces detain and then execute their relatives. The advocacy group determined from the witness accounts as well as from video evidence that the vast majority of individuals were executed after military clashes had ended and opposition fighters had retreated. The Syrian government previously acknowledged military operations in the coastal towns but said that its forces had killed only "terrorists." Regarding the executions, Joe Stork, acting Middle East director of HRW, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/13/syria-mass-executions-government-forces">stated</a> [press release], "While the world's attention is on ensuring that Syria's government can no longer use chemical weapons against its population, we shouldn't forget that Syrian government forces have used conventional means to slaughter civilians." HRW recommended that the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for review.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. On Tuesday HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government is likely responsible for the August 21 chemical weapon attacks. On Monday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-calls-for-negotiations-to-end-syria-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help facilitate negotiations between warring parties in Syria. Earlier this week JURIST guest columnist Curtis Doebbler <a href="/forum/2013/09/curtis-doebbler-force-syria.php">argued</a> that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law, while guest columnist Jordan Paust <a href="/forum/2013/09/jordan-paust-force-syria.php">provided several legal justifications</a> [JURIST op-eds] under the UN Charter for the use of force in Syria. Last week the <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-senate-committee-approves-strike-on-syria.php">joint resolution</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the limited use of force against Syria. Also last week UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-questions-legality-of-potential-us-strike-on-syria.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the US plan to strike Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The constitutional amendment, passed in 2004 with approval of 75 percent of voters, allows only a marriage between man and woman to be valid or recognized. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, argues that this amendment was passed in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the US Constitution. In addition, the organization claims that such violations are prohibited by <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Legresou/Constitu/002.htm">Section 2</a> [text] of Kentucky's Constitution, guaranteeing freedom from "absolute and arbitrary power."

<p>The heated debate over same-sex marriage is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Last week an Ohio judge issued an order allowing a Cincinnati man to be <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">listed as "spouse"</a> [JURIST report] on the death certificate of his late husband. In August the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">US Treasury Department</a> [official website] announced that the Treasury, along with the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] will now recognize the marriages of all same-sex couples for <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">federal tax purposes</a> [JURIST report]. Also in August a judge for the <a href="http://seconddistrictcourt.nmcourts.gov/">Second Judicial District Court of New Mexico</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-mexico-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] district court clerks to begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The week before, the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Supreme Court </a>[official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">consider whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts. In July the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage.

The interim government has sent military troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers into the city streets, claiming that extraordinary measures are needed to fight the war on terrorism. Constitutionally, the interim government may only impose a state of emergency for three months before it is subject to a public referendum. Thursday's extension is widely believed to be a response to recent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24046153">suicide bombings</a> [BBC report], which were done in protest to Egypt's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=220297095">raid of suspected al Qaeda hideouts</a> [NPR report].

<p>Emergency laws were implemented in mid-August amid <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-secretary-general-condemns-violence-in-egypt.php">violent clashes</a> [JURIST report] in the streets of Cairo, where police troops dispersed two protest encampments, leaving at least <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/14/211899204/deaths-reported-in-cairo-as-forces-move-on-morsi-supporters">275 killed and more than 2,000 injured</a> [NPR report]. In subsequent days, the spread of violence claimed the lives of almost 1,000 people. The protests were attended by supporters of ousted president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">news archive</a>], including the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>]. In July the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed </a>[JURIST report] Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. This marked the peak of conflict in the nation, which has faced unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website]. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Mansour, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state on the same day that Morsi was deposed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/13/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE98C0QK20130913">accused</a> [Reuters report] Assad of committing "many crimes against humanity," though he did not say whether it was Assad's forces or rebels who used the chemical weapons in the August 21 attack. The tentative date for Ban's presentation on the expert team's report on the August 21 attack is Monday.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Syria's main opposition group in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-urged-to-probe-alleged-abuses-by-syrian-president.php">urged the UN to probe</a> numerous massacres they say were committed during Ramadan by forces loyal to Assad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=331">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Friday that the US government does not have to release photographs and videotapes taken during the investigation of Mohammed al-Qahtani's connection to the September 11 attacks. Al-Qahtani was held in <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] until his charges were eventually dropped. The videotapes depict al-Qahtani's interrogations, something the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2012-01-09%20CCR%20v.%20DOD%20et%20al.pdf">claims should be public record</a> [complaint, PDF]. However, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald stated in the order:<blockquote>Ultimately, however, we find that the DOD's submissions provide adequate justification for the Government's invocation of [Freedom of Information Act] Exemption 1. In particular, we find it both logical and plausible that extremists would utilize images of al-Qahtani (whether in native or manipulated formats) to incite anti-American sentiment, to raise funds, and/or to recruit other loyalists, as has occurred in the past.</blockquote>The cited exemption refers to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">5 USC &#167; 552(b)(1)(A)</a> [text]. Further, Buchwald noted that she reviewed the tapes and images and determined that, contrary to the CCR's position, they do not display any misconduct by government officials. Therefore, there was no reason the government's stated exemption to the Freedom of Information Act should not apply.

<p>This is the most recent development in the several controversies surrounding Guantanamo Bay. Last month the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainees-to-algeria.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria. In July a US court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-guards-allowed-to-continue-detainee-genital-searches.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Guantanamo guards were allowed to continue detainee genital searches. In June a federal judge called on members of Congress and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo detainee cases. Just days prior Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sepulveda highlighted the need to improve the access to mandatory education for children with disabilities as well as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/feature-stories/europes-roma-community-still-facing-massive-discrimination-20090408">Romani</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">news archive</a>] children. While Sepulveda noted that Moldova has remained committed to improving its legal system, she emphasized the need for continued improvement in terms of implementing new laws. She further called for more to be done to end the discrimination of the Romani people that contributes to their high poverty rates. In accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Sepulveda encouraged reforms to guardianship and adult deinstitutionalization programs. The complete report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council next June.

<p>Moldova's human rights record has come into question recently. In July <a href="http://www.amnesty.md/">Amnesty International Moldova</a> (AI) [advocacy website, in Romanian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-group-condemns-moldova-chemical-castration-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Moldova's chemical castration law.

The rights of the Romani people have also been controversial. In April aUN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-expert-eu-must-do-more-to-support-roma-peoples.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU member states to do more to ensure that Roma peoples receive the support necessary to fully enjoy all their basic human rights.

The order comes in response to a <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/aclu-misc-13-02.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] filed by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] directly to FISC requesting the publication of its opinions dealing with the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] phone record collections. The court has required the government to create a list of which opinions are subject to the ACLU's FOIA litigation by October 4, 2013. The government must also propose a timetable to complete a declassification review and submit to the court its proposed redactions for each opinion. After the government's review and submission, the authors of each opinion will decide whether to propose their opinion's publication.

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week, a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/declassified-materials-show-nsa-surveilence-restrictions-reversed-in-2011.php">report</a> [JURIST report] released by the <em>Washington Post</em> revealed that the Obama administration won permission from the FISC in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the NSA's use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">The Guardian</a> [official website] obtained files <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/jurist-the-guardian-official-website-1.php">showing</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA and its UK counterpart, the <a href="http://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx">Government Communications Headquarters</a> (GCHQ) [official website], compromised the guarantees that Internet companies have given consumers to reassure them that their communications are encrypted. The files, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?hp&_r=1&">published</a> [NYT report] in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> [official websites], reveal a 10-year NSA decryption program, making data through Internet cable taps exploitable. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

CWC signatories must agree to "chemically disarm" by destroying chemical weapon stockpiles and creating enforcement mechanisms to ensure that chemical weapons will not be produced, acquired or transferred within their jurisdiction. Signatories must also agree to allow other member states "anytime, anywhere" inspection-power without the right to refuse. Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile] announced Syria's formal agreement Thursday, stating the CWC will enter into force October 14. Right groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government of responsibility for August 21 chemical weapon attacks, which allegedly involved the use of sarin nerve gas. Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45852&Cr=Syria&Cr1=#.UjX8qBZA_zI">expressed</a> [UN News Centre report] his "fervent hope" that the agreement will prevent futures uses of chemical weapons in Syria.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad. The increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Syria's main opposition group in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-urged-to-probe-alleged-abuses-by-syrian-president.php">urged the UN</a> [JURIST report] to probe numerous massacres they say were committed during Ramadan by forces loyal to Assad. In July the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-bring-peace-to-syria.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to bring peace the country. In May UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding reports that described the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting began between Syrian Government forces and opposition groups seeking to oust Assad. Almost two million have fled to neighboring countries and a further 4 million have been internally displaced. JURIST Guest Columnist Enver Hasani of the University of Prishtina in Kosovo argued in September that regime change in Syria will <a href="/forum/2013/09/enver-hasani-syria-purgatory.php">represent a profound geopolitical shift</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2008 Chicago police arrested a man for allegedly brandishing a firearm during an altercation with the police. A Cook County court found the defendant guilty of carrying an "uncased, loaded and immediately accessible" handgun and sentenced him to 24 months probation. However, in 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] found that the law imposed a "flat ban on carrying ready-to-use guns outside the home" in violation of the Second Amendment and US Supreme Court precedent. The state high court agreed with Seventh Circuit's reasoning, finding that the Second Amendment confers a limited right to legally bear arms in places "beyond the home." According to media sources, the decision <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-guns-supreme-court-20130914,0,5828194.story">mandates</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] that state prosecutors drop "aggravated weapon use" charges pending against a small number of people accused with the crime. 

<p>The Illinois Supreme Court's decision is the latest development in the national gun control debate. In November the Missouri Senate fell one vote short of <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/missouri-lawmakers-fail-to-overcome-veto-of-gun-bill.php">overriding a veto</a> [JURIST report] by Governor Jay Nixon and passing into law a bill implementing a controversial gun measure. Earlier in September the Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously upheld Mississippi's House Bill 2, which stipulates that gun owners do not need a special permit to carry a gun in a holster or carrying case, so long as it is at least partially visible. In August Illinois Governor Pat Quinn <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/illinois-governor-signs-gun-control-bill-into-law.php">signed a gun safety bill into law</a> [JURIST report] requiring background checks for all gun purchases in the state as well as the reporting of all lost and stolen guns. In May several groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a new Connecticut gun control law expanding the definition of "assault weapons," which are banned under existing state law. Earlier that month US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-warns-kansas-on-new-gun-law.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Kansas that a recently enacted law intended to block enforcement of federal gun regulations was unconstitutional. In March a Kansas legislative committee approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kansas-lawmakers-approve-open-carry-and-transportation-law-for-firearms.php">allow the open carry</a> [JURIST report] and transport of firearms around the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bahrain is <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/15/bahrain-security-forces-detaining-children">specifically accused</a> [press release] of violating the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], ratified by Bahrain in 1992, by failing to protect children from "ill-treatment" and torture, separate them from adults in detention, and providing access to legal assistance. HRW concluded its report with the recommendation that Bahrain conduct investigations into allegations of torture and cease its widespread detention of children and only detain anyone under 18 as a last resort.

<p>Bahrain has faced civil unrest as Shiite-led protesters seek political empowerment in the Sunni-ruled country. In July the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14540571">Bahrain National Assembly</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bahrain-national-assembly-enacts-new-anti-terrorism-laws.php">approved laws</a> [JURIST report] increasing penalties for those who commit or incite terrorism as an effort to half the "dangerous escalation" of unrest and political tensions. Earlier that month 29 protesters were <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bahrain-protesters-jailed-for-entering-heavily-guarded-area.php">sentenced to one month in prison</a> [JURIST report] for entering Pearl Square, the heavily fortified area that was once the center of Bahrain's anti-government uprising. Last month three protesters were <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/bahrain-court-sentences-protesters-up-to-15-years.php">sentenced to imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for taking party in anti-government protests as well as attempting to kill a police officer. In May a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bahrain-court-jails-6-for-insulting-tweets.php">sentenced six individuals</a> [JURIST report] to a year in prison for insulting King Hamad via Twitter. Also in May a Bahrain court issued <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bahrain-court-sentences-protesters-to-15-years.php">15-year prison sentences</a> [JURIST report] to 31 protesters for their role in firebomb attacks as part of anti-government protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.fb.org/">American Farm Bureau Federation</a> (AFBF) [advocacy website] initially <a href="http://www.fb.org/legal/files/id_51/2011.01.10%20AFBF%20Complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2011, alleging that the TMDL "unlawfully circumvented" the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [text, PDF], which gives primary authority to state governments to protect water quality. Judge Sylvia Rambo <a href="http://cumberlink.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/u-s-judge-rejects-farm-industry-groups-challenge-against-epa/article_10d34416-1e0a-11e3-960b-001a4bcf887a.html">held</a> [AP report] that the TMDL did not violate the CWA because the EPA and the states all agreed to it, and the states were given the flexibility to decide how to meet the limits. 

<p><a href="http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/agriculture.cfm">Agricultural runoff</a> [EPA materials], such as animal waste and fertilizer, is the single largest source of pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay. To date, more than 47,000 water pollution-reduction plans have been completed throughout the United States, and the Chesapeake Bay plan is the largest and most complex so far. Efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay water quality were initiated in 1983 with the first <a href="http://www.chesapeakebay.net/content/publications/cbp_12512.pdf">Chesapeake Bay Agreement</a> [text, PDF], signed by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, the mayor of Washington, DC, and the head of the EPA. However, it was not until 2000 that concrete steps were taken towards establishment of a pollution-reduction program with the <a href="http://www.chesapeakebay.net/content/publications/cbp_12081.pdf">Chesapeake 2000 Agreement</a> [text, PDF], then signed by the governors of Virgina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, the mayor of Washington, D.C., the head of the EPA, and the newly created <a href="http://www.chesbay.us/">Chesapeake Bay Commission</a> [advocacy website]. In 2002, the states of New York, Delaware and West Virginia joined the agreement by a <a href="http://www.chesapeakebay.net/content/publications/cbp_12085.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> [text,PDF]. All the signatory entities agreed to establish a pollution-reduction program by May 1, 2011, and to reach the targeted limits by 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers for the five men, who have been charged with plotting and aiding the attacks, asked the government to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/judge-guantanamo-pause-911-case-20266239">create a new and secure computer system</a> [AP report], a process that could take several months. Lawyers for both sides will testify on the computer issue on Monday. The judge has not yet set a trial date.

<p>This is the most recent development in the several recent controversies surrounding Guantanamo Bay. Earlier this week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/judge-rules-us-government-does-not-have-to-release-investigation-videotapes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the US government does not have to release photographs and videotapes taken during the investigation of Mohammed al-Qahtani's connection to the 9/11 attacks. Last month the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainees-to-algeria.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria. In July a US court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-guards-allowed-to-continue-detainee-genital-searches.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Guantanamo guards were allowed to continue detainee genital searches. In June a federal judge called on members of Congress and President Barack Obama to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo detainee cases. Just days prior Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo. The appointment followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama made in May that outlined US counterterrorism policy and efforts. In April JURIST guest columnist David Frakt <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST op-ed] to release those detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontniqab.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge in London <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/story/2013-09-16/muslim-woman-veil-court-decision/">ruled</a> [materials] on Monday that a Muslim woman who is a defendant in an upcoming trial must remove her full-face veil when presenting evidence. A judge for the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/places/blackfriars-crown-court">Blackfriars Crown Court</a> [official website] held that the woman, whose name cannot be identified for legal reasons, may wear her niqab, a garment that covers nearly her whole face, during most of the trial, but <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2421893/Muslim-woman-allowed-stand-trial-face-veil--REMOVE-evidence.html">must remove it when presenting evidence to the court</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report]. The judge <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24112067">emphasized</a> [BBC report] that it was important for the jury to see the defendant in order to assess her testimony. In reaching his decision the judge tried to balance the woman's religious beliefs with the court's need to weigh the credibility of witnesses:<blockquote>In general, the defendant is free to wear the niqab during trial. If the defendant gives evidence she must remove the niqab throughout her evidence. The court may use its inherent powers to do what it can to alleviate any discomfort, for example by allowing the use of screens or allowing her to give evidence by live link.</blockquote>The woman's lawyer is considering appealing the judge's decision.

<p>Niqabs, burqas and other traditional Muslim garments have been a controversial subject. Last week a Quebec official <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/quebec-official-proposes-bill-banning-religious-headwear-for-public-workers.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] banning religious headwear for public workers. Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banned</a> [JURIST report] burqas in July 2011. France's ban on burqas <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-burqa-ban-to-take-effect-april-11.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in April 2011. Some commentators have suggested that the rationales behind the European burqa bans are <a href="/forum/2012/02/maurits-berger-burqa-ban.php">weak</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the true purpose of the bills is societal discomfort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The unanimous decision was reached by a panel of nine supreme court justices who found that the law violated human rights.

<p>The issue of <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">undocumented immigration</a> [JURIST backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=immigration">news archive</a>] has been a controversial issue throughout the world.

A <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/content/slideshow/Secretary_General_Report_of_CW_Investigation.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] issued by chief weapons inspector <a href="http://www.umu.se/sok/english/staff-directory/view-person?uid=asel0001&guise=employee204574">Ake Sellstrom</a> [official profile] has found <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/convincing-evidence-of-chemical-weapons-attack-in-syria-un-inspectors-1.1456372">clear and convincing evidence</a> [AP report] of the use of sarin gas against civilians in Syria. A team of UN inspectors were investigating alleged chemical attacks that took place in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21. The investigation was confined to authenticating the use of chemical weapons and determining what types of chemical weapons were used. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] is expected to present the report to the UN Security Council later Monday. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad.

The nation's anti-graft commission accused Bandaranayake of allegedly failing to disclose empty bank accounts during a required declaration of assets while she was in office. If found guilty, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/46817244.pdf">Bribery Act</a> [text, PDF], Bandaranayake may face a fine as large as 5,000 rupees and seven years imprisonment. Many lawyers have already offered their support to the former chief justice in belief that the allegation is wholly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ilMGaD0Ng3y2eqQWQ55DSkD5tDMQ?docId%3DCNG.00fd7704369c3d85e34f3211f8541742.2e1">frivolous</a> [AFP report]. A Colombo magistrate impounded Bandaranayake's passport and scheduled the hearing for February.

<p>In addition to becoming Sri Lanka's first female chief justice, Bandaranayake also made national history as the first judge to be impeached. Amid controversy, Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-president-signs-order-removing-chief-justice-from-office.php">signed the order</a> to remove Bandaranayake from office in January after the Sri Lankan parliament voted in an overwhelming majority to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-parliament-votes-to-impeach-chief-justice.php">impeach the chief justice</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier that month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the chief justice's impeachment proceedings, saying they were "extremely politicized and characterized by lack of transparency, lack of clarity in the proceedings, as well as lack of respect for the fundamental guarantees of due process and fair trial." In December Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">guilty verdict</a> [JURIST reports] reached earlier that month by a parliamentary committee on three charges of misconduct.

A <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/content/slideshow/Secretary_General_Report_of_CW_Investigation.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] issued by chief weapons inspector <a href="http://www.umu.se/sok/english/staff-directory/view-person?uid=asel0001&guise=employee204574">Ake Sellstrom</a> [official profile], and released by Ban earlier Monday, provides "overwhelming and indisputable" evidence of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-war-crimes-panel-investigating-14-suspected-chemical-attacks-in-syria.php">use of sarin gas</a> [JURIST report] against civilians in Syria. "The findings are beyond doubt and beyond the pale," Ban said, reporting that 85 percent of blood samples tested positive for sarin and a majority of rockets and rocket fragments were found to be carrying sarin. Ban also welcomed the agreement between the Russian Federation and the US on a framework to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons, and urged the Security Council to ensure enforcement and compliance with the plan:<blockquote>The international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare ... There must be accountability for the use of chemical weapons. Any use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is a crime. But our message today must be more than: Do not slaughter your people with gas. There must also be no impunity for the crimes being committed with conventional weapons.</blockquote>However, it is still unclear who is responsible for the chemical attack. Ban concluded that "it is for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility."

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad. Last week Ban <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-praises-syria-for-signing-chemical-weapons-ban.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government's formal agreement to sign and abide by the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=6357">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">OPCD</a> backgrounder]. CWC signatories must agree to "chemically disarm" by destroying chemical weapon stockpiles and creating enforcement mechanisms to ensure that chemical weapons will not be produced, acquired or transferred within their jurisdiction. Rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government of responsibility for August 21 chemical weapon attacks, which allegedly involved the use of sarin nerve gas. Syria's main opposition group in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-urged-to-probe-alleged-abuses-by-syrian-president.php">urged the UN</a> [JURIST report] to probe numerous massacres they say were committed during Ramadan by forces loyal to Assad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Islamist extremists are believed to be behind <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/meast/egypt-church-attacks/index.html">attacks</a> [CNN report] such as the burning of churches and property owned by Christians, along with the displacement of Christian citizens. Coptic Christians comprise roughly 10 percent of the country's 85 million people. These citizens have become a scapegoat for the ouster of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">news archive</a>], and recent attacks are widely seen as retaliation from Morsi supporters, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>]. The NCHR joins other human rights organizations, such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/21/egypt-mass-attacks-churches">call</a> [press release] for Egyptian authorities to take action in protecting religious institutions from further persecution. In addition to Monday's condemnation, the NCHR announced its plans to form a special committee that will write a comprehensive report about the attacks.

<p>The threat to Christians came to a climax amid <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-secretary-general-condemns-violence-in-egypt.php">violent clashes</a> [JURIST report] in the streets of Cairo, where police troops dispersed two protest encampments, leaving at least <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/14/211899204/deaths-reported-in-cairo-as-forces-move-on-morsi-supporters">275 killed and more than 2,000 injured</a> [NPR report]. In subsequent days, the spread of violence claimed the lives of almost 1,000 people. The protests were predominantly attended by the Muslim Brotherhood. In July the Egyptian military <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">deposed</a> [JURIST report] Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. This marked the peak of conflict in the nation, which has faced unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Only one day after Morsi's ouster, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypts-interim-government-takes-action-against-pro-morsi-media.php">shut down four Islamist-run television stations</a> [JURIST report], causing concern among groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website]. The Chairman of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, Mansour, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/chairman-of-egypts-constitutional-court-sworn-in-as-interim-head-of-state.php">took the oath</a> [JURIST report] to become the interim head of state on the same day that Morsi was deposed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief prosecutors assert that, between 2007 and 2009, three current senators and dozens of former lawmakers <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/news/464825">conspired</a> [AP report] with businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles to set up false charity organizations that attracted government funds. A government audit uncovered the illegal activity in 2009. According to media reports, the defendants are charged with "plunder," bribery, corruption and misuse of public office. 

<p>Government corruption continues to be a global problem. Earlier in September Spanish lawmakers passed amendments to Spain's freedom of information law that aim to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/spain-passes-transparency-law.php">combat political corruption</a> [JURIST report]. The amendments, which increase accountability for the use of public funds, include political parties, the royal family, lobbies, unions and employers' associations. Also in September a lawmaker within Myanmar's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/myanmar-proposes-law-to-scrutinize-judicial-proceedings.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the legislative body intends to draft a bill that forms groups to monitor corruption in court proceedings. During the same timeframe the Chinese Ministry of Supervision began <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/china-asset-regulator-under-investigation-for-corruption.php">investigating</a> [JURIST repor] Jiang Jiemin, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The investigation stems from Jiemin's alleged involvement in an undisclosed "serious discipline violation." Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-liberia-police-corruption-poses-serious-threat-to-justice.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in August that widespread police corruption in Liberia is denying Liberians equal and impartial justice and impeding the country's postwar development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/CommissionInquiryonHRinDPRK.aspx">Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-council-to-investigate-north-korea-human-rights-violations.php">established in March</a> [JURIST report] in response to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.57_English.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-international-inquiry-into-north-korea-violations.php?edition=world">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/kp/mandate/index.htm">UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in North Korea</a> [official website] urging UN oversight and indicating widespread human rights violations including those of the right to food, pervasive impunity, torture, circumscription of due process, public executions and enforced disappearances. The commission visited Seoul and Tokyo in August, holding public hearings in order to receive testimony from victims and experts regarding these alleged abuses. The testimonies of various individuals pointed to what the commission referred to as "widespread and serious violations" of human rights, including torture, imprisonment, forcible repatriation and sexual violence. Michael Kirby, chairperson of the commission, stated that North Korea had not yet cooperated with the commission, but that the commission planned to pursue alternative means to open an impartial dialogue with the government. North Korea ultimately <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-rejects-u-n-rights-report-political-085409629.html">rejected the commission's findings</a> [Reuters report].

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter human rights abuses occurring in North Korea in the past. In February Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts announced their <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">support for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps. Also in February Darusman urged the UNHRC and the General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea. In November he also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the country's lack of development in human rights, and called on its new leader, Kim Jong-un, to remedy the matter. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php">condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the decrease in the number of individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdowns on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This overturned a February ruling by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTB">news archive</a>], which sentenced Mollah to life in prison for crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The life sentence triggered protests by both supporters of JI, as well as people hoping that Mollah would receive a death sentence. In response to these protesters, the Bangladesh parliament <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/us-bangladesh-warcrimes-idUSBRE98G05Z20130917">amended the law</a> [Reuters report] to allow the state to appeal any  sentence passed by the ICTB. Mollah's defense counsel stated that the sentence was politically motivated and said that he would file a petition for a review.

<p>Bangladesh has suffered in recent months from a wave of violent protests over war crimes convictions against leaders of the JI party. In July Ali Ahsan Mojaheed was found <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-death-for-war-crimes.php">guilty of five charges</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTB, including those of kidnapping and killing a journalist, a music director and a number of other people during the war. Also in July Ghulam Azam, chief of JI in Bangladesh until 2000, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-90-years-for-war-crimes.php">found guilty by the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] of five charges of planning, conspiracy, incitement, complicity and murder during the war. In the same month, ATM Azharul Islam was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-charges-islamic-leader-with-1971-war-crimes.php">required to report to the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] to answer charges of murder, genocide, abduction, torture, rape, looting and arson. The ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-begins-first-trial.php">began its first trial</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011 and was first <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to handle war crime charges stemming from the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pinheiro stated that both the groups have caused civilian deaths and had staged attacks on medical personnel and hospitals. Syria's representative said that the Commission of Inquiry had strayed into the "labyrinth of exaggeration" and stated that they had provided more than 250 documents to the Commission which had been ignored. The debate over whether international action in Syria is warranted has become increasingly urgent in light of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-confirms-chemical-attacks-in-syria.php">use of chemical weapons</a> [JURIST report] on August 21.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad. Last week UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-praises-syria-for-signing-chemical-weapons-ban.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government's formal agreement to sign and abide by the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=6357">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [text, PDF; OPCD <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">backgrounder</a>]. CWC signatories must agree to "chemically disarm" by destroying chemical weapon stockpiles and creating enforcement mechanisms to ensure that chemical weapons will not be produced, acquired or transferred within their jurisdiction. Rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government of responsibility for August 21 chemical weapon attacks, which allegedly involved the use of sarin nerve gas. Syria's main opposition group in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-urged-to-probe-alleged-abuses-by-syrian-president.php">urged the UN</a> [JURIST report] to probe numerous massacres they say were committed during Ramadan by forces loyal to Assad.

The report states that the FBI's excessive secrecy has limited oversight and stated that "it took unauthorized leaks by a whistleblower to finally reveal the government's secret interpretation of these laws and the Orwellian scope of its domestic surveillance programs." The ACLU also advocated for 15 specific reforms of FBI powers, including the agency's ability to obtain account information from telecommunications companies, financial institutions and credit agencies without judicial approval and the agency's warrantless wiretapping. The ACLU stated:<blockquote>The abuse, enabled by a roll-back of post-Watergate intelligence reforms and encouraged by long-standing Justice Department and FBI practices, has subverted internal and external oversight by squelching whistleblowers, imposing and enforcing unnecessary secrecy, and actively misleading Congress and the American people.</blockquote>The report was released to coincide with the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/james-b.-comey-sworn-in-as-fbi-director">swearing in of James Comey</a> [press release] as the director of the FBI earlier this month.

<p>The revelations surrounding US surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last month the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. In June the ACLU in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the NSA <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php">surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged, raise <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">significant First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is the son of Essam el-Haddad, a former adviser to Morsi, who is currently in detention.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the Egyptian military deposed president Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. Last week the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-extends-state-of-emergency-for-two-months.php">extended emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] put in place in mid-August.

Limaj was accused of killing and torturing Serbian prisoners at a Kosovo Liberation Army-run detention camp. The case was marked by the <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=28&nav_id=76608">suicide of the prosecution's chief witness</a> [B92 report], Agim Zogaj, in 2011. The court reasoned that although Zogaj could not testify, the information he provided was unreliable, and there was no independent evidence that proved that Limaj was the perpetrator of the crimes of which he was accused. This ruling marked the third time that Limaj has been acquitted of war crimes allegedly committed during the 1998-99 ethnic Albanian guerrilla insurgency in the former Serbian province. His <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/retrial-begins-against-kosovo-politician-accused-of-war-crimes.php">retrial began</a> [JURIST report] in April. 

<p>Limaj was previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/kosovo-politician-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">tried</a> in 2011 and was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/kosovo-politican-acquitted-on-war-crimes-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST reports] in May 2012. Limaj was excluded from a cabinet position following international pressure not to include corrupt officials but was elected into the Kosovo parliament. Limaj is an ex-member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and is viewed as a liberator by many ethnic Albanians. In 2005 Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. An EU judge in September 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-judge-places-senior-kosovo-politician-under-house-arrest-on-suspicion-of-war-crimes.php">placed Limaj under house arrest</a> after EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-kosovo-authorities-charge-10-for-war-crimes.php">charged 10 former members of the KLA</a> [JURIST reports], including Limaj, with war crimes for their actions during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Soyler, a Turkish national who was sentenced to five years for drawing checks without having sufficient funds, brought the suit after he was not allowed to vote in the 2011 Turkish general elections even after his conditional release from prison in 2009. Turkish law dictates that convicted persons are unable to vote while serving their sentences, with disenfranchisement continuing until the end of the period of the original sentence, regardless of early release from prison on probation. A unanimous court found that the automatic and indiscriminate ban on prisoners' voting rights violated Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human rights, which ensures the right to free elections, and "had to be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of maneuver of a State to decide on such matters as the electoral rights of convicted prisoners." The judgment will become final after three months, if a party does not request further examination from the ECHR's Grand Chamber.  

<p>Turkey has recently received criticism regarding human rights, particularly following the violent protests that began in Istanbul this summer. In July the Council of Europe (COE) Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/europe-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-of-turkish-police-response-to-protests.php">urged an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Turkey's "extremely disproportionate" use of police force against anti-government protesters. In June the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Turkish government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-office-urges-turkey-to-ensure-right-to-assembly.php">ensure the rights of its citizens</a> [JURIST report] to assemble freely and in a peaceful manner. Earlier in June the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights commended the Turkish government's decision to delay government construction that was being protested by Turkish citizens and <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-urges-turkish-government-protesters-to-defuse-tensions.php">urged authorities to work to defuse tensions</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June, the Human Rights Watch called on Turkish police to use <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-turkey-should-end-police-violence-against-protestors.php">non-violent tactics</a> [JURIST report] against citizen protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yemen's National Dialogue conference was created to bring Yemeni society together to decide the country's future. In a letter addressed to Chairperson Arwa Othman, Executive Director of the HRW Women's Rights Division Liesl Gerntholtz listed seven key issues affecting women's rights&#8212;equality, non-discrimination, political parties, violence against women, personal status law, child marriage and nationality rights&#8212;and a series of recommendations for constitutional provisions which would ensure equal rights. "Action is ... needed to ensure that women enjoy equality before the law with men. Currently, under Yemeni law, women do not enjoy such equality: for example, in legal proceedings, the testimony of a woman is valued at only half that of a man. This situation cannot be allowed to persist." HRW also offered to meet with the Rights and Freedoms group in Yemen to help incorporate their recommendations.

<p>Yemen has been in a state of transition since the anti-government uprising in 2011. In April 2011 former president Ali Abdullah Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down from power</a> [JURIST report], ending his 32-year reign as the nation's leader, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Earlier that month Amnesty International released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">urging the international community</a> [JURIST report] to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate the deaths of protesters. Earlier in 2011 <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L. Ali Khan</a>, Professor of Law at Washburn University wrote that the people's revolutions of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt are in <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">response to sham democracies</a> [JURIST op-ed] and their peoples' desire to enforce their rights and liberties. Also that year <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=11787855&Itemid=326/">Dr. Jonathan Schanzer</a>, Vice President of Research at the <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php">Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a> [advocacy website] noted that for all his problems, Saleh had kept <a href="/hotline/2011/03/the-middle-east-protest-movements-each-with-a-story-all-with-uncertainty.php">Yemen stable</a> [JURIST op-ed] by placating its influential tribal patriarchs and paying them patronage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A UN spokesperson said that the ECCC still lacks $1.8 million to fund operations from September through the end of the year. Due to budget shortfalls and the poor health of many defendants, some of the trials may be discontinued before a verdict is reached. The ECCC is currently trying two top Khmer Rouge officials for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

<p>The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for the deaths of more than 1.7 million people from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979, but the tribunal has been plagued with budget shortfalls and accusations of corruption. Last week the ECCC's international prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/khmer-rouge-court-prosecutor-announces-resignation.php">announced his resignation</a> [JURIST report] from the tribunal. Two weeks ago <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-cambodia-government-obstructing-khmer-rouge-court.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the refusal by the government of Cambodia to pay Cambodian staff at the ECCC was an attempt to undermine efforts to bring former Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. Approximately 100 tribunal staff members went on strike earlier that week to protest the unpaid wages, while UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-needs-funding.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] donors to provide financial support to keep the tribunal running. Tribunal employees reported to HRW that they are also bitter due to <a href="/hotline/2011/12/nisha-valabhji-cambodian-interference.php">"government interference and corruption at the court"</a> [JURIST op-ed], which has been a cause of concern since the trials began. The ECCC was established in 2001 to investigate and try those responsible for the Cambodian genocide, which resulted in the deaths of approximately one-third of the Cambodian population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The opinion, written by US district court judge <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2896&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Claire Eagan</a> [official profile], said that security leaks regarding the <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/opinion-by-secret-court-calls-collection-of-phone-data-legal.html?_r=0">jeopardized national security</a> [NYT report]. Eagan also emphasized that the political branches of government, rather than the courts, should make decisions about whether to keep or discontinue the surveillance programs:<blockquote>This court is mindful that this matter comes before it at a time when unprecedented disclosures have been made about this and other highly sensitive programs designed to obtain foreign intelligence information and carry out counterterrorism investigations. In the wake of these disclosures, whether and to what extent the government seeks to continue the program discussed in this memorandum opinion is a matter for the political branches to decide.</blockquote>Eagan's decision was the first written court opinion to be released since the program came to light earlier this year.

<p>The revelations surrounding NSA surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this week the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers. Last month the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. In June the ACLU in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php">NSA surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged, <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">raise significant First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee, which is made up of independent human rights experts, noted that Syria is a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is there for obligated to take the necessary measures to protect those with disabilities. However, during times of conflict, those with disabilities are often overlooked, which can lead to even greater rights abuses and hardship. The CRPD highlighted the increased stress on those with disabilities in a refugee context, noting that Syria owes a humanitarian obligation to these individuals who are increasingly the victims of neglect or abuse because of their disabilities. According to the committee, "As the humanitarian emergency response increases in the region, it is essential that there are inclusive protection and assistance programmes for all in order to guarantee access to human rights and minimum standards of treatment."

<p>The Syrian Civil War has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad. Earlier this week a group of UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-expert-calls-for-halt-of-supply-of-conventional-weapons-to-syria.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for an end to supplying Syria with conventional weapons. Last week UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-praises-syria-for-signing-chemical-weapons-ban.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government's formal agreement to sign and abide by the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=6357">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [text, PDF; OPCW <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">backgrounder</a>]. CWC signatories must agree to "chemically disarm" by destroying chemical weapon stockpiles and creating enforcement mechanisms to ensure that chemical weapons will not be produced, acquired or transferred within their jurisdiction. Rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government of responsibility for August 21 chemical weapon attacks, which allegedly involved the use of sarin nerve gas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, they <a href="http://www.kxan.com/news/texas-lege/hispanic-group-naacp-join-texas-voter-id-lawsuit">claim</a> [AP report] violates Section 2 of the <a href="http://www.ambrosevideo.com/resources/documents/147.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text, PDF], as well as the voting guarantees of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth Amendments</a> [text]. The groups are joining the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] in their challenge to the law. They claim that the requirement of a photo ID to vote is discriminatory against poor minorities and those in rural areas. The law's supporters claim that, since the ID's are available for free, it does not impose a sufficient barrier to voting to render the law unconstitutional. 

<p>The controversial SB 14 <a href="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/advisory2011-10.shtml">passed</a> [press release] the <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/">Texas Legislature</a> [official website] in 2011 and has remained a contentious <a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] issue ever since. In August the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-files-complaint-against-texas-over-voter-id-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] their petition against the law. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-calls-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">rejected the Texas law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after it came into effect in April 2012, noting that SB 14 would have a disproportionate impact on the state's Latino voters, and that the law is potentially discriminatory. The charge came only a month after Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/doj-objects-to-texas-voter-id-law.php">sent a letter on behalf of the DOJ</a> [JURIST report] claiming that the law violated Section 5 of the VRA. In December, a three-judge panel in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-gives-texas-permission-to-appeal-voter-id-law-ruling.php">granted permission</a> [JURIST report] to Texas officials to immediately appeal its August <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/jurist-the-us-district-court.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] rejecting a SB 14, which stated that the retrogressive effect within the law necessarily invalidated it under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Kathryn Nelson reasoned that local law enforcement officers do not have the authority to enforce federal immigration laws even if they have probable cause to detain individuals for a violation of law. This is especially true when the detention was solely for the purpose of questioning immigration status. The <a href="http://www.nwirp.org/">Northwest Immigrant Rights Project</a> (NWIRP) and the <a href="http://www.aclu-wa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Washington State</a> (ACLUWA) [advocacy websites] praised the recent decision as it clarifies that law enforcement officers cannot prolong a detention to question individuals about their immigration status. The decision stems from a case filed by NWIRP and ACLUWA on behalf of four Latino immigrants who were pulled over by Kitsap County sheriff's deputies for a broken headlight and suspicion of illegal shellfish harvesting. Although the plaintiffs were able to show proper identification for commercial shellfish harvesting, they were detained for further questioning of their immigration status. They were ultimately transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma.

<p>US Immigrant detention systems have been criticized in the past. In May the ACLU of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/aclu-criticizes-georgia-immigration-detention-centers.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">undocumented immigrants</a> [JURIST backgrounder] face constitutional and human rights violations in Georgia detention centers. In September 2011 the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that immigrants who are imprisoned while fighting deportation <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/third-circuit-rules-prolonged-detention-of-immigrants-unconstitutional.php">cannot be held indefinitely</a> [JURIST report] without a bail hearing and that the government must justify the need for the prolonged detention. In March 2011 the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">detailing investigations into immigrant detention centers</a> [JURIST report]. The report expressed concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by ICE. It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. The IACHR also found the average 30-day detentions troubling, arguing that it is likely to increase as backlogs of immigration cases increase. The number of immigration cases pending is expected to rise in light of the numerous state laws that have been enacted to address the issue of immigration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After voting to adopt the amendments on Monday, HRW called the changes "largely cosmetic," <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/17/hungary-constitutional-change-falls-short">accusing</a> [press release] the Hungarian government of not taking human rights and rule of law problems seriously. The advocacy group centered their concern around issues dealing with religious discrimination, a lack of judicial independence and the role of the government in the oversight of political campaign advertising. 

<p>Hungary had been <a href="/forum/2013/04/gabor-halmai-hungary-churches.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the previous changes to its constitution.

PASPA makes sports betting illegal nationwide except in Nevada, Oregon, Delaware and Montana. In the 2-1 holding, the Third Circuit reasoned that New Jersey's argument would compel the circuit to take "extraordinary steps" that include invalidating a law under the anticommandeering principle, disregarding the Supremeacy Clause in case of state activity contradicting federal laws and making it more difficult for Congress to enact laws under the Commerce Clause. New Jersey argued that by enacting PASPA, the Congress "impermissibly commandeers the states" and that PASPA was beyond Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. However, the court held that state-licensed wagering on sports, activity PASPA addresses, is an economic activity that affects interstate commerce. Thus, Congress has, under the Commerce Clause, the power to regulate activity that is "quintessentially economic." The court also noted that PASPA is not against the anticommandeering principle because Congress, by passing PASPA, "is not telling the states what to do, it is barring them from doing something they want to do." The dissenting judge noted that PASPA does not directly regulate interstate commerce or activities substantially affecting such. Rather, it directs states to prohibit from authorizing sports gambling, an otherwise unregulated activity.

<p>The recent decision affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-court-upholds-law-prohibiting-sports-betting-in-most-states.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of Judge Michael Shipp for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] who ruled that PASPA is constitutional, even though it is extremely unpopular in the state. Shipp rejected New Jersey's arguments that PASPA violates constitutional guarantees of state sovereignty and equal protection, saying that if New Jersey citizens disagree with the act, they should seek to have Congress repeal it rather than fight it in the courts. In October JURIST guest columnist Kathryn Young <a href="/dateline/2012/10/kathryn-young-nj-gambling.php">defended New Jersey's sports betting law</a> [JURIST op-ed], arguing that gambling can effectively increase states' revenue and should be viewed outside of its negative connotations. There is a presumptive prohibition on most forms of gambling in the US, although restrictions on some forms of Internet gambling were loosened late in 2011 when the Department of Justice (DOJ) clarified that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/doj-finds-online-non-sports-gambling-lawful.php">non-sports online gambling is presumptively legal</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2012 <a href="http://theppa.org/about/board/patrick-fleming/">Patrick Fleming</a> [advocacy profile], Litigation Support Director at <a href="http://theppa.org/">Poker Players Alliance</a> [advocacy website], argued that the decision bolstered the <a href="/hotline/2012/01/patrick-fleming-online-gambling.php">legitimacy of Internet betting</a> [JURIST op-ed], yet the gambling landscape remains a patchwork of many distinct standards and statutory definitions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Robert Ballou, presiding over the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website], found <a href="http://www.timescolonist.com/former-bosnia-prison-camp-guard-to-be-extradited-from-us-to-face-war-crimes-charges-1.627465">sufficient evidence</a> [AP report] in support of the allegations again Nezirovic, only needing final approval from <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">US Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] in order to complete the extradition process. Nezirovic is accused of beating, humiliating and traumatizing unarmed civilian prisoners while serving as a prison guard in his hometown of Derventa during the early stages of the Bosnian War. According to the police report, Nezirovic took part in mass unlawful arrests and detention of persons of Serb ethnicity during a four to six month period in 1992. 

<p>International and national efforts to convict war criminals have been ongoing. In August a Bosnian police chief was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/bosnia-police-chief-sentenced-to-14-years-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 14 years by the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] for crimes against humanity. In July the appeals chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-judges-reinstate-genocide-charges-against-karadzic.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] the acquittal of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY case summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] for a genocide charge during the Bosnian War. The decision reversed Karadzic's <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icty-upholds-ten-charges-against-karadzic-dismisses-one.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] last year on one of the charges he faces. In June New York resident Sulejman Mujagic was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/new-york-man-extradited-to-bosnia-and-herzegovina-to-face-war-crime-charges.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to his native country of Bosnia and Herzegovina for war crimes. He was fighting for the Army of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia when he and his men allegedly killed an enemy combatant with an AK-47, as well as kicked and beat enemy combatants with rifle stocks. In May the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icty-acquits-2-former-serbian-parliamentary-commanders-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">acquitted two former Serbian secret police officials</a> of charges of war crimes and also <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icty-convicts-6-bosnian-croat-leaders-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] six Bosnian Croat political and military leaders for persecuting, expelling and murdering Muslims during the Bosnian War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Five former appointees for the sheriff's office in Hampton, Virginia, sued the sheriff for choosing not to reappoint them after they used the button to support his opponent's campaign in 2009. The court held that such a public expression did not interfere with their duties as public servants and was essentially the equivalent of posting a campaign sign in their front yard, a long-standing protected form of speech. Referencing a plethora of circuit and Supreme Court cases, Chief Judge Traxler wrote:<blockquote>[T]he First Amendment generally bars the firing of public employees "solely for the reason that they were not affiliated with a particular political party or candidate" ... as such firings can impose restraints "on freedoms of belief and association." ... "[T]he question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation [or political allegiance] is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved."</blockquote>The court held that such a requirement was not necessary for the completion of the duties for which the plaintiffs were appointed. However, the majority held that the sheriff is protected by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in this case. The sheriff cannot be personally liable for any damages for a causal relationship between the lack of reappointment and free speech because authoritative law is not sufficiently clear as to whether political correspondence is necessary in general for the completion of sheriff duties.

<p>Free speech in the virtual world has become a hotly contested subject. In February, JURIST Guest Columnist Felix Treguer discussed the shifts in <a href="/hotline/2013/02/felix-treguer-twitter-france.php">virtual free speech in France</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Online speech has also become an issue during the Arab Spring, including the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a>, the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya Conflict</a> and the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST features], where individuals used social media to arrange large scale civil disobedience and document violent encounters with authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Shira Scheindlin initially <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the methods used by the NYPD were a violation of the Fourth Amendment, among others, and ordered them ceased until a final judgment on the matter was issued. The city appealed the matter and requested injunctive relief on the order. That request was denied when the court held:<blockquote>Contrary to statements by certain high-level city officials and pundits, this Court did not order an end to the practice of stop and frisk. Rather, this Court ordered that such activity be conducted in accordance with well-established controlling law. ... In short, the only activity at this stage is discussion between the Monitor, the Facilitator, and the parties to develop the remedies described above. No other specific relief is imminent, much less ordered.</blockquote>The court emphasized that no further steps or appeals can be taken while the case rests in an interlocutory phase and settlements are negotiated.

The legislation at issue, Local Law 71 of 2013, is a bill that expands the definition of racial profiling and gives New Yorkers who believe they were targeted the right to sue police in state court. In July of last year a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the NYPD used excessive force and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. In May of last year, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sotoudeh was serving six-year sentence for her September 2010 arrest and conviction for propaganda and harming national security. Other prisoners serving prison terms related to the 2009 mass protests were also <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/uk-iran-sotoudeh-idUKBRE98H0YC20130918">released</a> [Reuters report] on Wednesday. Among the released prisoners was former Iranian deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iran-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-six.php">sentenced to six years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for his participation in protesting the 2009 presidential election. It is estimated that the total number of prisoners released is around 10. 

<p>Sotoudeh is most widely known for representing political activists following the controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] and has worked on several high-profile cases. Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-human-rights-lawyer-temporarily-released-from-prison.php">temporarily released</a> [JURIST report] from prison earlier this year. Sotoudeh had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/17/lawyer-nasrin-sotoudeh-freed">angered authorities</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] by representing political activists and highlighting the execution of juveniles in the country. In December Sotoudeh ended a 49-day <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/iran-human-rights-lawyer-ends-hunger-strike.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in protest of her prison conditions and a travel ban imposed on her family. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] had expressed concern for Sotoudeh's deteriorating health and urged the Iranian government to lift the travel ban, saying the ban was not justified by international law. After judicial authorities agreed to lift the travel ban on Sotoudeh's daughter, Sotoudeh ended her strike. Sotoudeh was sentenced in January 2011 to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontairpollution.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/09/18/12-15131.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that California's <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2009/lcfs09/lcfscombofinal.pdf">Low Carbon Fuel Standard</a> [text, PDF] does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. The regulation requires reduction of carbon emissions for fuels. Emissions are measured by a "lifecycle analysis," which includes production and transportation. Thus, out-of-state manufacturers argued that they are discriminated against because they have to transport their fuels farther than their California counterparts. However, the court held that the regulation adopted by the state's <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">Air Resources Board</a> (ARB) [official website] does not facially discriminate against out-of-state companies. The court also noted that although the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [official website; EPA <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/laws-regulations">backgrounder</a>] expressly prohibits state regulation of emissions from motor vehicles, California has been allowed to adopt its own standards if it "determine[d] that the State standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards." Moreover, the court stressed that Congress has been recognizing California as the "laboratory" for innovation in terms of adopting and enforcing motor vehicle emission standards that are more advanced than the federal program. Thus, the court determined that California should be encouraged to find workable solutions in reducing or slowing carbon emissions which may prevent great harm to the public. The dissenting judge stated that the regulation in fact discriminates against out-of-state manufacturers, given that discrimination simply means different treatment. The judge added that the purpose or justification of the regulation has no impact on the determination of whether it is facially discriminatory. According to the dissent, California failed to demonstrate that it could not reduce carbon emissions in a non-discriminatory manner. With the recent ruling, the Ninth Circuit reversed a prior ruling by the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] that held the regulation to be in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.

<p>The rising emission of greenhouse gases has not been a new problem. In June 2012 the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-epa-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the findings of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] that heat-trapping pollutants such as carbon dioxide are endangering the public health and welfare. The findings at issue laid out the foundations for EPA's new restriction of greenhouse gas emissions placed on car models build in 2012 and on new regulations on permits for power plants and factories. The EPA has been <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] authority under the CAA to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, by automobiles. In <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1120/">Massachusetts v. EPA</a> [OYEZ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/supreme-court-to-consider-whether-epa.php">report</a>], 12 states and several environmental groups sued the EPA arguing that the agency had "abdicated its responsibility under the Clean Air Act" to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The court held that greenhouse gas was within the CAA's definition of "air pollutant" and thus, the EPA had statutory authority to take control the emission of such gases from new motor vehicles. In December 2010 the ARB <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/california-regulators-approve-incentives-for-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions.php">approved measures</a> [JURIST report] that will provide incentives to companies and factories that decrease their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/brazil-high-court-sentences-ex-presidential-aid-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] after it was discovered that, as top aides to former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, they had paid off legislators to support the ruling Workers Party Initiatives in Congress. The court found that new trials were warranted for criminal counts which received at least four not-guilty votes, entitling 12 of the 25 defendants to a new trial regarding their money laundering convictions. Because most of these 12 defendants were convicted on other counts, a new trial could only lessen their sentences and make them eligible for parole earlier. The court's decision has outraged many who viewed the earlier convictions as an end to impunity and now want to see a quick end to the case. <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verConteudo.php?sigla=portalStfSobreCorte_en_us&idConteudo=120056">Justice Celso de Mello</a> [official profile] said that the high court must remain a place for the protection of fundamental freedoms, despite the public outcry. 

<p>Government corruption continues to be a global problem. On Monday the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph">Philippine Justice Department</a> [official website] filed graft charges against nearly 40 current and former government officials and a prominent businesswoman for allegedly misappropriating millions of dollars in governments funds intended for the poor. Earlier in September Spanish lawmakers passed amendments to Spain's freedom of information law that aim to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/spain-passes-transparency-law.php">combat political corruption</a> [JURIST report]. The amendments, which increase accountability for the use of public funds, include political parties, the royal family, lobbies, unions and employers' associations. Also in September a lawmaker within Myanmar's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/myanmar-proposes-law-to-scrutinize-judicial-proceedings.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the legislative body intends to draft a bill that forms groups to monitor corruption in court proceedings. During the same timeframe the Chinese Ministry of Supervision began <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/china-asset-regulator-under-investigation-for-corruption.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Jiang Jiemin, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The investigation stems from Jiemin's alleged involvement in an undisclosed "serious discipline violation." Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-liberia-police-corruption-poses-serious-threat-to-justice.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in August that widespread police corruption in Liberia is denying Liberians equal and impartial justice and impeding the country's postwar development.<br />

The guidance states that the terms "spouse" and "marriage" in Title I of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-18">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974</a> (ERISA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] should be read to include same-sex couples who were legally married in any US state or jurisdiction that recognizes same-sex marriages. This will apply even where the same-sex spouses are now domiciled in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriages and will allow all such couples to participate in private employee benefit plans, such as healthcare and retirement plans. <a href="http://www.dol.gov/_sec/">Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/ebsa/EBSA20131720.htm">stated</a> [press release], "This decision represents a historic step toward equality for all American families, and I have directed the department's agency heads to ensure that they are implementing the decision in a way that provides maximum protection for workers and their families." Perez also said that the DOL will issue further guidance in upcoming months while the department works with other federal agencies to implement these new changes.

<p>Wednesday's guidance is in response to the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>], which overturned Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Earlier this month the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/doj-will-not-enforce-law-denying-veterans-benefits-to-same-sex-spouses.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will no longer enforce a federal law that denies same-sex spouses veterans benefits. In August the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> [official website] announced that it, along with the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website], will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">recognize marriages</a> [JURIST report] of all same-sex couples for federal tax purposes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report describes human rights violations, such as pillage, rape and torture, that are being committed by the <a href="http://worldwideconflicts.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/profile-seleka-coalition/">Seleka rebel coalition</a> [WorldWideConflict profile], the group that ousted former president Francois Bozize in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150040">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Central+African+Republic">news archive</a>]. These violations, according to the report, have been occurring since March and have resulted in the total destruction of more than 1,000 homes and the deaths of civilians from hunger and injuries. The report also describes how a number of civilians have fled their homes in fear of further attacks by the rebel group and are now living in the bush. Africa director at HRW, Daniel Bekele, stated that the Seleka have failed to deliver their promise of a new beginning for the CAR, and further, that they have recruited children as young as 13 years old to assist in the destruction. In addition to calling on the CAR to restore law and order, HRW urged the UN to investigate reports of abuses and destruction and to hold accountable the rebel groups.

<p>A number of international human rights groups have recently expressed concern regarding the ongoing situation in the CAR. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) stated that <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-refugee-agency-concerned-about-situation-in-central-african-republic.php">it is increasingly worried</a> [JURIST report] for the safety of civilians in the CAR. In August chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Fatou Bensouda, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/icc-prosecutor-voices-concern-over-situation-in-central-african-republic.php">expressed her concern</a> [JURIST report] over the deteriorating security situation in the CAR. Earlier that month a panel of UN human rights experts also <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-situation-in-central-african-republic.php">expressed their concern</a> [JURIST report] over the situation in the CAR. Also in August the UN Assistant Secetary-General for Human Rights held a press conference where he <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-warns-international-community-on-central-african-republic.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to remember the fragile state of the CAR. In May HRW initially reported that members of the Seleka rebel coalition have <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-centrial-african-republic-rebels-have-committed-rights-violations.php">committed rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arizona, a litigant in the lawsuit challenging the original ban, the expansion would <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ff-arizona-immigrants-20130919,0,4638232.story">also deny licenses</a> [LAT report] to immigrants who have been granted permission to stay in the US for humanitarian reasons, such as victims of domestic violence, human trafficking and sexual exploitation.

The complaint alleges that Brewer's order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution by interfering with federal immigration policy. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ninth-circuit-rejects-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's immigration law requiring law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A three-judge panel <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/19/tom-delay-conviction-overturned-by-texas-court/">voted 2-1</a> [WP report] to overturn the conviction, holding that the evidence presented by the state, stemming from a series of political transactions during the 2002 election cycle, was legally insufficient. According to the majority opinion, "The State did not prove the funds were 'illegal at the start of the transaction' or 'procured by illegal means originally.'" DeLay was acquitted of both money laundering and conspiracy charges. 

<p>In January 2011 a judge for the <a href="http://www.co.travis.tx.us/courts/criminal/district/331.asp">331st Criminal District Court</a> [official website] of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/delay-receives-three-year-sentence-for-money-laundering-and-conspiracy.php">sentenced</a> DeLay to three years in prison and 10 years of probation following his <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/texas-jury-convicts-delay-of-money-laundering-and-conspiracy.php">November 2010 conviction</a> [JURIST reports]. In August 2010 DeLay's lawyer confirmed that a US Department of Justice (DOJ) criminal probe into DeLay's association with lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive] had been dismissed <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/doj-ends-delay-criminal-probe-without-filing-charges.php">without charges being filed</a> [JURIST report]. The investigation lasted six years and included grand jury testimony from former aides as well as a review of more than 1,000 documents and e-mails from DeLay's office. In August 2008 a Texas appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-appellate-court-refuses-to.php">allowed the money laundering indictment</a> [JURIST report] against DeLay's associates to stand. In 2007 a Texas appeals court ruled against reinstating a charge of conspiracy to violate the state's election law against DeLay and his two associates. After he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/breaking-news-delay-indicted-for-money.php">indicted</a>, DeLay <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/delay-steps-down-as-house-majority.php">stepped down</a> as House majority leader and later <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/delay-to-resign-from-congress-as-legal.php">resigned from Congress</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Halliburton manager Anthony Badalamenti was also formally charged Thursday with one criminal count of tampering with evidence. US District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo of the US District Court for the Eastern District Court of Louisiana accepted the plea, and imposed the statutory maximum sentence of $200,000. The company has also been placed on probation for a period of three years. <a href="http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/default.page">Halliburton issued a press release</a> [text] citing the DOJ's characterization of its cooperation as "exceptional," and reiterating its commitment to operating with safety and integrity. Halliburton had announced its <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/halliburton-to-plead-guilty-to-destroying-evidence-in-2010-gulf-oil-spill.php">intention to plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July of this year.

<p>The oil spill took 11 lives and flooded the coast line with as much as 4.9 million barrels of oil. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between <a href="http://www.bp.com/">BP</a> [corporate website] and the DOJ for the company's criminal liability in the spill.

The individuals are among 29 activists, referred to as the Glen View 29, who have been imprisoned in connection with the murder since May 2011. High Court Judge Chinembiri Bhunu <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/19/zimbabwe-court-frees-21-opposition-activists/">found</a> [AFP report] that there was no evidence implicating any of these 21 activists, but that seven others will still have to stand trial. The twenty-ninth member of the Glen View 29 died recently, having become seriously ill after two years of imprisonment. The MDC <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=573328146048184">made a statement on its Facebook page</a> [text] reiterating its position that the party members who had been imprisoned were innocent and condemning the practice of imprisoning citizens without a trial. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged Zimbabwe to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/zimbabwe-must-review-police-misconduct-after-21-activists-cleared-murder-case-2013-09-19">review police misconduct</a> [press release] that took place in the aftermath of the murder.   

<p>Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Last month three UN independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Zimbabwe to respect international human rights including privacy and freedom of association, in light of growing hostility toward civil society organizations. In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues." In January <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to ensure "credible, free and fair elections."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legal question about the provision was not discussed before the court when it upheld the Act in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">June 2012 ruling</a> [JURIST report]. The petition asserts that the court of appeals' <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Hobby Lobby is incorrect and would "transform [the] <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.2043:">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text] from a shield for individuals and religious institutions into a sword used to deny employees of for-profit commercial enterprises the benefits and protections of generally applicable laws." The court is likely to take up the issue, as the appeals courts have split in their decisions on the legality of the rule.

<p>In September the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/09.17.13_opinion_affirming_denial_of_pi.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.autocam.com/home/index.php">Autocam Corp.</a> [corporate website] must comply with the Affordable Care Act's contraception coverage mandate. In July the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that family-owned, profit-making businesses cannot challenge the new federal health care law's birth control mandate on religious grounds. In June the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com/home.cfm">Hobby Lobby</a> [corporate website] may challenge the mandate to provide employees with coverage for contraceptives under the PPACA. In February the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/obama-administration-loosens-regulations-allowing-religious-nonprofits-to-opt-out-of-birth-control-c.php">issued a new rule</a> [JURIST report], which details a broader exemption to the contraception mandate, allowing for religious nonprofits that object to providing health insurance coverage for birth control to opt out of the requirement. In 2012 the US Supreme Court decision upholding the PPACA centered on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text] of the act, which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a fee equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under <a href="http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cha_chapter44_rule161_sectionc">international law</a> [text], individuals accused of human rights abuses may be investigated and tried elsewhere if the country in which the violations occurred does not do so. Citing to international law and the doctrine of universal jurisdiction, Argentine federal judge Maria Romilda Servini de Cubria ordered the arrest of four former officials who currently live in Spain and demanded their extradition to Argentina. Under Argentine law, those crimes can be punished with eight to 25 years in prison. The Spanish government, however, adopted an <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-spain-to-abolish.php">amnesty law in 1977</a> [JURIST report] after Franco's death barring investigation and prosecution of such crimes. In her arrest order, Servini named former Spanish officials&#8212;Jesus Munecas Aguilar, Celso Galvan Abascal, Jose Ignacio Giralte Gonzalez and Antonio Gonzalez Pacheco. All four men are accused of torturing political prisoners.

<p>In September 2010 an appeals court in Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/argentina-appeals-court-re-opens-investigation-into-spanish-civil-war-crimes.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into crimes against humanity committed in Spain during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/argentina-citizens-seeking-judicial.php">brought to federal court in April 2010</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/forum/2010/06/argentina-jurisdiction-and-spanish-amnesty.php">op-ed</a>] by Argentinian relatives of Spanish citizens killed during the Franco regime. The Spanish Supreme Court charged National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon for abusing his power by <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">opening an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the war crimes with abuse of power based on his 2008 order requiring the exhumation of 19 mass graves in Spain. Garzon had claimed the indictment was politically-motivated, compromised judicial independence, and sought to impose a specific interpretation of the 1977 amnesty law. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-concerned-over-prosecution-of-spain-judge-garzon.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Garzon's trial, indicating that judges should not be criminally charged for investigations performed within the scope of their judicial duties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Commonly known as <a href="https://nfcausa.org/">"fusion centers"</a> [website], these government surveillance units were established by Congress after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in order to foster cooperation between different law enforcement agencies. SARs are submitted by police, often at the request of community members or security guards, and are then analyzed by the fusion centers for perceived threats to national security. Having obtained numerous SARs from two fusion centers in California, the ACLU alleges a trend of privacy violations reflecting racial and religious bias. Among these reports were complaints of an unfriendly Middle Eastern neighbor and a group of Asian males who were taking photographs of an architectural structure. The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] currently encourages fusion centers to examine all potentially terrorism-related activities, without limitation. The ACLU called the existing standard vague, and urged fusion centers to adopt a new, heightened standard that would examine only reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. 

<p>The revelations surrounding US surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this week the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/unleashed-and-unaccountable">released</a> [press release] a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/unleashed-and-unaccountable-fbi-report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] calling on the Obama administration and Congress to rein in the expanding power of the FBI. Last month the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. In June the ACLU in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit </a>[JURIST report] against the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the NSA <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php">surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with The Guardian that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged, raise significant <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.ph">First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Despite notice by then-commissioners, along with an outcry from many citizen groups, the government allowed the terms of all commissioners to lapse on Monday without replacement, essentially dismantling the NHRC. HRW argued that without proper leadership, the NHRC will become powerless and ineffective, leaving the victims of rights abuses without a voice. To remedy the situation, HRW suggests that the government should expeditiously appoint an independent body to nominate new commissioners.

<p>Nepal has been criticized numerous times for its alleged disregard for human rights. In October 2012 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/NP/OHCHR_Nepal_Conflict_Report2012.pdf">report</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">urging justice</a> for victims of international law violations that occurred during Nepal's civil war, a conflict that resulted in approximately <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">13,000 deaths</a> [JURIST reports] and 1,500 disappearances. The report cited unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and sexual assault as some of the major offenses to have occurred during that period. In April 2012 HRW and the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/nepal-urged-not-to-impose-blanket-amnesty.php">urged Nepal</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/23/nepal-reject-amnesty-serious-crimes">reject blanket amnesty</a> [press release] plans for international crimes committed during the country's civil war. In the same month, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">spoke </a>[JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.can.gov.np/en">Constituent Assembly of Nepal </a>[official website] about several human rights issues in the country, including a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_250.pdf">reluctance to prosecute war crimes</a> and <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/resources/Documents/English/statements/DHC/2011_04_19_NWC_roundtable_DHC_remarks_E.pdf">insufficient progress increasing women's rights</a> [texts, PDF]. On several previous occasions, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-nepal-peace.php">OHCHR</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hrw-nepal-must-vigorously-investigate.php">HRW</a> [JURIST reports] have both appealed to the government of Nepal to investigate human rights violations allegedly committed during the civil war. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a special cabinet meeting Friday the government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/20/us-ivorycoast-icc-idUSBRE98J0GF20130920">declined</a> [Reuters report] to transfer Simone Gbagbo to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], where she is wanted her alleged crimes. According to an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1344439.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [text, PDF] issued by the ICC, Simone Gbagbo is to be tried, "for her individual criminal responsibility as regards the crimes against humanity of murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhumane acts committed during the post-election crisis from 28 November 2010 onwards by the Ivorian Defence and Security Forces ("FDS")." Simone Gbagbo and her husband were arrested in April 2011 and have been held under house arrest since then. 

<p>In June judges at the ICC gave prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-postpones-proceedings-former-ivory-coast-president.php">until November 15</a> [JURIST report] to develop their evidence against Laurent Gbagbo. Laurent Gbagbo is the first former head of state to come before the court and is charged with crimes relating to the civil war that broke out when he refused to step down after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">2010 election</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April Laurent Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ivory-coast-ex-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">appeared before</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to determine whether the case against him will proceed to trial. Gbagbo's lawyers urged the court to rule that the ICC does not have jurisdiction, and that Laurent Gbagbo should be tried by the Ivory Coast authorities currently conducting their own investigation. Gbagbo has been accused of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">crimes against humanity</a> [ICC arrest warrant] including murder, rape and persecution. A 2012 report from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.48_Extract.pdf">National Commission of Inquiry</a> [official summary, PDF] found both pro-Gbagbo and pro-President Alassane Ouattara forces responsible for serious international crimes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the group, outdated legal frameworks have permitted government surveillance of digital communications that grossly intrudes on the right to privacy. HRW endorsed a set of <a href="https://en.necessaryandproportionate.org/text">International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance</a> [text] to guide countries on modernizing privacy protections. Senior Internet Researcher Cynthia Wong said:<blockquote>Without updates to national privacy regimes, we are quickly headed toward a world where privacy disappears the second we go online or make a phone call. As mobile and Internet adoption expands globally, every country should ensure people can use these technologies without fear of invasive and disproportionate intrusions into their private lives.</blockquote>Wong said that the shocking revelations of mass monitoring in the US and UK are emblematic of the issue. 

<p>Revelations surrounding US government surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In August the <em>Washington Post </em> released a 2012 <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/nsa-report-on-privacy-violations-in-the-first-quarter-of-2012/395/">internal audit</a> [materials] revealing that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> [official website] broke numerous privacy laws since 2008. Congress approved the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr6304enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr6304enr.pdf">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act</a> [text, PDF] in 2008, granting the NSA broad authority to conduct surveillance of Americans to protect against terrorism and other foreign threats. The documents, leaked to the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>Guardian</em> by <a href="/feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Edward+Snowden">news archive</a>], describe more than 2,500 instances of the NSA exceeding its legal authority by engaging in unauthorized surveillance of Americans&#8212;including confusing a US area code with an Egyptian area code and intercepting a significant amount of US citizen phone calls. In July civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-groups-urge-fisa-court-to-allow-google-microsoft-to-disclose-secret-information.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an amicus curiae brief in the <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [FJC backgrounder] supporting efforts by <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate websites] to publish data concerning how many times the government invoked federal law to request user information for national security purposes. Also in July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-allows-nsa-surveillance-suit-to-continue.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging the NSA illegally surveilled "millions of ordinary Americans" in the wake of 9/11 and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-challenges-nsa-surveillance-in-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court challenging the NSA's telephone record surveillance program. In June the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the NSA is collecting call data from Verizon customers under a top secret court order. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the release issued at the end of Ezeilo's official visit to the country she concluded that:<blockquote>The phenomenon of trafficking in persons in Italy is unfortunately expanding in scale and impact. Traffickers are demonstrating a growing capacity for violence, exploitation and abuse of their victims. The anti-trafficking measures initiated by the Government require continuing monitoring and evaluation if significant progress is to be made and the vicious cycle broken.</blockquote> The Special Rapporteur strongly recommended that the Italian government put in place laws consistent with EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/download.action;jsessionid=rkt0S86Y224T4p3t3f37Q5GnMp1K6q12bLLC76qL9xjvxVqrXM4j!444076514?nodePath=/Legislation+and+Case+Law/EU+Legislation/Directive+THB+L+101+15+april+2011.pdf&fileName=Directive+THB+L+101+15+april+2011.pdf&fileType=pdf">directive 36</a> [text, PDF] on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims. The expert expressed concern over the lack of unified national strategy to combat human trafficking and a lack of a comprehensive statistical system to map the phenomenon in the country. Ezeilo will present her findings and recommendations in a report to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in 2014.

<p>In June Ezeilo <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-expert-urges-morocco-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">urged</a> Morocco to adopt a victim-centered <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13485&LangID=E">approach</a> [press release] to combat human trafficking in the country. Also in June the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] and the government of Japan <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-un-reach-agreement-to-combat-drug-and-human-trafficking.php">came to an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to increase efforts to combat drug and human trafficking in Africa and Southeast Asia. In February the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">UN International Labor Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-greater-effort-to-end-forced-labor.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] urging greater efforts to end forced labor. The ILO estimates that 21 million people are subject to forced labor, which often includes human trafficking for labor exploitation.

Al-Bashir has continually ignored the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/Pages/icc02050109.aspx">charges against him</a> [case materials] and is still being protected by the Sudanese government. AI is calling for the international community to come together in cooperation with the ICC in order to bring al-Bashir to justice. Despite the warrants for his arrest, al-Bashir has reportedly applied for a US visa in order to attend the 68th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. 

<p>This is the latest development in the on-going attempt to arrest al-Bashir. The ICC has faced difficulties in enforcing its arrest warrant against al-Bashir, in part because of the lack of support by neighbor states. In July, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-urges-nigeria-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Nigeria to arrest al-Bashir while he was in their jurisdiction. In June 2012 former ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said that <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/reject-aid-for-countries-that-refuse-to-arrest-al-bashir-icc.php">economic of other aid should be refused</a> [JURIST report] to those countries that assist al-Bashir in evading the arrest warrant that was issued against him in 2010. The ICC reported <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">Kenya</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc931075.pdf">Chad</a> [decision, PDF] in August 2010 for failing to arrest al-Bashir when he visited those country. In July 2010 the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] al-Bashir with three counts of genocide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/Global_Corporate_Sustainability_Report2013.pdf">Global Corporate Sustainability Report 2013</a> [PDF] released by the UN <a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/">Global Compact</a> (UNGC) [official website] surveyed nearly 2,000 companies across 113 countries, and found that although companies are defining goals and setting policies in compliance with the compact, implementation of the policies is still lacking. In his opening remarks, Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sgsm15300.doc.htm">stated</a> [press release]: <blockquote>The sustainable journey that we all need to take is in everybody's best interest&#8212;even if it may sometimes demand short-term sacrifice. Nobody can benefit from catastrophic climate change or rampant unemployment and the social unrest that comes with it. Prosperous, stable societies and a healthy planet are the bedrock of political stability, economic growth and flourishing new markets.</blockquote> Ban concluded his remarks by calling on business leaders to be "architects of a better world" by responding to global challenges and making sustainability a core part of their business strategies.

<p>The UNGC, set up in 2000, is the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative, with goals of linking business engagement with global priorities such as combating poverty, mitigating climate change, empowering women and children, implementing ethical labor standards and fighting corruption. The UNGC incorporates the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs) [official website] adopted by the UN in 2000 into sustainable business practices by the end of 2015, when the MDGs will expire. In May a group of international non-governmental organizations <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ngos-urge-world-leaders-to-pursue-rights-based-development-agenda.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] urging world leaders to pursue a rights-based development agenda after the MDGs expire. In 2012, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) and the <a href="http://www.unep.org/">UN Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/human-rights-environmental-laws-necessary-for-sustainable-development-un-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that integrative human rights and environmental protection laws and policies should be implemented to achieve sustainable development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new budget year begins on October 1 and without legislation authorizing government spending, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-passes-gop-spending-plan-that-defunds-obamacare/2013/09/20/4019117c-21fe-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html">most federal operations will halt</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. In his weekly address to the nation, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/21/weekly-address-congress-must-act-now-pass-budget-and-raise-debt-ceiling">chastised</a> [press release] the attempt to repeal the PPACA. The funding bill now moves to the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a>, where revisions may take until September 29 before the bill can be returned to the House for final approval.

<p>The PPACA has been under fire since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> by Obama on March 23, 2010. Most recently, the Obama administration  <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-review-contraception-mandate.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to review the PPACA's "contraception mandate," which requires employers to provide insurance covering birth control. US Courts of Appeals have split on the topic: the Third Circuit has held that profit-making businesses <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">cannot challenge the mandate</a> [JURIST report] on religious grounds, but the Tenth Circuit has ruled that businesses <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">may challenge the mandate</a> on religious grounds. Earlier this month, JURIST Guest Columnist Nicholas Caselli <a href="/dateline/2013/09/nicholas-caselli-conestoga-aca.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that corporations should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on employees. In December, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com/">Hobby Lobby, Inc.'s</a> [corporate website] application for an injunction to prevent enforcement of the contraception mandate, ruling that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontushouse.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> on Friday approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:H.R.1526:">bill</a> [text] that would significantly increase the amount of logging in national forests. The bill's supporters <a href="http://www.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/30492090-75/bill-logging-timber-forests-jobs.html.csp">claim</a> [AP report] the measure would both create more jobs and help reduce wildfires in the Western US. The bill provides that the Secretary of Agriculture will establish Forest Reserve Revenue Areas where a regulated amount of logging can take place. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration">Obama Administration</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr1526r_20130918.pdf">stated</a> [policy statement; PDF] its opposition to the bill. The administration claims the bill "undermine[s] many important existing public land and environmental laws, rules, and processes." Since the Forest Reserve Revenue Areas cannot be revoked and create an unchanged statutory quota of logging revenue, there is no room for other considerations such as environmental analyses. The bill is not likely to pass in the Senate and will likely be vetoed by President Obama should it pass.

<p>Regulation of national forests continues to be debated. This has increased since wildfires in Western states escalate due, in part, to overcrowded forests. In October 2011, The <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/tenth-circuit-reinstates-prohibitions-on-construction-timber-removal-in-national-forests.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate the Roadless Rule, blocking road-building and commercial timber harvesting on expanses of roadless areas around the country, primarily the National Forests. That February, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-idaho-forest-management-plan.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Idaho's own roadless rule despite environmental group's objections. One year before, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-upholds-rule-limiting.php">granted summary judgment</a> [JURIST report] for the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a> (NFS) [official website], upholding an agreement limiting the amount of timber that can be harvested in Alaska's Tongass National Forest.The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in 2009 affirmed a district court ruling <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-prohibits-construction.php">reinstating the Roadless Rule</a> [JURIST report], a decision <a href="/hotline/2009/08/ninth-circuit-ruling-to-reinstate.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST op-ed] by JURIST Hotline contributor Mike Dubrasich, Executive Director of the <a href="http://westinstenv.org/">Western Institute for Study of the Environment</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bo was convicted for using his position in the Communist Party of China (CPC) to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-09/22/c_132740484.htm">accept bribes</a> [Xinhua report] in the form of property and money for himself and others from 1999 to 2012. The Jinan Intermediate People's Court stripped Bo of all political rights and seized his personal assets. Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/china-communist-party-leader-formally-charged-with-corruption.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] Bo in July. His case has been viewed as a challenge for China's new president Xi Jinping, who has faced pressure from within the CPC to punish Bo lightly and to avoid a public trial. 

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform its judicial system and combat corruption. In September the Chinese Ministry of Supervision <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/china-asset-regulator-under-investigation-for-corruption.php">announced plans to investigate</a> [JURIST report] Jiang Jiemin, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The investigation stemmed from Jiemin's alleged involvement in an undisclosed "serious discipline violation." In March the chief justice of China's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-chief-judge-urges-courts-to-continue-legal-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the country to continue to implement legal reform to combat corruption and foster social and economic growth. In December 2010 a former Chinese corruption official was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-official-executed.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] for accepting more than USD $4.7 million in bribes. In July of that same year, China <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] its top judicial official for accepting bribes, protecting criminal gangs and rape. In March 2010 a life sentence for former vice president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) for bribery and embezzlement was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month, SPC president called for increased efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in China's court system. In January 2010 the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">announced a set of new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an efforts to increase public confidence in the rule of law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A hostage situation at a Nariobi mall has left nearly 60 dead and 175 wounded. Gunmen from a Somali Islamist group <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57604047/kenya-westgate-mall-hostage-standoff-continues-59-dead-so-far-minister-says/">attacked</a> [AP report] the Westgate mall on Saturday, holding hundreds hostage while battling Kenyan security personnel for over 30 hours. Ruto's lawyers reportedly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/22/us-kenya-attack-icc-idUSBRE98L07X20130922">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that he is needed in Kenya to oversee security and to deal with the social and political repercussions of the attack. 

<p>Ruto is on trial for three counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly fomenting violence following the 2007 elections, leading to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and displacement of more than 600,000. Earlier this month Ruto <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-deputy-president-pleads-not-guilty-at-icc-trial.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges. Also this month, Kenya's National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw from the ICC</a> [JURIST report]. In June the ICC conditionally <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-grants-kenya-vps-request-to-skip-parts-of-upcoming-trial.php">granted Ruto's request</a> [JURIST report] to be excused from parts of his trial. Ruto is the first senior serving politician to appear in an international court. Kenyan <a href="http://www.uhuru.co.ke/">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [official website] is also charged with crimes against humanity, but his trial is not set to begin until November 12.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ministers and senior officials from 47 countries adopted a comprehensive <a href="http://www.unescapsdd.org/files/documents/APPC6_WP1ER3.pdf">Asian and Pacific Ministerial Declaration on Population and Development</a> [PDF], which affirms and endorses policies of non-discrimination, of ending violence against women and of universal sexual and reproductive rights.

<p>The UN and others have been working around the world to promote gender equality and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive health</a> [JURIST backgrounder].

The Cairo administrative court declared that its ruling would apply to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24208933">all organizations affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC report], including its political arm, the <a href="http://www.fjponline.com/">Freedom and Justice Party</a> [party website]. Although the Muslim Brotherhood was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/23/egypt-bans-muslim-brotherhood-group/2853639/">banned for most of its 85-year existence</a> [AP report], it regained power when Islamist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST news archive] became president in 2012. It is unclear if the Muslim Brotherhood will appeal the ruling.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the military deposed president Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. Earlier this week JURIST guest columnist Liesel LeCates <a href="/dateline/2013/09/liesel-lecates-egypt-sentences.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] whether recent sentences by an Egyptian military tribunal against supporters of Morsi were fair. Last week Egyptian police <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-police-arrest-muslim-brotherhood-spokesperson.php">arrested a spokesperson</a> [JURIST report] for the Muslim Brotherhood. Two weeks ago the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-extends-state-of-emergency-for-two-months.php">extended emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] put in place in mid-August. Earlier in September an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-orders-closure-of-four-media-outlets.php">ordered the closure</a> [JURIST report] of four media outlets, including an affiliate of Al Jazeera, for their alleged support of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/09/03/egypt-court-bans-local-al-jazeera-station-over-accusations-that-it-is-pro-muslim-brotherhood/">reportedly claims</a> [AP report] that Al-Jazeera's affiliate provided biased news coverage during Brotherhood protests following the <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">removal</a> [JURIST report] of Morsi in July. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tolokonnikova <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/pussy-riot-hunger-strike-prison">wrote an open letter</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] detailing life inside the prison colony, stating that the prisoners work up to 17 hours a day and get four hours of sleep per night. She wrote that she complained to the deputy head of the prison and received a veiled threat against her life, but so far she has not encountered any physical violence because her international fame protects her. Tolokonnikova announced that she will continue the hunger strike until her concerns have been addressed. A representative of the Mordovia prison system denied all of Tolokonnikova's allegations.

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot has generated significant international attention. In August Pussy Riot member Yekaterina Samutsevich <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot-sues-former-defense-lawyer.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against her former defense lawyer, Violetta Volkova, for making and posting defamatory statements about her in the press and on social networking sites during the trial of other Pussy Riot members. A month prior, a regional court in Russia <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/russia-court-rejects-appeal-by-member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot.php">denied an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina. <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot-denied-parole.php">Alekhina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/member-of-russia-feminist-rock-group-denied-parole.php">Tolokonnikova</a> [JURIST reports] had their paroles denied in May. Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">released</a> last October. Alekhina, Samutsevic and Tolokonnikova, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison for "hooliganism" following the band's February 2012 performance of a protest song titled "Mother of God drive Putin away." The song was performed at a sacred Russian Orthodox Church, Christ the Savior Cathedral, in Moscow, and the court held that the performance was driven by religious hatred. The Pussy Riot case has generated much <a href="/dateline/2012/10/karlana-lewis-pussy-riot.php">criticism</a> and <a href="/dateline/2012/10/rebecca-buckwalterpoza-pussy-riot.php">debate</a> [JURIST op-eds] among scholars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the referendum does not explicitly target Muslims, it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hoKUtVzIRTzBXwx3CsqlLdXFB1wQ?docId=CNG.4832187725a643426db4444db90b9a16.981">drew outrage</a> [AFP report] from Muslim groups in Switzerland, who denounced the referendum as a blow to the constitutional rights of Muslim women. The referendum, which stipulates that "no one may require another person to cover their face for reasons of gender," was backed by the right-wing populist party <a href="http://www.ilguastafeste.ch/">Il Guastafeste</a> [party website, in Italian]. In a <a href="http://www.ilguastafeste.ch/votazione%20storica.html">press release</a> [text, in Italian], Il Guastafeste touted the referendum as a victory for western values against Islamic fundamentalism:<blockquote>The people have wanted to give a clear signal to the Islamic fundamentalists, very present in Ticino and Switzerland, telling them that in this country, those who want to integrate are well received regardless of their religion, but those who reject our values and aim to create a parallel society based on religious laws and designed to overlap with ours, are not welcome.</blockquote>The referendum passed with 65 percent of voters favoring it.

<p>Niqabs, burqas and other traditional Muslim garments have been a controversial subject, especially in Europe. Last week a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/uk-judge-rules-muslim-woman-must-remove-veil-to-give-evidence-at-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Muslim woman who is a defendant in an upcoming trial must remove her full-face veil when presenting evidence. Earlier that week a Quebec official <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/quebec-official-proposes-bill-banning-religious-headwear-for-public-workers.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] banning religious headwear for public workers. In February the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial/Tribunal_Supremo">Spanish Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/spain-supreme-court-strikes-down-city-burqa-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ban on wearing veils over the face in municipal buildings. Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banned</a> [JURIST report] burqas in July 2011. France's ban on burqas <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-burqa-ban-to-take-effect-april-11.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in April 2011. Some commentators have suggested that the rationales behind the European burqa bans are <a href="/forum/2012/02/maurits-berger-burqa-ban.php">weak</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the true purpose of the bills is societal discomfort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Saturday, a group of armed fighters stormed the Westgate shopping mall and at least <a href="https://www.kenyaredcross.org/PDF/PressReleases/Westgate%20Mall%20Sitrep%20update.pdf">62 people died and 175 were injured</a> [Kenya Red Cross fact sheet, PDF] in the attack.

Ban said, "[t]his premeditated act, targeting defenceless civilians, is totally reprehensible. The perpetrators must be brought to justice as soon as possible." The attack has also drawn criticism from the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], who condemned the attack and reiterated their responsibility under the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> [text] to combat terrorism. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI)  [advocacy website] has also <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/kenya-al-shabab-attack-despicable-affront-human-rights-2013-09-23">chastised</a> [press release] the group for the attack, stating that, "al-Shabab's blatant disregard for life in its attack on a Nairobi shopping centre on Saturday is a despicable affront to basic human rights." AI urged the Kenyan authorities to engage in a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation.

<p>The attack also affected the ongoing trial of Kenya <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Deputy President William Ruto</a> [ICC materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ruto">news archive</a>], who on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/lawyers-for-kenyas-deputy-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the International Criminal Court (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] postpone his trial so he can return to Kenya to deal with the attack. Ruto's lawyers reportedly claimed that he was needed in Kenya to oversee security and to deal with the social and political repercussions of the attack. Ruto is on trial for three counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly fomenting violence following the 2007 elections, leading to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and displacement of more than 600,000.

The injunction, signed by four of the seven-judge bench, calls for the election commission to <a href="http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/51345">delay the runoff election</a> [Haveeru report] until the court rules on the challenge filed by the <a href="http://www.jumhooreeparty.com/">Jumhooree Party</a> (JP) [party website, in Dhivehi]. The JP is seeking to annul the first round of elections held earlier this month for alleged discrepancies. This year's election is the second democratic presidential election in the country's history. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a> [JURIST news archive], the country's first democratically-elected president, resigned in 2012 after weeks of protests.

<p>The judiciary in the Maldives have faced recent criticism. In February the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers found that <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-maldives-judges-lawyer-facing-outside-pressure.php">lawyers and judges in the Maldives are not adequately independent</a> [JURIST report] from outside influence and called for a separation of powers between the parliament and court system. Earlier in February a Maldives court issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">second arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former president Nasheed on charges of the illegal detention of a judge. The charges against Nasheed stemmed from his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges last January, when Nasheed was still president. In September of last year Amnesty International revealed <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ai-urges-investigation-of-maldives-human-rights-violations.php">violent human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] committed in the Maldives against opposition groups and called for an immediate independent investigation into the actions of security forces. In July of last year a court in the Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maldives-court-refuses-to-hear-case-against-former-president.php">refused to hear a case</a> [JURIST report] about the legality of the arrest of the chief justice, saying it did not have jurisdiction. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkentucky.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for Kentucky's Jefferson County Circuit Court <a href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130924152731/marriage/images/6/65/Commonwealth_v._Clary_Order_2013-09-23.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] Monday that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are not protected by the husband-wife privilege under Kentucky's state law. Geneva Case, who will be compelled to testify, was married to the defendant, Bobbie Jo Clary, in Vermont. Case asked that the Kentucky court recognize the marriage that took place in Vermont, and, accordingly, apply spousal privilege. The judge denied Case's motion, citing the <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Statutes/statute.aspx?id=36466">Kentucky statute</a> [text, PDF] which says that a marriage between members of the same sex is null and void. Prosecutors claim that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/23/geneva-case-bobbie-jo-cla_n_3977547.html">Case heard Clary admit the killing</a> [AP report], and that she must testify to it. Clary maintains that she was acting in self-defense against a man who raped her. This is the first case addressing this issue in Kentucky.

<p>Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.kyequality.org/">Kentucky Equality Federation</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/lawsuit-challenges-kentucky-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to overturn Kentucky's <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Legresou/Constitu/233A.htm">amendment</a> [text] banning <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The debate over same-sex marriage is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Also this month an Ohio judge issued an order allowing a Cincinnati man to be <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">listed as "spouse"</a> [JURIST report] on the death certificate of his late husband. In August the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">US Treasury Department</a> announced that the Treasury, along with the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official websites] will now recognize the marriages of all same-sex couples for <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">federal tax purposes</a> [JURIST report]. Also in August a judge for the <a href="http://seconddistrictcourt.nmcourts.gov/">Second Judicial District Court of New Mexico</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-mexico-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] district court clerks to begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The week before, the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">consider whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts. In July the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-demanding-same-sex-marriage-in-pennsylvania.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Pennsylvania on behalf of 21 residents who wish to marry their same-sex partner or who are seeking recognition by the state of their out-of-state same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This announcement effectively <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/23/us-military-ending-gitmo-hunger-strike-updates/2857273/">declared the end</a> [AP report] of the unprecedentedly broad, six-month long, prisoner protest. There are now 164 prisoners in Guantanamo, and as many as 106 were on strike at the peak of the protest in July. Only 19 detainees are still classified as on hunger strike. For those 19 prisoners, force-feeding continues. The hunger strike has brought attention to the prison, and caused US President Barack Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-renews-pledge-to-close-guantanamo.php\">renew his pledge to close the facility</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>This is the most recent development surrounding Guantanamo Bay. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/judge-rules-us-government-does-not-have-to-release-investigation-videotapes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the US government does not have to release photographs and videotapes taken during the investigation of detainee Mohammed al-Qahtani's connection to the 9/11 attacks. Last month the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainees-to-algeria.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria. In July a US court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-guards-allowed-to-continue-detainee-genital-searches.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Guantanamo guards were allowed to continue detainee genital searches. In June a federal judge called on members of Congress and Obama to give serious consideration to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-urges-new-approach-in-handling-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">formulating a different approach</a> [JURIST report] for the handling of Guantanamo detainee cases. Just days prior Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo. In April JURIST guest columnist David Frakt <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST op-ed] to release those detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A panel of judges for the Court of Appeals of Bordeaux denied a motion brought by Sarkozy's lawyers to dismiss key medical testimony that determined Bettencourt has been suffering from dementia since 2006, before Sarkozy allegedly sought funds for his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation for "abuse of weakness" in March but denies any misconduct. Sarkozy's lawyers will have five days to appeal the decision to the <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French], France's highest appeals court.  

<p>Sarkozy is facing several other corruption allegations. In April French authorities opened a judicial investigation into <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/19/us-france-sarkozy-idUSBRE93I0GL20130419?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews">allegations that Sarkozy accepted illicit funds</a> [Reuters report] from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Last June a suit was filed against Sarkozy to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/france-ex-president-sarkozy-facing-legal-action.php">investigate his alleged involvement</a> [JURIST report] in the French sale of submarines to Pakistan in the 1990s. In December 2011 Sarkozy's predecessor, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12666433">Jacques Chirac</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chirac">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/france-ex-president-chirac-convicted-of-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by a French court on corruption charges, receiving a two-year suspended sentence. He was accused of using public funds to support his political goals when he was mayor of Paris. Three months earlier a French prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/france-prosecutor-seeks-acquittal-in-chirac-corruption-case.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the court to drop the corruption charges against Chirac. During the same month lawyers for Chirac <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/chirac-too-ill-to-attend-corruption-trial-lawyers.php">filed documents</a> with the 11th Criminal Court of Paris claiming that their client was to ill to attend court hearings that was planned to begin after it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/perchase/2011/03/france-ex-president-chirac-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.php">delayed</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The current crisis in the CAR has displaced more than 260,000 people, including 100,000 children. Beyani noted that a recent UN mission reported a series of recent attacks by unidentified armed groups, which were reported to have killed 30 people and forcibly displaced thousands. Beyani also remarked on the systematic destruction of public records, a loss which Beyani believes will have a particularly negative impact of IDPs whose personal documentation may be lost or destroyed when their communities are attacked. "The situation of all those displaced who hide in remote areas, including in the bush, in poor sanitary conditions and without access to basic services or clean services is extremely worrying," Beyani said. "The government should honour the country's obligations ... to ensure that IDPs are protected and supported until they reach durable solutions."

<p>Michel Djotodia declared himself the nation's leader in March after the <a href="http://worldwideconflicts.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/profile-seleka-coalition/">Seleka rebel alliance</a> [WorldWideConflicts backgrounder] seized the nation's capital and caused president <a href="http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-A-Ec/Bozize-Francois.html">Francois Bozize</a> [World Biography profile] to flee the country. Djotodia, a leader of Seleka, also <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/central-african-republic-rebels-dissolve-constitution.php">dissolved the constitution</a> [JURIST report], parliament and government. Also in March UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels and advocated for the "swift restoration of constitutional order."

The CAR has also recently been criticized for its controversial use of child soldiers.

Warg was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/sweden-court-convicts-founder-of-pirate-bay-website.php">originally sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison in June for hacking and fraud.

The plaintiffs in the case <a href="http://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/13/09/b3938890/california-superior-court-judge-rules-for-philip-morris-usa-in-lights-c">argued</a> [PM press release] that Philip Morris violated California's false advertising laws by using the terms "Lights" and "Lower Tar and Nicotine" on cigarette packages. In denying plaintiffs' claim for damages and injunctive relief, Judge Ronald Prager of the <a href="http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=55,1&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL">San Diego County Superior Court</a> [official website] found that the plaintiffs did not present any hard evidence to show that they were damaged by Philip Morris' labeling:<blockquote>Plaintiffs failed to present any specific evidence entitling them to injunctive relief. To the contrary, the evidence established that the descriptors on which the Plaintiffs base their case have been removed and, because of changes in the law, these descriptors can never be used again. Since there is little likelihood that the conduct giving rise to this case will reoccur, the claim for injunctive relief is moot.</blockquote>The ruling is the latest development in a 16-year-old class action suit.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cigarette+label">Cigarette labeling</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a controversial legal issue recently. In December the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-appeals-court-rejects-rehearing-request-on-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] for rehearing on a decision holding that the FDA's rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration's</a> (FDA) [official website] statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy. In March 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sixth-circuit-upholds-cigarette-warning-labels.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the graphic cigarette label warnings are constitutional. The court decided unanimously that the portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control</a> Act (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, including a ban on distributing clothing and goods with logos or brand names, as well as sponsorship of cultural, athletic and social events requiring cigarette packaging and advertisements, is a valid restriction of commercial speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint was filed on behalf of Aamer by the British human rights group, <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website]. The complaint notes that Aamer has been cleared for release by both the US and the UK but is still being held at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Aamer and his lawyers allege this delay is due to Aamer's treatment during his interrogation at the hands of UK security forces. Aamer was detained in Afghanistan for allegedly fighting at an al Qaeda stronghold, which Aamer denies, stating that he was performing charity work. He claims that the UK security forces gave the US false information about evidence they claim was revealed during this detention.

<p>This is the latest development in Aamer's detention. In July Aamer joined other detainees in asking a US federal judge to <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-prisoners-ask-federal-court-to-order-end-to-force-feedings.php">end their force feedings</a> [JURIST report] that came in response to detainee hunger strikes. Last December Aamer <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/guantanamo-detainee-launches-defamation-suit-against-uk-agencies.php">filed another lawsuit</a> [JURIST] against the British security forces calling for his release to be granted. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-chides-prolonged-detention-of-uk-man-in-guantanamo.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] Aamer's detention at Guantanamo, calling it a "mockery of justice." In November 2011 AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-calls-for-release-of-last-uk-guantanamo-detainee.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US and the UK to work towards the release of Aamer. AI UK Director Kate Allen called on Hague and US officials to give a specific timetable for Aamer's release. The Hague and the US have been in discussions over Aamer's release, but no formal indications of a release have been made. The UK agrees that if Aamer is released, they will be wiling to accept him, as they did with former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">Binyam Mohammed</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report determined that in 90 percent of all surveyed 143 economies, there was at least one legal difference adversely affecting women. Among the countries, Saudi Arabia was the leading country with more than than 25 legal differences but fewer than two incentives to encourage women to work. Areas in which legal differences existed included travel, ability to sign contracts, financial management and employment. World Bank Group President <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/president">Jim Yong Kim</a> [official profile] stated that providing equal opportunities is a "smart economic policy" because women can contribute to establish a "more cohesive society and a more resilient economy."

<p>Last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-urges-yemen-to-include-womens-rights-in-constitution.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the head of the Rights and Freedoms Working Group for Yemen's National Dialogue to incorporate protections for women in the country's new constitution. HRW listed seven key issues affecting women's rights&#8212;equality, non-discrimination, political parties, violence against women, personal status law, child marriage and nationality rights. In May the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=3543&language=en-US">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-urges-libya-to-include-women-in-drafting-constitution.php">participation</a> [JURIST report] of Libyan women in the Constitution Drafting Assembly. The UNSMIL noted that the preparation and drafting of the constitution is a significant part of Libya's democratic transition, and the representation and participation of women throughout the process will greatly contribute to the growth of the country. Also in May the <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) and <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-urges-afghanistan-to-approve-womens-rights-legislation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] Afghanistan's government to fully respect and defend the fundamental rights of women and girls by ensuring the implementation of and respect for women's rights legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling will allow the administration to argue for bringing oversight of Texas' voting law back under the court. This oversight was changed after the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Shelby_Cnty_v_Holder_133_S_Ct_2612_186_L_Ed_2d_651_2013_Court_Opi/2">Shelby County v. Holder</a> [text] in June. While Texas argued that the government's challenge was both untimely and moot, the court ruled 2-1 that the government should be allowed to join. Stating in the opinion:<blockquote>We have already concluded that the 2011 plan claims are not moot and that the parties can pursue relief under &#167; 3(c) with regard to the 2011 plan claims. ... Accordingly, Defendants' opposition to intervention on the basis of mootness lacks merit. ... The United States has a direct interest in the construction and application of &#167; 3(c) that was not present until after the Shelby County ruling. Therefore, the interest that the United States seeks to protect is not the same interest that was present from the inception of the litigation. ... [T]he United States timely moved to intervene to protect its interest in the litigation of &#167; 3(c) issues (and their effect on the application of &#167; 5 preclearance) once its interest became apparent.</blockquote>The court also noted that the government's interest could produce distinctive arguments from those currently put forward by the challengers. Because of this, the court stated, joining the government fully to this matter would not introduce any undue delay or prejudice.

<p>This is the latest development in one of two major challenges to Texas voting laws. The other significant challenge is to Texas' Voter ID law. The controversial <a href="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/advisory2011-10.shtml">SB 14 passed</a> [press release] the <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/">Texas Legislature</a> [official website] in 2011 and has remained a contentious <a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] issue ever since. In August the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-files-complaint-against-texas-over-voter-id-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] their petition against the law. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-calls-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">rejected the Texas law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after it came into effect in April 2012, noting that SB 14 would have a disproportionate impact on the state's Latino voters, and that the law is potentially discriminatory. The dispute around the voting map began to intensify with a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-court-rules-texas-voting-map-discriminatory.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the proposed 2011 maps were discriminatory in August 2012. Before that, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rejects-interim-texas-redistricting-maps.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] proposed interim redistricting maps in January 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition was filed on behalf of 10 Vieques residents who have cancer or have relatives suffering from cancer. Vieques was used as a military exercise range for the US Navy for 60 years until 2003, four years after a security guard was accidentally killed during a bombing practice. The NLG claimed that the hazards created during those years were never communicated to the island's citizens, who ultimately suffered chronic illness. Moreover, as a result of the Navy's military practices, the island became polluted with toxic residue adversely affecting the civilian population. Thus, the lawyers accused the US government of violating several articles of the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Basicos/English/Basic2.american%20Declaration.htm">American Declaration</a> [text]. If the Commission finds violations were committed, it will make a list of binding recommendations. The lawyer filing the petition <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/legal-groups-accuse-us-of-human-rights-abuses-in-vieques/2013/09/24/36c60d88-2540-11e3-9372-92606241ae9c_story.html">stated</a> [AP report] that the petition is not seeking specific reparations but is asking for changes that would mitigate the existing damages, such as improved health care and transportation to Puerto Rico.

<p>The US government has continuously rejected the claim that the US Navy's military practice in Vieques has caused any health or environmental problems. In May the <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/">Agency for Toxic Substances &#38; Disease Registry</a> (ATSDR), an agency for the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">US Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official websites] issued a <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/pha/vieques/Vieques_Summary_Final_Report_English_2013.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] concluding that the Navy activities in Vieques did not pose any health or environmental hazards. The agency <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/us-says-navy-bombings-on-vieques-pr-posed-no-health-risks.html?_r=0">reached</a> [NYT report] that same result two years earlier. The cleanup of the former military practice site is ongoing and is expected to last for another decade.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Timothy Black ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">July</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">September</a> [JURIST reports] that the surviving same-sex spouses of two decedents should be listed as spouses on death certificates because their marriages were valid under the laws of the states where they were performed. Those two orders limited the scope of precedent to those parties only, but Wednesday's decision granted a motion to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/apnewsbreak-ohio-gay-marriage-suit-expanded-seeks-recognition-for-similarly-situated-couples/2013/09/25/c6652ffa-25fe-11e3-9372-92606241ae9c_story.html">expand the precedent</a> [AP report] to all similarly situated couples. Attorneys are now asking the judge to direct his decision to mandate compliance by the Ohio Health Department's internal policies for death certificates. A decision is expected in December.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with courts splitting over whether to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. Earlier this week a Kentucky judge ruled that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">not protected by the spousal privilege</a> [JURIST report] under Kentucky state law. Last month the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">consider whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=jCGZWLzQqR0%3d&tabid=11243&mid=14383&language=en-US">report</a> [text, PDF, in French] attributed the recent <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=10662&ctl=Details&mid=14701&ItemID=20162&language=en-US">violence in the east</a> [press release] to state security forces, the guerrilla group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">news archive</a>] and other armed forces. Scott Campbell, director of the UN Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC, <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?ctl=Details&tabid=10662&mid=14594&ItemID=19794">commented</a> [official website], "[i]t is essential to establish reliable vetting mechanisms to ensure that human rights abusers are not maintained within or integrated into the security forces." The first proceedings against state abusers of human rights have yet to be established.

<p>The report comes on the heels of the UN's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-expert-calls-for-international-community-to-address-impunity-in-drc.php">call to diminish institutionalized impunity</a> [JURIST report] in the war-torn nation. Last month UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-calls-for-drc-to-respect-human-rights.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] the importance of respecting human rights in the DRC. In July <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that M23 is <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/hrw-drc-rebels-recieving-aid-from-rwanda-despite-abuses.php">receiving assistance from Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] despite continued human rights abuses, including rape, executions and forced recruitment of young boys. In May a UN report found that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">DRC troops committed rape and murder</a> [JURIST report] as they retreated from an advance by M23 rebels last November. In February HRW reported that during the siege of Goma,<a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">M23 forces summarily executed 24 individuals</a> [JURIST report], 21 of whom were civilians, and raped 36 women, including a 10-year-old girl.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsrilanka.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Sri Lanka must continue to work to improve its human rights record, according to an <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session24/Documents/A-HRC-24-CRP-3-Rev1_en.doc">oral report</a> [text, DOC] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] filed Wednesday with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website]. The report noted the large military presence in certain regions and lack of civil administration and economic activity, despite four years having passed since the end of the country's<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">26-year civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Although there are some improvements, such as the separation of the police from the Ministry of Defense, Pillay found areas requiring improvement. The High Commissioner gave the government until March 2014 to establish a "credible national process" by taking measures such as prosecuting those responsible for human rights violations. The report also noted that the country saw a surge of hate crimes against religious minorities, including Christians and Muslims. Pillay condemned the government's response of denying the issue or blaming the minorities for the surge. Moreover, Pillay "observed great disquiet" about the erosion of rule of law and democratic institutions, especially in light of the recent criminal <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sri-lanka-ex-chief-justice-charged-with-corruption.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against former chief justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bandaranayake">Shirani Bandaranayake</a> [JURIST news archive]. The impeachment of the justice endangered the independence of the judiciary, according to the report. The Sri Lankan government <a href="http://colombogazette.com/2013/09/25/lanka-rejects-pillays-report/">rejected the report</a> [<em>Colombo Gazette</em> report], stating that Pillay does not have the authority to call for an international investigation if the government fails to meet the March 2014 deadline.

<p>The oral update was another call by Pillay to Sri Lanka to improve its human rights record. In August Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-reprimands-sri-lanka-government.php">expressed particular concern</a> [JURIST report] with the curtailment and denial of personal freedoms and human rights, claiming these limitations threaten democracy and the rule of law in the country. The UN and other international human rights groups have urged Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes committed during its civil war with the LTTE. Also in August, at the beginning of her visit, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-visits-sri-lanka-to-investigate-war-crimes-allegations.php">pledged to raise concerns</a> [JURIST report] with the government's human rights record, particularly with regard to alleged war crimes against ethnic Tamils. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said that there has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-no-progress-in-sri-lanka-since-civil-war-ended.php">no progress</a> [JURIST report] regarding respect for basic rights and liberties in the four years since the end of the country's civil war. In March the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-body-adopts-resolution-on-sri-lanka.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. In February Sri Lankan authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">accused of using rape</a> [JURIST report] as a method of interrogating members or supporters of the LTTE. Earlier that same month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized Sri Lanka</a> for failing to investigate war crimes, and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-pushes-un-for-independent-investigation-of-sri-lanka-rights-abuses.php">pushed</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent investigation of rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website], while signing the treaty on behalf of the US government, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-un-assembly-kerry-treaty-idUSBRE98O0WV20130925">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the signature would affect US manufacturers and exports only minimally given the already strict export controls for weapons. The treaty still has to be presented to the Senate before it can be ratified. The <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] opposed the signing, arguing that it threatens American sovereignty and is an unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment. 

<p>In May JURIST Guest Columnist Clare da Silva of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2013/05/clare-da-silva-arms-trade.php">argued</a> [JURIST hotline] that the treaty showed remarkable progress in the international regulation of arms transactions. The treaty was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-general-assembly-approves-global-arms-trade-treaty.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] in April with 154 member states voting in favor and only three opposed. Twenty-three countries abstained from voting, including Russia and China. The treaty prohibits states from exporting conventional weapons to governments in violation of UN arms embargoes and from exporting conventional weapons which may be used in genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or terrorism. It also requires that states prevent conventional weapons from reaching the black market. The treaty does not control the use of domestic weapons. Restrictions on ammunition were considered, but the US struck down the idea. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-votes-to-negotiate-international-arms-treaty.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to re-enter negotiations over an international arms treaty in December. Previous negotiations had fallen apart, and many blamed the political climate in the US and the substantial pressure from the NRA to veto any international arms treaty. In July of last year the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/deadline-for-un-arms-treaty-passes-without-consensus.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the deadline for an arms treaty to pass without reaching a consensus. Earlier that month <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-treaty-to-regulate-international-arms-trade.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the UN member states to establish a comprehensive arms treaty to limit the flow of conventional arms to terrorists and criminal networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1nGfGDPkd8s%3d&tabid=235">press release</a> [text] from the court, Taylor's lawyers appealed his convictions on 42 grounds, arguing that the Trial Chamber erred in evaluating evidence and that the 50-year sentence was "manifestly unreasonable." The court ruled that his guilt had been proved beyond doubt and upheld Taylor's 50-year sentence. The sentence came after Trial Chamber II <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=EGbW%2bCH%2fwbE%3d&tabid=53">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF] Taylor of planning as well as aiding and abetting crimes committed by rebel forces in exchange for diamonds during the civil war, including acts of terrorism, murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting or enlisting children into armed forces, enslavement and pillage.

<p>The SCSL was created in a joint endeavor by the government of Sierra Leone and the UN to provide a forum to try those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law, committed in Sierra Leone. With Taylor's conviction, the SCSL has largely fulfilled its mission and will take steps to shut down. Steps have already been taken to facilitate this process. In November 2009, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">handed over its detention facility</a> [JURIST report] to the Sierra Leone Prison Service in a monumental step towards the court's resolution. The month before, eight men judged guilty of war crimes by the court were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-transfers.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Rwanda to serve out their terms. Although the court is winding down, it is still active. In early October, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences-four-for-contempt.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four men to prison terms ranging from 18 months to 2 years on contempt charges stemming from allegations of witness tampering. The month before, the court found three members of Sierra Leone's former Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-convicts-three-of-contempt.php">guilty of contempt</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The couples claim that the state's same-sex marriage ban violates both the state and federal constitutions, and the suit names as defendants <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_pa_gov/20650">Governor Tom Corbett</a>, <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/theoffice.aspx?id=6794">Attorney General Kathleen Kane</a> and <a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_of_health_information/10674/secretary_of_health/556772">Health Secretary Michael Wolf</a> [official websites]. Earlier this month Commonwealth Court Judge Dan Pellegrini <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/setting-3220/file-3027.pdf?cb=c0e67e">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] the <a href="http://www.montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid=202">Montgomery County Register of Wills</a> [official website] court clerk Bruce Hanes to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, finding that Hanes could not disregard the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/23/23.HTM">Pennsylvania Marriage Law</a> [text] simply because he believed it to be unconstitutional. Hanes began issuing licenses to same-sex couples after Kane said the law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> under the US Supreme Court holding in <a href="/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST reports]. 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with courts splitting over whether to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. On Wednesday a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-expands-ohio-same-sex-marriage-challenge-to-other-couples.php">expanded a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking the recognition of same-sex spouses on death certificates. Judge Timothy Black ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">July</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">September</a> [JURIST reports] that the surviving same-sex spouses of two decedents should be listed as spouses on death certificates because their marriages were valid under the laws of the states where they were performed. Earlier this week a Kentucky judge ruled that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">not protected by the spousal privilege</a> [JURIST report] under Kentucky state law. Last month the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it will consider <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The patent is <a href="http://india.nydailynews.com/business/a857f982585c68e6060f27a89cfd1de1/japan-fines-apple-for-patent-infringement">disputed</a> [IANS report] by Japanese inventor Norihiko Saito, whose company applied for the patent in 1998. Presiding Judge Teruhisa Takano stated that the 1998 patent covers the technology that Apple adopted for its iPod in Japan in 2004. The money damages awarded to Saito are significantly less than the <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/apple-ordered-to-pay-y330-million-over-patent-infringement-in-japan--kyodo-20130926-00181">$10 billion yen demanded</a> [Dow Jones report] in the initial complaint. 

<p>Apple has been embroiled in patent litigation in courts around the world. In June the <a href="http://www.ip.courts.go.jp/eng/index.html">Intellectual Property High Court in Tokyo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-appeals-court-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-suit.php">affirmed</a> a lower court's <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-suit.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] in favor of Samsung in their own patent dispute with Apple. Also in June the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-trade-commission-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">issued a limited import ban</a> [JURIST report] and a cease-and-desist-order against Apple for AT&#38;T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad 3G, and iPad 2 3G after finding the devices violated a patent held by Samsung Electronics. In March a UK court ruled in favor of Apple in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">involving three patents</a> [JURIST reports] in connection to data and information transfer technology that Samsung alleged Apple infringed. In February the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-apple-request-to-block-samsung-sales.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] by Apple to ban sales of Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone based on allegations of willful patent infringements. In January the <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6410">District Court of The Hague</a> [official website] ruled that the designs of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, 8.9 and 7.7 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/dutch-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">do not infringe</a> [JURIST reports] designs patented by Apple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the wake of revealing disclosures from the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=edward+snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive], Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), along with co-sponsors Mark Udall (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Rand Paul (R-KY), hopes to enact "real, and not just cosmetic, intelligence reform" after outrage from the American public and skepticism from the international community. The bill, which has not yet been released, would close the government's access to bulk collection of communication records, which is currently authorized under <a href="http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/act-section-215">Section 215 of the Patriot Act</a> [text], put in place an independent constitutional advocate to argue against the government in front of the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> [official website], and allow private companies to disclose a record of their participation with the NSA as well as challenge the constitutionality of the government's data collection. 

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LmV56zE3SK4?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The revelations surrounding NSA surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers despite the FISC's release of a previously classified opinion <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">justifying</a> [JURIST report] the need for the NSA's surveillance program. Last month the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. In June the ACLU in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php">NSA surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged, <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">raise significant First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

After Cara Palladino and Isabelle Barker were legally married in Massachusetts, they moved to Pennsylvania, which does not recognize same-sex marriage, even if the marriage was legally performed in another state. The couple claims that the state's <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/09/women_married_in_massachusetts.html">same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional</a> [AP report], and names <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_pa_gov/20650">Governor Tom Corbett</a> and <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/theoffice.aspx?id=6794">Attorney General Kathleen Kane</a> [official websites] as defendants. 

<p>This lawsuit comes only one day after <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/pennsylvania-same-sex-couples-ask-court-to-affirm-their-marriages.php">21 same-sex couples filed suit</a> [JURIST report] asking the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court/">Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court</a> [official website] to affirm the legality of their marriage licenses, which were <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/pennsylvania-judge-orders-to-stop-issuing-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">issued by a county clerk</a> [JURIST report] who believed the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Earlier this month Commonwealth Court Judge Dan Pellegrini ordered the <a href="http://www.montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid=202">Montgomery County Register of Wills</a> [official website] court clerk to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, finding that the clerk could not disregard the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/23/23.HTM">Pennsylvania Marriage Law</a> [text] simply because he believed it to be unconstitutional. Hanes began issuing licenses to same-sex couples after Kane said the law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> under the US Supreme Court holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST reports]. Thursday's lawsuit brings the tally up to at least four same-sex marriage suits that are now pending in the state of Pennsylvania. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The changes to the labor code were adopted last year and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303796404579098992136393268.html">allowed</a> [WSJ report] for private companies to fire employees that held positions deemed redundant or who were considered unable to adapt to changing job skills or requirements. The court found the labor code violated the nation's <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=179405">constitution</a> [text, PDF], specifically Article 53, which states: "Workers shall be guaranteed job security, and dismissal without fair cause or for political or ideological reasons shall be prohibited."  Portugal received a &#8364;78 billion (USD $105.5 billion) <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13408497">bailout</a> [BBC report] in 2011 from the EU and the International Monetary Fund, conditioned on the nation reworking its economic and labor system.

<p>Portugal is one of many European states struggling to recover from financial crisis of 2008. Last month the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/portugal-high-court-strikes-down-austerity-measure.php">struck down</a> [JURIST post] an austerity measure that would have made it easier for the government to lay off civil servants. The revised law applied to government employees deemed redundant and that had been unemployed for more than 12 months. In April the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/portugal-court-finds-provisions-of-2013-budget-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that four out of nine contested austerity measures of the 2013 state budget were unconstitutional. The court's decision came in response to the request of Portugal's President <a href="http://www.presidencia.pt/?idc=3&idl=2">Anibal Cavaco Silva</a> [official website] for the court to determine whether retirees and public workers were being treated unfairly under the terms of the country's constitution. In November the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_6999/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the ESM, is in line with European law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Representatives from the US, France, Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, New Zealand and the EU, along with executive directors of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/">International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy websites] reaffirmed their commitments to working together to end discrimination and violence towards the LGBT community. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13789&LangID=E">delivered remarks</a> [press release] commending the LGBT community and praising the fact that, "many countries have embarked on historic reforms&#8212;strengthening anti-discrimination laws, combating hate crime against LGBT people and sensitizing public opinion." The High Commissioner pointed out however, that major challenges still remain, including new laws in Eastern Europe and Africa that discriminate against the LGBT community. According to the UN, more than 76 countries still criminalize consensual adult same-sex relationships.

<p>LGBT individuals have gained increased rights globally in the last decade, but many still face discrimination and criminal punishment throughout the world. Last month US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-process-same-sex-visa-applications.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US will begin processing same-sex visa applications the same way opposite-sex visa applications are processed. Speaking at the US embassy in London, Kerry stated, "As long as a marriage has been performed in the jurisdiction that recognizes it, then that marriage is valid under US immigration laws." In June Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/putin-signs-bill-into-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill banning the promotion of "homosexual propaganda" among minors. The law also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/30/russia-putin-signs-gay-propaganda-ban-into-law/%22">imposes fines</a> [AFP report] of up to 5,000 rubles (USD $166) and creates the power to suspend legal entities for 90 days for citizens who disseminate information suggesting that homosexuality is "socially equivalent" to heterosexuality. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Trial proceedings were <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/icc-grants-kenya-leaders-request-to-postpone-trial.php">temporarily suspended</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, allowing Ruto to return to Kenya in response to the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57604047/kenya-westgate-mall-hostage-standoff-continues-59-dead-so-far-minister-says/">terrorist attack</a> [AP report] that claimed 72 lives. Ruto requested that the hearing be delayed until mid-October in order for him to properly deal with what he called an "on-going and extremely serious matter of national security." However, the trial has been scheduled to resume on Wednesday, allowing Ruto enough time to attend a memorial service for those who died in the attacks. 

<p>Ruto is on trial for three counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly fomenting violence following the 2007 elections, leading to the deaths of at least 1,100 people and the displacement of more than 600,000. Earlier this month Ruto <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-deputy-president-pleads-not-guilty-at-icc-trial.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges. Also this month Kenya's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">voted to withdraw from the ICC</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/forum/2013/09/charles-jalloh-kenya-icc.php">op-ed</a>].

In June, over strong objections from COPE, the Kansas Board adopted new guidelines promoting the teaching of scientific evolution and other natural explanations. COPE claims that these new standards will lead students to adopt mechanistic and atheistic views on the world. This, the organization asserts, is in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders].

<p>This is not the first time the Kansas Board of Education has seen controversy regarding its fluctuating scientific standards. In 2007 the Board <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17132925/ns/technology_and_science/t/kansas-board-boosts-evolution-education/#.UkWl1n_9U1d">repealed</a> [NBC report] science guidelines that questioned the accuracy of evolution. This act removed language adopted in 2005, <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/kansas-school-board-approves.php">requiring</a> [JURIST report] that students understand not only evolution, but also suggestions that life is too complex to have evolved without help from a higher power. In 1987 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html">Edwards v. Aguillard</a> [opinion] that states may not mandate public schools to teach creationism in order to balance evolution lessons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report details that currently the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] is the only DOJ component to have used UAS to support its mission. However, other DOJ components, such as the <a href="http://www.atf.gov/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> (ATF) [official website], plan to deploy UAS to support future operations. The DOJ justified its use of UAS because of the lack of practical difference between regular aerial surveillance and manned aircraft. The OIG report found, however, that the differences between the two systems raise privacy concerns due to the nature of UAS, which can be used in close proximity to a home and may be capable of flying for days at a time. The report calls on the DOJ to consider the need for a department-wide policy regarding UAS uses that could have significant privacy or other legal implications. The findings reveal that the FBI has has spent more than $3 million since the use of UAS beginning in 2006.

<p>The growing use of unmanned aerial surveillance and combat capable aircraft, otherwise known as drones, has drawn the attention of the world and become a <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">controversial topic</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In the US, drones operated by domestic agencies are conducting surveillance for border protection and crime prevention. In June the FBI <a href="http://www.paul.senate.gov/files/documents/071913FBIresponse.pdf">confirmed</a> [text, PDF] that it has used drones domestically 10 times. In March legal experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/legal-experts-tell-senate-drones-require-new-privacy-laws.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate regarding the growing need for privacy laws because of the rapid advance of drone technology and its increased use. The use of drones for targeted killings has raised international concern, though the community has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">yet to come to a consensus</a> [JURIST report] on the use of the technology for combating terrorism and other national security threats. Legal experts have <a href="/forum/2013/03/amos-guiora-drone-policy.php">advocated</a> [JURIST op-ed] for some form of judicial review in response to the US executive branch's practice of using drones to engage in the targeted killing of suspected terrorists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investigation is set to be finished by Monday, followed by a separate visit by the <a href="http://www.opcw.org">Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> (OPCW) [official website].

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Last week UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-praises-syria-for-signing-chemical-weapons-ban.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the Syrian government's formal agreement to sign and abide by the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=6357">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">OPCD</a> backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmichigan.jpg" alt="Gay Rights" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/treasury">Michigan Department of Treasury</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/taxes/DOMAnotice_434103_7.pdf">determined</a> [text, PDF] that same-sex spouses must file separate tax returns. In a one-page notice posted on the Treasury website, Michigan residents are advised that same-sex couples who file a joint federal income tax return must continue to file income tax returns for Michigan with each individual using the single filing status. The <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-act-281-of-1967.pdf">Michigan Income Tax Act</a> [text, PDF] limits a joint tax return to a married couple who are "husband and wife." The <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(x0tb3inwip5t0t45pabray55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> employs similar language, defining "marriage" under <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(jrw1on45suz0hm2q4onevw55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Article-I-25">Article 1 section 25</a> [text] as a union of one man and one woman. Although the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] ruled in August that any legal same-sex marriage <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">would be recognized</a> [JURIST report] for joint filing on federal tax returns, even if the couple lives in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriages, Michigan's constitutional language bars same-sex marriage recognition for any purpose.

<p>The IRS ruling followed the US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] which overturned Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. Since the ruling, states have split over whether to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. On Wednesday a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-expands-ohio-same-sex-marriage-challenge-to-other-couples.php">expanded a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking the recognition of same-sex spouses on death certificates. Judge Timothy Black ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">July</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">September</a> [JURIST reports] that the surviving same-sex spouses of two decedents should be listed as spouses on death certificates because their marriages were valid under the laws of the states where they were performed. Earlier this week a Kentucky judge ruled that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">not protected by the spousal privilege</a> [JURIST report] under Kentucky state law. Last month the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us">Texas Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it will consider <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/texas-supreme-court-to-rule-on-same-sex-divorce.php">whether the state has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to grant divorces to two same-sex couples who were legally married in Massachusetts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint provides:<blockquote>Article 100 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code (Treatment of Persons Prohibited under International Law) makes it a crime to intentionally, by carrying out or supporting the policy of the state or an organisation, unlawfully imprison or otherwise deprive persons of liberty in violation of international law; to torture; to detain, arrest or otherwise deprive them of liberty, where such a deprivation of liberty is not recognised, or to fail to report the fate or whereabouts of a person. Unlawful deprivation of liberty is also punishable under Article 146 of the Criminal Code. Article 292 of the Code prohibits unlawful transportation (and the organisation of such transportation) of persons across the state border and provides for criminal liability for unlawful transportation of &#8220;an alien not having a permanent place of residence in the Republic of Lithuania."</blockquote>Lithuanian prosecutors have not commented on the claims.

The act limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds and adds 45 guns to a banned list. The act also requires gun buyers to submit their fingerprints and obtain handgun qualification licenses, which would require four hours of handgun training. The lawsuits <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-gun-law-suit-20130927,0,5692536.story">argue</a> [Baltimore Sun report] that the act violates the Second Amendment by arbitrarily banning certain guns and that the act violates  equal protection under the law because retired police officers are not subject to certain provisions. Gun rights advocates filed the second lawsuit against Maryland's new gun law Friday, calling the licensing requirement a de facto ban on sales, since the <a href="https://www.mdsp.org/">Maryland State Police</a> [official website] are not ready to process the license applications quickly. The plaintiffs are also asking for a <a href="http://www.associatedgunclubs.org/legislative/temporary/SB_281_Litigation.pdf">temporary restraining</a> [text, PDF] order on the act.

<p>The act was proposed in January, a month after the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">sparked a national gun control debate</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The act <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the Maryland Senate in April. In April Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a comprehensive gun control bill into law, placing new limits on the sale of firearms. A month prior US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to pass three bills which would require background checks for all private gun sales, renew a grant to improve schools security programs and make the act of buying a weapon for someone barred from owning one a federal crime. Earlier in March, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging passage of gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines and military style assault weapons. In January Obama signed <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This law was required to allow the signing of the <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">EU-Ukraine Association Agreement</a> [EU backgrounder], which is expected to be signed in November. Ukraine's parliament, the <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/en">Verkhovna Rada</a> [official website], passed the measure early this month. The amendment, Law No 435-VII, amends the <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257">Criminal Code</a> [text] to make it easier both for prisoners to communicate with those outside and to receive treatment. There are 11 other benchmarks Ukraine is required to meet before the Association Agreement can be signed. 

<p>This is the latest in a number of economic and political reforms undertaken by the Ukrainian government in an effort to become closer to the EU. This topic was <a href="/sidebar/2013/03/kambiz-behi-edsel-tupaz-ukraine-eu.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] by JURIST guest columnists Kambiz Behi and Edsel Tupaz. Ukraine has faced worldwide criticism for its handling of the criminal trials of former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST news archive] and her supporters. In May, Ukraine's prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ukraine-prosecutor-reopens-murder-case-against-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] a murder case against ex-PM Tymoshenko.

In particular, the lawsuit seeks to block a requirement that physicians who provide abortions must obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital, which could cause at least one-third of the state's licensed clinics to close. The lawsuit also challenges restrictions on the use of abortion medication and requirements that women follow an older and less effective protocol. The legislation was <a href="https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/texas-health-care-providers-file-lawsuit-protect-abortion-access-texas">opposed</a> [ACLU press release] by 80 percent of Texas voters and faced criticism from medical experts across the country. The <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">Texas Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> the bill on to <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website], who <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] it into law on July 18.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. The US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in August against an <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/bills/hb2800p.pdf">Arizona law</a> [HB 2800, PDF] that disqualified health providers that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, from receiving public funds. Also in August, <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky</a> (PPINK) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/indiana-planned-parenthood-challenges-new-abortion-regulations.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.state.in.us/isdh/">Indiana State Department of Health</a> [official website] challenging a new regulation [text] that defined facilities prescribing Mifepristone as abortion clinics and required them meet regulatory requirements of surgical facilities, even when they do not provide surgical procedures. A similar bill, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> in Alabama in April, has received criticism as a <a href="/forum/2013/05/lajuana-davis-alabama-abortion.php">"back-door" attempt</a> [JURIST op-ed] to circumvent a woman's right to abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Mary Jacobson found that the current status of civil unions deprive same-sex couples of federal benefits enjoyed by married couples. In light of the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSBlog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">report</a>], Jacobson found that "Same-sex couples must be allowed to marry in order to obtain equal protection of the law under the New Jersey constitution." Opponents of the ruling claim that such a decision should be put to a referendum. This has long been the position of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/09/nj_superior_court_gay_marriage_ruling.html">vowed to appeal the ruling</a> [NJ News report]. Same-sex marriage supporters praised the decision as one step closer to achieving equality and plan to fight the state's eventual appeal.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Last week Michigan's Treasury Department <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/michigan-treasury-department-rules-same-sex-spouses-must-file-separate-tax-returns.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex spouses must file separate tax returns. On Wednesday a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-expands-ohio-same-sex-marriage-challenge-to-other-couples.php">expanded a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking the recognition of same-sex spouses on death certificates. Judge Timothy Black ruled in <ahref="g/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ohio-same-sex-couple-married-out-of-state.php">July</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-orders-same-sex-spouse-listed-on-death-certificate.php">September</a> [JURIST reports] that the surviving same-sex spouses of two decedents should be listed as spouses on death certificates because their marriages were valid under the laws of the states where they were performed. Earlier last week a Kentucky judge ruled that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">not protected by the spousal privilege</a> [JURIST report] under Kentucky state law</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI reports that the number of enforced disappearances in the nation has increased drastically since the federal government launched a military initiative to interrupt organized crime cells in 2006. According to the Mexican government more than 26,000 people have disappeared since then, and AI has documented more than 85 instances where public officials were involved. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/mexican-senate-must-end-impunity-armed-forces-human-rights-violations-2013-09-27">asserts</a> [press release] the Mexican military justice system is too broad in scope, often rendering the civilian justice system powerless. As a result, military courts investigate and try cases involving human rights violations committed by military personnel against civilians, which, according to AI, has resulted in prevailing impunity. AI urged Mexican lawmakers to implement measures immediately in order to align the nation's military justice framework with international standards.  

<p>"Enforced disappearances" refer to the practice of placing people in secret detention for weeks or months without ever being brought before a judge. In June AI called on the Mexican government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ai-mexico-must-investigate-disappearances.php">investigate the disappearances</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of people and acknowledge the government's involvement in the disappearances. AI's report stated 26,121 people were reported disappeared or missing between December 2006 and December 2012, but 40 percent of the cases were not investigated. In May the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-to-increase-human-rights-protections-reduce-military-in-policing.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Mexico's government to better protect against human rights abuses, particularly with respect to the military's use of force against civilians. In February Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mexico-security-forces-participated-in-forced-disappearances-hrw.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Mexican security forces have enforced or participated in widespread "disappearances" in which individuals are taken against their will.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two high-ranking army officials <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46111&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo#.UkhzfBZA_zI">escaped</a> [UN News Centre report] from Bukavu prison two weeks after a court sentenced them to life in prison for rape and murder. The UN fears the escapees will threaten the witnesses, lawyers and magistrates involved in the trial. MONUSCO urged Congolese authorities to provide protections for those involved and to investigate the circumstances and security failures leading to the nighttime escape. 

<p>Human rights and humanitarian issues continue to be a concern surrounding the violence in the DRC. Earlier this month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/drc-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the establishment of a national human rights commission in the DRC but said that rights abuses continue in the east. Also in September a top UN official <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-expert-calls-for-international-community-to-address-impunity-in-drc.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] the need to address the issue of impunity for those involved in human rights violations over the past year. In August UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia Pansieri said that <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-calls-for-drc-to-respect-human-rights.php">respecting human rights</a> [JURIST report] is essential to achieve stabilization in the DRC. In May the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that DRC troops committed numerous war crimes, including rape and murder, as they retreated from an advance by the 23 March Movement (M23) rebels last November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his editorial, Malmberg stated:<blockquote>There is no health-related basis for circumcising male babies in those cases the procedure is not medically justified. The procedure is painful, irreversible and can lead to serious complications. To circumcise a child without medical reasons and without the child has consented breaks in our opinion, to the child's human rights and the basic medical and ethical principles.</blockquote>Malmberg concluded with the assertion that Sweden's 2001 legislation authorizing circumcision be changed to only permit circumcision without medical grounds if the boy is of the age and maturity required to understand information about the procedure and consents to circumcision.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=circumcision">Circumcision</a> [JURIST news archive] remains controversial throughout the world. In June 2012 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-court-criminalizes-circumcision-of-minors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that circumcising young boys based on religious traditions was prohibited even if the parents consent to the procedure. The ruling was quickly <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/germany-passes-law-expressly-permitting-infant-male-circumcision.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by the German <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/">Parliament</a> [official website, in German], which in December approved a bill explicitly permitting male infant circumcision. Last August the Australian state of Tasmania <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/tasmania-legal-panel-proposes-ban-on-circumcisions.php">moved to ban male infant circumcision</a> [JURIST report] after the <a href="http://www.law.utas.edu.au/reform/">Tasmania Law Reform Institute</a> (TLRI) [official website] issued a report recommending that the state ban circumcision except for well-established religious and ethnic reasons. In October 2011 California <a href="http://www.jerrybrown.org/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/california-governor-signs-bill-prohibiting-circumcision-bans.php">prevents local governments from banning</a> [JURIST report] male circumcision. The law was written in response to a ballot measure proposed in San Francisco that would have made male circumcision illegal if the recipient was under the age of 18, with perpetrators penalized by a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kandil was imprisoned in April for <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/30/uk-egypt-kandil-sentence-idUKBRE98T0AT20130930">failing to follow a court order</a> [Reuters report] to re-nationalize a textile company sold by former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">news archive</a>]. Kandil's administration argued that re-nationalizing the textile company would be extremely difficult, as the company had been dissolved since it was sold to a foreign investor. Egyptian courts have issued at least eleven rulings in the past two years ordering the government to reverse deals signed during Mubarak's reign.

<p>Although Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago, the conflict peaked in July after the military deposed president Morsi, suspended the nation's constitution and installed an interim government. Last week an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">banned the Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST report] and ordered its assets confiscated as part of the military government's crackdown on the group. Earlier that week JURIST guest columnist Liesel LeCates <a href="/dateline/2013/09/liesel-lecates-egypt-sentences.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] whether recent sentences by an Egyptian military tribunal against supporters of Morsi were fair. Two weeks ago Egyptian police <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-police-arrest-muslim-brotherhood-spokesperson.php">arrested a spokesperson</a> [JURIST report] for the Muslim Brotherhood. Three weeks ago the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-extends-state-of-emergency-for-two-months.php">extended emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] put in place in mid-August. Earlier in September an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-orders-closure-of-four-media-outlets.php">ordered the closure</a> [JURIST report] of four media outlets, including an affiliate of Al Jazeera, for their alleged support of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lifting of the ban is part of a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-30/turkey-announces-human-rights-reforms-end-ban-headscarves/4990142">package of human rights reforms</a> [ABC News report] that Erdogan proposed, which also include allowing Kurdish language education and reducing barriers to entry for Kurdish political parties. The new rules regarding headscarves will not apply to the military or the judiciary, however.

<p>Niqabs, burqas and other traditional Muslim garments have been a controversial subject worldwide. Last week a region of Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/switzerland-region-votes-to-ban-full-face-veils.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to ban the wearing of full-face veils.

Earlier that week a Quebec official <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/quebec-official-proposes-bill-banning-religious-headwear-for-public-workers.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] banning religious headwear for public workers.

Yadav and 44 others were <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/30/india-court-convicts-ruling-party-ally-in-10s-graft-case/">found guilty</a> [AFP report] of conspiracy and cheating over a scam in the mid 1990s that siphoned USD $6 million of public money. The conviction renders Yadav one of the first politicians to fall under a July Supreme Court ruling which would <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/india-supreme-court-rules-convicted-lawmakers-must-vacate-positions.php">disqualify him from office</a> [JURIST report] if found guilty of a serious crime. He could face a minimum of four years in jail. Yadav denies the charges and plans to appeal. A Congress MP, Rashid Masood, may also be disqualified after being convicted in a separate corruption case earlier this month.

<p>Corruption remains a serious issue in India. In July, the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] ruled that elected representatives convicted of serious crimes must vacate their positions immediately and be disqualified from future elections. Last year JURIST Columnist Edsel Tupaz and Guest Columnist Joan Martinez argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/india-upper-parliament-house-fails-to-pass-anti-corruption-bill.php">stalled anti-corruption legislation</a> [JURIST report] before the Indian Parliament should <a href="/sidebar/2012/02/tupaz-martinez-india.php">do more to fight corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed], particularly by creating a more powerful ombudsman position to hold government officials accountable. According to the authors, "India's Parliament must make sure that its proposed ombudsman will wield strong, concrete and independent powers beyond nominal authority."</p>]]></content:encoded>

This could permit Illinois state courts to decide whether same-sex couples will be allowed to marry in Illinois or have marriages obtained in other states recognized within the state of Illinois. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website] filed the lawsuits on behalf of 25 same-sex couples last year after the clerk of Cook County refused both to marry same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages obtained in other states. Illinois currently permits civil unions, and the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/senate/">Illinois Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] last February to permit same-sex marriage, but the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] never voted on the bill.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, and has generated <a href="/dateline/2013/09/stephen-richer-gay-marriage.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] stemming from that polarization. A judge for New Jersey's Mercer County Superior Court in Trenton <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/new-jersey-judge-rules-same-sex-couples-must-be-allowed-to-marry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Friday that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry. Last week Michigan's Treasury Department <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/michigan-treasury-department-rules-same-sex-spouses-must-file-separate-tax-returns.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex spouses must file separate tax returns. Last Wednesday a judge for the US <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-expands-ohio-same-sex-marriage-challenge-to-other-couples.php">expanded a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking the recognition of same-sex spouses on death certificates.  Earlier last week a Kentucky judge ruled that the same-sex spouse of a woman charged with murder must testify against her at the trial because same-sex partners are <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">not protected by spousal privilege</a> [JURIST report] under Kentucky state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Particularly, the DOJ takes issue with the bill's reduction of days allotted for early voting, prohibition on the counting of certain ballots and strict requirement of photo identification cards. According to the DOJ, these restrictions were "adopted with the purpose, and will have the result, of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group." The lawsuit was filed with the intent to bar North Carolina from enforcing these new requirements and to "ensure that the changes do not have a discriminatory effect or a discriminatory purpose."

The law would effectively <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57598224/lawsuit-hits-n.c-as-soon-as-voter-id-bill-approved/">roll back the early voting period</a> [CBS report] and repeal one-stop registration during early voting. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/">North Carolina General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-voter-id-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in July, despite criticism from Democrats who argued that the legislation would have the effect of disenfranchising many voters. North Carolina was the first state to make changes to its voting laws after June's US Supreme Court ruling, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder].
