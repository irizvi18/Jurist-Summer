		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontprison.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Washington Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/840393.opn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 on Thursday that holding death row inmates in solitary confinement indefinitely is not an impermissible increase in the severity of punishment. The suit was initiated by Jonathan Gentry, who was sentenced to death in 1991 for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl and is the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013808999_gentry31m.html">longest serving death row inmate in the state</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report]. In 2008, budget constraints forced <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/6420ap_wa_scow_death_row_confinement.html">Washington to close the Special Housing Unit</a> (SHU) [AP report] which afforded death row inmates family contact visits and daily interaction with other prisoners. Gentry alleged that the imposition of solitary confinement after the closure of the SHU was an impermissible <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">ex post facto</a> [LII backgrounder] punishment. In rejecting Gentry's petition, the court noted:<blockquote>Mr. Gentry does not challenge his conviction or general confinement to prison as ... unlawful.  Instead, he claims that his removal from the SHU and placement in the IMU [solitary confinement] has subjected him to more restrictive conditions of confinement in violation of the prohibition on ex post facto punishment.  Gentry's claim presupposes a liberty interest in residing in the SHU or in retaining the privileges afforded there.  The Washington and United States Constitutions do not create a liberty interest in a particular form of prison housing, absent allegations of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, which Gentry does not assert.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/840393.no1.pdf">dissenting</a> [opinion, PDF] justices noted that budget limitations could not fully account for the suspension of all privileges associated with the SHU and that insufficient evidence existed to rule properly on Gentry's petition.

<p>Ballooning prison populations and budget constraints have stretched prison systems and raised numerous prisoner rights issues. In late December the US District Court for the District of Colorado issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-12-20-MartinezvMaketa-OrderGrantingPI.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] against a county jail policy that restricted outgoing correspondence to 4x6 postcards provided by the jail. After that decision, the jail <a href="http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/jail-drops-postcard-only-policy-following-aclu-lawsuit">discontinued that policy</a> [ACLU press release]. In November, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-california-prison-overcrowding-case.php">federal court order to reduce the California prison population</a> [JURIST report]. The order would require the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates as part of a plan to reduce chronic overcrowding for the past 20 years.  In September, <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/canada-to-spend-105-million-on-prison-expansions-in-anticipation-of-prisoner-increase.php">Canada announced $105 million allocated for new prison cells</a> [JURIST report] at existing locations in anticipation of expanding prison populations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Y.J. Choi, head of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/">UN Ivory Coast Operation</a> (UNOCI) [official website], said Gbagbo's supporters "Cannot possibly take the Golf Hotel. We are heavily armed and present and preparing ourselves.  They will be defeated. There is no doubt about this. I hope [they] will not step into this fatal minefield." Also on Friday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official biography] told the press that she has sent a letter to Gbagbo reiterating his obligation under international law to avoid any form of complicity in human rights violations. She reiterated the UN's position that he and his administration will be held directly responsible for reported widespread abuses that have ensued in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/23/AR2010122302954.html">violence following the November runoff election</a> [WP report]. Of particular concern, stated Pillay, is the reported existence of several <a href="http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/15206">mass graves</a> [<em>Newstime Africa</em> report]: <blockquote>We have received reports of at least two mass graves; however, UN human rights teams have been denied access to the scenes of these atrocities in order to investigate them. Denying access to alleged mass grave sites and places where the victims' mortal remains are allegedly deposited constitutes a clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.</blockquote> In a <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/">United Nations Radio</a> [official website] appearance Friday, Choi <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/detail/110476.html">said</a> [audio clip] that UN officials twice attempted to investigate the sites and were denied access by Gbagbo's forces both times. 

<p>Ouattara defeated Gbagbo in a November 28 runoff election, but Gbagbo has refused to concede victory or leave office. During the post-election violence that ensued, hundreds have been arrested and dozens have allegedly been subjected to torture, ill treatment and forced disappearances. Earlier this week, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-urges-parties-to-prevent-ethnic-crimes-in-post-election-ivory-coast.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all parties to the disputed presidential election to honor the country's commitment to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity under the 2005 <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement">World Summit Outcome Document</a> [text, PDF]. Last week, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations Refugee Agency</a>  (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/4d1634909.html">expressed concern</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-agency-reports-thousands-of-ivory-coast-refugees-fleeing-to-liberia.php">report</a>] over the humanitarian needs of nearly 14,000 Ivory Coast refugees who have fled to Liberia over the past month due to post-election political instability and violence. The UNHCR warned that food supplies and housing are running short as refugees are increasingly arriving malnourished and fighting disease. Earlier in December, the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ecowas-threatens-use-of-force-in-removal-of-ivory-coast-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Gbagbo to step down, threatening the use of force if he attempts to maintain power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unless the appeal succeeds, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are expected to remain imprisoned through 2017 after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] last week in the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovinchesky District Court</a> [olfficial website, in Russian] on charges connected with his embezzlement of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101227/wl_afp/russiapoliticstrialrights">more than $27 billion</a> [AFP report] from Yukos oil. Before their conviction last week, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were already serving eight-year prison sentences for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Defense counsel have staunchly criticized last week's verdict, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission. The verdict drew vehement <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution." The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable." In May, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. In March, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized the Russian justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,,YEM,3fc4c1e94,0.html">Yemeni constitution</a> [text, PDF] permits the president to sit for a maximum of two consecutive seven-year terms, but the draft amendment would shorten the term length to five years and eliminate the two-term cap. The measure was adopted with 170 votes by a parliament dominated by the ruling <a href="http://www.gpc.org.ye/">General People's Congress</a> (GPC) [party website] of <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php?lng=en">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website]. In an interview with al-Saeeda TV last week, Sultan al-Barakani, head of the GPC's parliamentary bloc, said that the party's aim in adopting the measure is to <a href="http://www.newsyemen.net/en/view_news.asp?sub_no=3_2010_12_29_40235">make Saleh president for life</a> [<em>News Yemen</em> report].  Saleh was elected for the first time in 1999 and began his second term in 2006. On Sunday, the <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Yemeni-Socialist-Party">Yemeni Socialist Party</a> (YSP) [NationMaster backgrounder], the GPC's primary opposition, joined with a coalition of minority parties and independents in the Yemeni parliament in accusing the GPC of undermining the republic's democratic rule and <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110102-yemen-opposition-urge-protests-against-amendments">called for protests</a> [AFP report] opposing the amendments. In anticipation of the vote Friday, US State Department spokesman Mark Toner issued a <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/12/153810.htm">statement</a> [text] "urgently calling on all parties to delay parliamentary action and to return to the negotiating table" before adopting any such amendments. The GPC <a href="http://www.azer-news.com/news/yemen-slams-us-interference-over-constitution-changes">rebuffed</a> [<em>Azer-News</em> report] the statement Saturday as undue interference in the nation's affairs. The Yemeni Parliament is expected to hear more detailed debate on the amendments in March before putting the matter to a referendum along with parliamentary voting on April 27.

<p>The popular Saleh, who has been in power in Yemen since 1978, has generally been considered friendly to the US and an ally in the war on terror, but his GPC's efforts to amend the Yemeni constitution in recent years have caused mounting political tensions in the Arabian Peninsula's only republic. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission.  That amendment was part of a package of measures, along with Saturday's abolition of term limits, that was <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/257548,yemeni-parliament-elections-postponement-until-2011.html">originally proposed in 2009</a> after the GPC and YSP agreed in an EU-brokered deal to delay elections until the electoral process could be reformed. In 2008, the Yemeni parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/yemen-parliament-rejects-electoral.php">failed to adopt a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have restricted government officials from influencing parliamentary ballots. The GPC majority voted as a bloc against the bill, while the YSP, eight senior members of which were being tried on corruption charges at the time, boycotted the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Log Cabin Republicans</span>, a case regarding the constitutionality of the military's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) policy [10 USC &#167; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don't+ask+don't+tell">news archive</a>]. The government asked Wednesday for a 90-day delay in the briefing schedule in light of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [text and materials], which President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] on December 22. Under the current briefing schedule, the government's opening brief would be due on January 24. The government argues that proceeding with briefs would interfere with the repeal schedule that the act already sets in place. The repeal will become effective 60 days after the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense</a> [official profile] receives a plan for the repeal's implementation from the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] and the plan is approved by the president, secretary, and chairman of the <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> (JCS) [official website]. Until that time, the current DADT policy is to remain in effect. The government argues in its motion that the repeal act brings about a significant change in the law and that notions of judicial economy and respect for political branches mandates that the process outlined in the act is allowed to proceed without interference. The motion further states that the court action questioning the constitutionality of DADT would be unnecessary following the enactment of the repeal act. The government stated that it will advise the court within 90 days about the status of the certification process for the repeal's implementation. The <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> [advocacy website], the group that initiated suit in  2004, stated that it will <a href="http://www.logcabin.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=nsKSL7PMLpF&b=6420733&ct=8984259">continue its lawsuit</a> [press release] during the act's implementation until DADT is not longer in force.

<p>In October, Judge Virginia Phillips of the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Central District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">ordered the US military to end enforcement of the DADT policy</a> [JURIST report]. The order came more than a month after the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">declared the policy unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Following the ruling, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/doj-asks-court-not-to-enforce-ruling-overturning-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">asked the district court not to enforce its decision</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the ruling was overbroad and that the military should be permitted time to implement a non-judicial solution to the issue.

Nemtsov, leader of the opposition group <a href="http://www.rusolidarnost.ru/">Solidarity</a> [advocacy website, in Russian], and an outspoken critic of Russian <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>], was arrested alongside about 20 others on New Year's Eve when they disobeyed police orders to disperse and tried to lead a crowd of more than 2,000 on a march through Pushkin Square. Russian authorities assert that arrests were only made after Nemtsov and other leaders attempted to lead the group through police ranks, but opposition leaders and human rights activists have decried the arrests as <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/nemtsov_jailing_draws_criticism/2265919.html">baseless and politically motivated</a> [RFE/RL report]. The assembly, which police did permit to proceed in a small square near the Kremlin, was one of a series of assemblies opposition groups have held on the 31st day of the month for the last several years. The timing of the protests is symbolic of Article 31 of the <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/constit.html">Russian Constitution</a> [text], which guarantees the right to assemble.

<p>Russian authorities continue to draw fire from human rights groups and the Western world for what is seen a increasingly draconian suppression of Putin's rivals. Last week, oil tycoon <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] and his business partner, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense profile], were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] on charges of fraud and embezzlement stemming from their <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101227/wl_afp/russiapoliticstrialrights">embezzlement of more than $27 billion</a> [AFP report] from Yukos Oil between 1998 and 2003. The men, who were already in prison serving sentences for tax evasion, saw their terms increased by six years in a trial that was widely <a href="http://zaprava.ru/201012302643/glavnyie-novosti-dnya/novogodnee-pozdravlenie-lva-ponomareva-edinomyshlennikam">decried</a> [Movement for Human Rights press release, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">op-ed</a>] for apparent political motives and failures of due process. They <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/khodorkovsky-appeals-extended-sentence.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week. Nemtsov was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/russia-rights-activists-detained-in.php">arrested in a similar incident</a> [JURIST report] early in February 2010, when he and about 100 others were detained in Moscow as they protested perceived government curtailment of the right to peacably assemble. The actions of the Russian government in breaking up similar protests in December 2009 earned criticism from US President Barack Obama after the founder of Russia's oldest rights group, the <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/english">Moscow Helsinki Group</a> [advocacy website] 82-year-old Lyudmila Alexeyeva was arrested.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Karroubi said his only request is that the trial be open and fair, a challenge that could galvanize reformers and opposition to Ahmadinejad's rule. Many believed Ahmadinejad's victory over <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8103851.stm">Hossein Mousavi</a> [BBC profile] was achieved by fraud, leading to a rash of protests and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/done-four-killed-hundreds-arrested-in.php">outbreaks of violence</a> [JURIST report] that resulted in hundreds of arrests. After opposition activity subsided, the government refrained from trying Mousavi and other opposition leaders who <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-opposition-candidate-mousavi-calls.php">called for continuing protests</a> [JURIST report]. However, Iranian chief prosecutor said Friday that he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">intends to prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report], including Mousavi, Karoubi and former Iranian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3027382.stm">Mohammad Khatami</a> [BBC profile]. Dolataabadi's remarks echoed those made in a speech delivered the previous day by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3018932.stm">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [BBC profile] at a pro-government rally.

<p>Karroubi and the other three leaders could join a long line of individuals detained or already prosecuted for their roles during the election protests. In September, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist arrested after the 2009 elections, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iran-court-sentences-journalist-charged-with-warring-against-god-to-six-years.php">sentenced to six years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for charges including "warring against God" and distributing anti-government propaganda. Also in September, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent Iranian human rights lawyer known for representing political activists following the 2009 election, was detained for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-detained.php">spreading propaganda and colluding against national security</a> [JURIST report]. In August, an Iranian court sentenced Qorban Behzadianejad, Mousavi's campaign manager, to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/aid-to-iran-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-report.php">five years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. The Iranian government detained hundreds of protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">sentenced several to death</a> [JURIST report]. Khamenei <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iran-supreme-leader-pardons-81-post-election-protesters.php">pardoned or commuted the sentences of 81 protesters</a> [JURIST report] in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint was filed by <a href="http://www.ugandans4rights.org/index.php">Uganda's Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of three members who, along with 97 other individuals, were alleged to be homosexuals in an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/21/ugandan-paper-gay-people-hanged">article published by the tabloid</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] under the headline "Hang Them" in October 2010. In addition to listing the individuals' names, the tabloid also published many of their photographs, addresses and preferred social hang-outs, which the high court ruled constituted an infringement of their fundamental rights to privacy and dignity. The decision is being celebrated by human rights groups as "landmark in the struggle for the protection of human dignity and the right to privacy irrespective of one's sexual orientation."

<p>Uganda has been harshly criticized throughout the international community since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8308912.stm">introduction</a> [BBC report] in October 2009 of its <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">Anti-Homosexuality Bill</a> [text, PDF], which has since been stalled in the Parliament. In January of last year, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">said the bill was discriminatory</a> [JURIST report] and could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. Additionally, in February, US President Barack Obama and <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report], which would implement harsh punishments for homosexual behavior, including the death penalty in some circumstances. The bill also imposes punishments of up to three years in prison for individuals, including family members, who fail to report the identity of a person who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered within 24 hours. Uganda currently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8412962.stm">criminalizes homosexual behavior</a> [BBC report] with up to 14 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Karzai has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/world/asia/04kabul.html?_r=1">promised to have the parliament seated</a> [NYT report] on time amid controversy surrounding the results of last September's <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=4&cnid=46">parliamentary elections</a> [IEC backgrounder]. However, the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website] claims that the panel does not have legal authority to question the results that it certifies. It claims that the law says it has the final say in determining the elections results and that the Supreme Court is setting a dangerous precedent by ruling outside its mandate. Controversy surrounds the ethnic representation of the parliament as a result of the elections. The Pashtuns, of which Karzai is a member, make up over half the country's population but only won 94 out of 249 seats. The winning candidates and some critics from the West <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704835504576059510767583524.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">argue</a> [WSJ report] that the panel is meant to bolster Karzai's support in government, but his office has denied such accusations saying that the panel is independent. The panel is facing more than 400 cases of alleged fraud to investigate over the next two weeks.

<p>Last week Karzai approved the Supreme Court's plan to review the last September's parliamentary elections which were marred by irregularities and accusations of fraud. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php">disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the IEC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures. The 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] of Karzai was also marred by fraud allegations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Taseer, a senior member of the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a> (PPP) [official website], was shot while getting into his car at Islamabad's Kohsar Market and died later at a hospital. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the guard immediately surrendered to police and confessed to shooting Taseer because he had spoken against the blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year. Tasseer had spoken in Bibi's defense. This is the most high-profile assassination in Pakistan since the 2007 assassination of former prime minister and PPP leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>].

<p>The blasphemy laws were introduced in 1986 as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults. In response to repeated calls for repeal, Pakistani <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Mom/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNLE_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIo_LBEMTfT-P_NxU_YLs7DRHR0VFAGW7A9Q%21/dl2/d1/L0lDU0lKSWdrbUEhIS9JRFJBQUlpQ2dBek15cXchL1lCSkoxTkExTkk1MC01RncvN19VRkpQQ0dDMjBPVVFFMDJFVDlGTVBKMzBPMC9Ga19fXzE3/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_UFJPCGC20OUQE02ET9FMPJ30O0_WCM&amp;WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MomCL/ministry/about/minister">Federal Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti</a> [official profile] has said the laws may be amended to prevent misuse, but they will not be repealed. Advocacy groups such as <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hrw-urges-repeal-of-pakistan-blasphemy-laws.php">Human Rights Watch</a> [JURIST report], as well as <a href="/forum/2010/11/no-space-for-democracy-and-rule-of-law-blasphemy-laws-in-pakistan.php">LHC advocate Saroop Ijaz</a> [JURIST op-ed] have called for the laws to be repealed. In February, Bhatti told the Agence France-Presse that he has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-to-revise-blasphemy-laws.php">speaking to various political parties</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan and that his government is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gN_fU6rinxd4J-egRTpxlQrY5sdA">committed to doing away with laws</a> [AFP report] that are discriminatory to minorities. Bhatti made the comments at an interview with the AFP in Washington, DC, where he met with various lawmakers and officials during the National Prayer Breakfast. Bhatti discussed a proposed change in the law that would force judges to investigate blasphemy cases before they are docketed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcaliforniaseal.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S166600.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that law enforcement officers can legally search text messages on a suspect's cell phone without a warrant incident to a lawful custodial arrest. The court held 5-2 that a search of the defendant's cell phone text messages in the police station 90 minutes after the arrest did not violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure without exigent circumstances. The majority based its decision on the 1970s Supreme Court cases <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/415/800/">United States v. Edwards</a> and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/414/218/case.html">United States v. Robinson</a> [opinions], which held, respectively, that warrantless searches incident to arrest were valid of a suspect's clothes for paint chips and a cigarette packet taken from the suspect's person. The court distinguished the case from from <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/433/1/">United States v. Chadwick</a> [opinion text], which held that luggage could not be searched incident to arrest without exigent circumstances. The court held that a cell phone is more similar to the cigarette packet obtained from the suspect in <span class="casename">Robinson</span> or clothes searched in <span class="casename">Edwards</span> than the luggage in <span class="casename">Chadwick</span> because a cell phone is "immediately associated with [the defendant's] person." The defendant had argued that cell phones are not like the cigarette pack in <span class="casename">Edwards</span> because they are often not carried directly on the person but in a bag or within the person's reach and that cell phones are unlike any other personal item because they store such a wealth of personal information and data. The dissent, written by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, argued that modern cell phones are unprecedented information storage devices requiring that the balance between privacy interests and public safety interests "must be newly evaluated."

<p>The California decision represents a split from a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">2009 decision</a> [JURST report] by the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] holding that police must obtain a warrant before searching data stored on a cell phone. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] denied <em>certiorari</em> on that case but the split <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/03/BA5N1H3G12.DTL&tsp=1">may force it to rule on the issue</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report]. In June, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">report</a>] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1332">City of Ontario v. Quon</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an employer's search of private text messages on a work-issued device does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the search is motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and is not excessive in scope. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Most of the citizens of the camp are members of the <a href = "http://www.english.mojahedin.org">People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran</a> (MEK) [advocacy website], the largest Iranian opposition organization, whose members are considered protected persons under the Geneva Conventions. Although Spain has no discernible involvement in the situation, Andreu cited <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/9ac284404d38ed2bc1256311002afd89/6f96ee4c7d1e72cac12563cd0051c63a!OpenDocument">section 146 of the Geneva Conventions</a> [text] as the basis for his investigation. The probe will continue through the obligation of Geneva signatories to prosecute violations to the Geneva Conventions, despite Spain's October 2009 passage of a law <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limiting its use</a> [JURIST report] of <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] to cases involving Spanish citizens. The <a href = "http://www.mofa.gov.iq/">Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] claims to have launched an investigation into the situation and criticized the Spanish courts for <a href = "http://www.elpais.com/psp/index.php?module=elp_pdapsp&page=elp_pda_noticia&idNoticia=20110104elpepinac_9.Tes&seccion=nac">interfering with its authority</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish], but Andreu found this investigation "insufficient." Al Shemmari's summons is for March 8 in Madrid, but, as active duty military personnel, he may be unable to appear. If he does not appear, proceedings with continue without him.

<p>Before the law was changed in October 2009, Spain allowed the exercise of universal jurisdiction over foreign torture, terrorism and war crimes if the case was not subject to the legal system of the country involved, regardless of its connection to Spain. In June 2009, human rights groups <a href = "/paperchase/2009/06/rights-groups-urge-spain-to-continue.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Spanish government to continue the broad exercise of universal jurisdiction, while some countries, including <a href = "http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1059964.html">Israel</a> [Haaretz report], <a href = "/paperchase/2009/01/spain-may-legislate-to-limit-universal.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] for changes to the practice. Universal jurisdiction has been used by prominent Spanish judge <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Garzon">Baltazar Garzon</a> [JURIST news archive] to bring several high-profile cases, including those against <a href = "/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href = "/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives]. Investigations have also proceeded against <a href = "/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-to-investigate-israeli-role.php">Israeli actions in Gaza in 2002</a>, detainee abuse at <a href = "/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> and allegations of war crimes and genocide in <a href = "/paperchase/2008/02/spain-judge-indicts-40-rwanda-military.php">Rwanda</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2006/01/spain-high-court-to-rule-on-tibetan.php">Tibet</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2006/02/spain-court-to-try-guatemala-genocide.php">Guatemala</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2008/08/spain-court-to-hear-suit-against-china.php">China</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law, which entered into force this week, creates the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media and Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the new law, the government can fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority, whose members are all loyal to the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Rovat=10036">Fidesz party</a> [party website, in Hungarian]. The new law has been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1344032/Front-page-protests-Hungary-media-law-threatens-fines-unbalanced-coverage.html">harshly criticized</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] by members of the media, as well as other European governments, as too restrictive of free expression, and the European Commission has requested more information on the law to determine whether it complies with EU law. The Hungarian government, which assumed the EU presidency on January 1, has nevertheless continued to defend the law, with Zoltan Kovacs, state secretary for communication, telling national radio Tuesday that it is <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/hungary-unmoved-eu-criticism-over-media-law">unnecessary to change the law</a> [ANP/AFP report].

<p>The <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">Hungarian Parliament</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BK6KF20101221">approved the law</a> [Reuters report] in December, amid protests and criticism. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/">Constitutional Court of Hungary</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/hungary-hate-speech-amendments.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two proposals passed by the country's parliament to criminalize hate speech as unconstitutional infringements on the freedom of expression. The court held that the extremist speech that the amendments sought to prevent was not a danger to society because it was already marginalized. The first bill would have allowed recovery in cases where a person's ethnic group, rather than the individual person, was insulted. The second bill would have designated national, ethnic, racial or religious insults as misdemeanors punishable by up to two years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The archdiocese's purpose in filing the petition is to achieve the dual goals of compensating remaining victims and survivors of the abuses and continuing to carry out essential ministerial functions of the archdiocese. Listecki expressed his belief that Chapter 11 reorganization was the best approach to address these goals:<blockquote> It enables the archdiocese to use available funds to compensate all victims/survivors with unresolved claims in a single process overseen by a court, ensuring that all are treated equitably.  In addition, by serving as a final call for legal claims against the archdiocese, the proceeding will allow the archdiocese to provide closure and resolution so we can move forward on stable financial ground, focused on our Gospel mission.</blockquote>The Chapter 11 process provides federal court supervision of the development of a plan that requires that the remaining archdiocesan resources are allocated fairly. Additionally, the  plan must be feasible and not likely to require any further modifications to keep the archdiocese financially viable. The archdiocese expects the reorganization process to be complete within 12 to 18 months.

<p>Further heightening the financial frustrations of Milkwaukee's diocese is the recent Wisconsin Court of Appeals decision, which <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&seqNo=56872">held</a> [opinion text] that insurance companies do not have to contribute to the clergy abuse settlements. Milkwaukee is now the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/us/05milwaukee.html">eighth American diocese to file for bankruptcy</a> [NYT report] in response to the clergy sex scandals. Other state dioceses, such as <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/vermont-catholic-diocese-reaches-settlement-in-clergy-abuse-cases.php">Vermont</a> [JURIST report], have resorted to selling church property and securing loans as means to meet the financial demands of the abuse settlements. Since 2007, in the US alone, the Catholic Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled more than 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of abuse for over $900 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Vaughn Walker of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report] in August. Then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] were originally defendants in the lawsuit, but they <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report], leaving defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Project Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law. The Ninth Circuit asked the Supreme Court to answer the following question:<blockquote>Whether under Article II, Section 8 of the California Constitution, or otherwise under California law, the official proponents of an initiative measure possess either a particularized interest in the initiative&#8217;s validity or the authority to assert the State&#8217;s interest in the initiative&#8217;s validity, which would enable them to defend the constitutionality of the initiative upon its adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the initiative, when the public officials charged with that duty refuse to do so.</blockquote>If the court answers in the negative, the Ninth Circuit would likely dismiss the case, and it is unclear whether Walker's ruling would stand. The parties disagree as to what effect a dismissal would have, and the circuit court noted the issue but did not address it. Also Tuesday, the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/04/1016751op.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision refusing to allow officials from <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-county-commences-appeal-of-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">Imperial County, California</a> [JURIST report] to intervene, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1990&amp;cid=21&amp;ctype=ac&amp;instate=09">Judge Stephen Reinhardt</a> [FJC profile] issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/04/1016696memo.pdf">memorandum opinion</a> [text, PDF] on his <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-judge-declines-to-recuse-himself-from-propositon-8-case.php">decision not to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_vid=0000006121">heard  oral arguments</a> [video; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">report</a>] in the case, <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000472">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> [case materials] last month. The hearing was divided into two one-hour sessions, with the first section focusing on the issue of standing, and the second focusing on Proposition 8's constitutionality. In August, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">issued a stay</a> [JURIST report] on Walker's ruling, pending appeal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice M. Margaret McKeown declared, "[t]he use of such a distinctively Christian symbol to honor all veterans sends a strong message of endorsement and exclusion. It suggests that the government is so connected to a particular religion that it treats that religion's symbolism as its own, as universal." Although the cross was found unconstitutional, there was no order for removal, and the court suggested the monument could be altered to achieve constitutionality, without giving any specific recommendations. The <a href = "http://www.aclusandiego.org">American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], one of the parties to the case, <a href = "http://www.aclusandiego.org/news_item.php?article_id=001100">stated</a> [press release] that they were, "pleased that the court recognized the fundamental principle barring the government from playing favorites with religion." The <a href = "http://www.soledadmemorial.com/">Mount Soledad Memorial Association</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/jan/04/federal-court-rules-mount-soledad-cross-unconstitu/">plans to appeal</a> [KPBS News] to the US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], citing Justice Anthony Kennedy's <a href = "/paperchase/2006/07/supreme-court-stay-on-removal-of-san.php">stay on removing the cross</a> [JURIST report] in July 2006 as hope that that the court will rule in their favor.

<p>In April, the US Supreme Court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-on-religious.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-472">Salazar v. Buono</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the lower courts were wrong to ban the government from transferring public land containing a religious symbol to a private entity. This is similar to a long-standing proposed solution for the Mount Soledad cross, as the ACLU has suggested <a href = "http://www.aclusandiego.org/article_downloads/000899/Soledad%20Cross%20History%20current.pdf">moving the cross to a private religious site</a> [ACLU backgrounder, PDF]. In August 2006, then-president George W. Bush <a href = "/paperchase/2006/08/bush-signs-bill-expropriating-san.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.05683:">bill</a> [HR 5863 summary; <a href = "http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h5683enr.txt.pdf">PDF text</a>] into law that transferred ownership of the Mount Soledad cross to the federal government. The cross, which was erected as a Korean War veterans memorial, has been the center of a religious dispute for 21 years, which began when Philip Paulson, a Vietnam veteran and atheist, challenged the cross as a government endorsement of religion prohibited under the First Amendment and filed the original suit in 1989. Paulson died in 2006. Recently, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">highway memorial crosses</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">crosses on license plates</a>  [JURIST reports] have also been found unconstitutional by federal courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google was allegedly excluded because of security concerns, but the company says it has created a special application, Google Government Apps, that addresses all of these concerns. Furthermore, the company argues its application would save US taxpayers millions of dollars. The DOI may now continue to dispute Google's claim or elect to consider Google's bid.

<p>Over the past year, Google's privacy practices and policies have been the focus of numerous investigations and complaints. In October, the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into Google's internal policies and procedures that led to the company inadvertently collecting data on unsecured wireless networks while photographing streetscapes for its Street View maps program. Also in October, Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart announced that Google was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF] (PIPEDA). In August, the <a href="http://www.police.go.kr/">South Korean National Police Agency</a> (SKNPA) [official website, in Korean] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">raided the Google South Korean headquarters</a> [JURIST report] in connection with accusations that the company had been illegally acquiring user data. In July, the Australian Privacy Commissioner <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that its investigation revealed Google's actions violated the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/law">Australia Privacy Act</a> [government backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The soldiers were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iPn6fTG5Mq0xij6qLnVVj93MFuNg">charged</a> [AFP report] in July with crimes including murder, conspiracy and looting military weapons, among others. This is the latest in a series of military and civil trials for the thousands of citizens and soldiers involved in the mutiny, which left 74 dead, but these charges are the most serious to date with those found guilty of murder facing the death penalty. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12123651">trial</a> [BBC report], which is expected to last over a year and to include the testimonies of more than1,000 individuals, was adjourned until February 3, when the charges against the defendants will be read in full.

<p>In August, a special Bangladeshi military court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-court-convicts-14-border-guards-in-mutiny-trial.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] border guard for their roles in the mutiny. The tribunal, led by BDR head Maj. Gen. Mainul Islam, fined each of the men Tk 100 and <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=169661&cid=2">sentenced</a> [BDNews24 report] them to prison terms ranging from four months to six years, one year short of the maximum possible sentence for rebellion under Bangladeshi law. About 3,500 other soldiers will face lesser charges in military courts, which have already <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/bangladesh-court-convicts-dozens-more.php">convicted more than 200</a> [JURIST report]. Six special courts were <a href="http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=2&id=145334&hb=top">established</a> [BD News report] shortly after the Bangladeshi <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/bangladesh-high-court-recommends.php">recommended against</a> [JURIST report] military court-martial trials for BDR members who took part in the mutiny. Dozens of BDR officers, including the force's commander, were killed and their bodies left in sewers and shallow graves during the mutiny, which was sparked by grievances over pay and working conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The illegally captured data included hundreds of thousands of <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/01/113_79291.html">emails, instant messages, passwords and search histories</a> [<em>Korea Times</em> report] through unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The information was <a href="http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2930655">discovered on 79 hard disks</a> [<em>JoongAng Daily</em> report] seized from Google's Seoul office, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">police raided</a> [JURIST report] in August. According to police, the data was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jNe9WJm71x1dtzlRqH9BrMitdxXA?docId=N0003591294303461946A">captured in Seoul and three other major cities</a> [UKPA report] between October 2009 and May 2010 when Google announced that it had inadvertently collected fragments of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries. Google has apologized for the intrusion, indicating the data was mistakenly collected and promised to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gSyALlHOBHWVEKLijzy-XMQ1uVJA?docId=b3232d5388de41faa9b3acf697930046">continue cooperating with the investigation</a> [AP report]. Police acknowledged that 10 Google employees in South Korea and the US are being investigated, although each claimed they had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i-LxTgjqCHIdc-lqG7iazDsb6KaA?docId=CNG.de7188d6046cd1bfcd0dfd9fb5062a9e.681">no knowledge of what was collected</a> [AFP report]. The police indicated the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/06/google-streetview-south-korea">investigation would be concluded by the end of January</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], but it remains unclear whether Google will be prosecuted.

<p>South Korea is the latest country to find Google in breach of its privacy, but is the first to publicly announce the discovery of evidence. In November, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] announced that Google <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/pressreleases/2010/google_inc_street_view_press_release_03112010.ashx">committed a "significant breach"</a> [press release] of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] through its <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">data collection practices</a> [JURIST report] for its Street View maps. In October, Canadain <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.cfm">Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart</a> [official website] announced that Google was in violation of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF] (PIPEDA) when it <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">unintentionally captured personal information</a> [JURIST report] while taking pictures for its Google Street View feature. Also in October, The US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] announced that it <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into internal policies and procedures at Google that led to the company inadvertently collecting data on unsecured wireless networks while photographing streetscapes for its Street View maps program. Other countries, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports] have also launched their own investigations into the privacy breach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOD said it had successfully transferred Farhi after the inter-agency <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdf/GTMOtaskforcereport_052810.pdf">Guantanamo Review Task Force</a> [executive summary, PDF] approved the transfer following a comprehensive review considering, especially, the security issues. The DOD worked closely with the government of Algeria to transfer Farhi safely and securely. Farhi's lawyers had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/06/AR2011010605569.html">fought the transfer</a> [WP report] back to Algeria out of fear that he would be tortured and mistreated. It is unclear whether Farhi is currently in jail in Algeria.

<p>Last January, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/supreme-court-permits-guantanamo-detainees-return-to-algeria.php">declined</a> to review the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] of the lower court permitting the government to transfer Farhi to Algeria. The decision left in place a ruling of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], in which the government asserted that Fahri's return to Algeria was permissible because there was not credible evidence that he would face torture upon his arrival. In that ruling, Judge Gladys Kessler had directed the government to "take all necessary and appropriate steps to facilitate [Fahri's] release forthwith." The order resulted from a civil action brought against the US government for unlawfully detaining him since 2002.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09600SB3539ham001&GA=96&LegID=51489&SessionId=76&SpecSess=0&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=3539&GAID=10&Session=">amended bill</a> (SB3539) [amendment, text] <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-06/news/ct-met-illinois-house-death-penalty-v20110106_1_penalty-gordon-randy-steidl-historic-vote">passed the House 60-54</a> [Chicago Tribune report] just hours after it had failed by a single vote. It marks the first time the state legislature has voted to abolish the death penalty since former Governor George Ryan put a moratorium on it 10 years ago. Supporters of the bill expressed concern over the possibility of innocent people being executed especially after some people on death row have later been exonerated. Opponents argue, alternatively, that that the threat of the death penalty is an important tool for law enforcement officials.

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue worldwide. According to an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] the number of countries using the death penalty <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 but more than 700 people were executed in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the US. Last August,  <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] heard a <em>habeas</em> petition from Troy Davis who was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia, police officer. In a rare move, the federal court heard the <em>habeas</em> petition after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text], but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence. <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [official website] Executive Director Sarah Totonchi <a href="/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">argues</a> [JURIST commentary] that the "'Troy Davis' case illustrates that U.S. courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge David Hittner of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] heard testimony from three psychiatrists before concluding that Stanford's addiction to anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications prescribed by prison physicians has rendered him <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/stanford/7368790.html">unable to meaningfully contribute to his defense</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report].  Judge Hittner ordered representatives for each side to submit motions by Wednesday to determine whether Stanford should remain in custody or be released to a private facility for detoxification.

<p>Stanford is accused of <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/stanford/StanfordIndict.pdf">defrauding investors</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-indicted-in-7.php">report</a>] out of $7 billion.  Last January, a federal judge ordered that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-orders-return-of-gold.php"> $21.2 million in gold coins and bullion be returned</a> [JURIST report] to more than 200 of Stanford's investors.  Weeks earlier, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/doj-investigating-financier-stanford.php">began investigating</a> [JURIST report] political donations and other connections between Stanford and US lawmakers.  Stanford donated more than $2.3 million to lawmakers' campaigns and spent more than $5 million in lobbying efforts while allegedly carrying out the fraud.  Stanford has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him and was originally set to be released on $500,000 bail until prosecutors successfully appealed the decision.  Through three of his investment companies, Stanford allegedly violated the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/33Act.htm">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/34Act.htm">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/uscode15-80a-1.htm">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [texts].  He was originally <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20901.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">report</a>] in February with running a fraudulent investment scheme by selling certificates of deposit on the promise of improbably high interest rates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Magliocchetti was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/August/10-crm-899.html">indicted</a> [press release] in August and the following month pleaded guilty to charges of making illegal conduit and corporate contributions and making false statements. Between 2003 and 2008, Magliocchetti circumvented campaign finance regulations governing individual and corporate contributions by instructing friends, family and associates to make personal donations to specified candidates and reimbursing their expenses. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] contends that Magliocchetti funneled over &#36;1 million to campaigns and political action committees in this manner, though Magliocchetti's confession <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/07/AR2011010706331.html">admits to only $386,000</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. In addition to confinement, US District Judge T.S. Ellis III also sentenced Magliocchetti to two years supervised release and ordered him to pay a fine of $75,000.

<p>DOJ officials described Magliocchetti's collective activities as one of the largest campaign finance crimes in history, though stressed that the recipients were unaware of the funds' improper nature. Because of cases like Magliocchetti, pressure on politicians to be aware of where their campaign contributions come from has increased in recent years. In September 2009, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/dc-circuit-upholds-congressional.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s1enr.txt.pdf">Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007</a> (HLOGA) [text, PDF], a law <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/bush-signs-minimal-legislative-ethics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 that requires members of Congress to disclose more information about their fund-raising efforts and gifts they receive from lobbyists. The Obama administration has also tried to reduce the amount of contact between lobbyists and officials in the administration. In April 2009, leaders of several lobbying groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-lobbyist-groups-protest-restrictions.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the administration to eliminate or change restrictions it has put on contact that lobbyists can have with administration officials concerning <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.pdf">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx">official website</a>] projects. Earlier that month, JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/luneburgwv">William Luneburg</a> [faculty profile] <a href="/forumy/2009/04/obama-lobbying-directive-steps-in-right.php">criticized constitutional arguments</a> [JURIST op-ed] made by the lobbyist groups, arguing that the restrictions were needed to limit the disproportionate power of such groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

King <a href="http://steveking.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Newsroom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=5c5b18dd-19b9-b4b1-1244-1a7e3913786b&Region_id=&Issue_id">stated</a> [press release] that the bill is necessary to reduce the financial incentives for illegal immigration and curtail the 'birth tourism' industry.

The bill currently bears 26 co-sponsorships, though further action has not yet been scheduled.

<p>Senators <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/biography/">Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) and <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profiles] in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/senators-introduce-immigration-reform-bill.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2010, which incorporates several previously proposed bills.  Absent comprehensive reform at the federal level, illegal immigration continues to be a concern for local governments as well.  In September, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073531p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">report</a>] that two ordinances passed by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania making it more difficult for illegal immigrants to live or work in the town are unconstitutional.

Roll of the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] was shot and killed when a gunman <a href="http://pimasheriff.org/files/9212/9458/7973/Shooting_010811.pdf">opened fire</a> [press release] at a public constituent event held outside of a shopping center in Tucson on Saturday. The gunman additionally killed 5 others, including a 9-year-old girl, and wounded 20. Before serving in the Arizona District Court, Roll was a state judge and an assistant US attorney. Roll was named to the District Court in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush and became chief judge in 2006. In 2009, Roll received a series of <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/07/09/20090709threats0709.html">death threats</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] after presiding over <a href="http://www.maldef.org/immigration/litigation/vicente_v_barnett/">Vicente v. Barnett</a> [MALDEF backgrounder], a $32 million civil rights lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants, allowing it to move forward in the courts. In a rare <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/News/NewsView/11-01-08/Chief_Justice_s_Statement_on_Death_of_Judge_Roll.aspx">public statement</a> [press release], Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. condemned the shooting:<blockquote>The violence in Arizona today has senselessly taken five lives and inflicted tragic loss on dedicated public servants and their families. We in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own. Chief Judge John Roll was a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction, as attorney and judge, for more than 35 years. I express my deepest condolences to his wife Maureen and his children, as well as the other victims and their families. Chief Judge Roll's death is a somber reminder of the importance of the rule of law and the sacrifices of those who work to secure it.</blockquote>The <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/2011/01/us-rep-gabrielle-giffords-to-host-first-congress-on-your-corner-of-the-year-on-saturday.shtml">event</a> [press release] was hosted by <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [official website] who was also shot, sustaining severe head injuries, and remains in critical condition. Roll was not appearing with Giffords in his <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/01/09/20110109john-roll-gabrielle-giffords-arizona-shooting.html">official capacity</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report], but simply stopped by as a courtesy visit.

<p>President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/01/08/president-speaks-shootings-tucson-we-are-going-get-bottom-and-we-re-going-get-throug">directed</a> that the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/arizona_010811">investigation into the shooting be conducted</a> [press releases] by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), coordinated by Director Robert Mueller. Authorities have arrested suspect Jared Lee Loughner and are <a href="http://pimasheriff.org/files/9912/9456/4787/Attempt_to_Identify.pdf">searching for a possible accomplice</a> [press release]. Due to the currently polarized political climate, many suspect that the attack was <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/01/the-note-arizona-shooting-touches-off-fierce-debate-over-political-rhetoric.html">politically motivated</a> [ABC report].

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.6523:">Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act of 2011</a> [HR 6523] authorizes funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs. However, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr6523enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr6523enr.pdf">sections 1032 and 1033</a> [text, PDF] impose significant setbacks to the Obama administration's self-imposed <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php"">deadline</a> [JURIST report] for closing the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Specifically, section 1032 bars the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and section 1033 bars the use of funds to transfer detainees to the custody of foreign countries unless specified conditions are met. President Obama voiced his reluctance in signing the bill:<blockquote>The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is a powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation and must be among the options available to us.  Any attempt to deprive the executive branch of that tool undermines our Nation's counterterrorism efforts and has the potential to harm our national security...We must have the ability to act swiftly and to have broad flexibility in conducting our negotiations with foreign countries...Requiring the executive branch to certify to additional conditions would hinder the conduct of delicate negotiations with foreign countries and therefore the effort to conclude detainee transfers in accord with our national security...Despite my strong objection to these provisions, which my Administration has consistently opposed, I have signed this Act because of the importance of authorizing appropriations for, among other things, our military activities in 2011.</blockquote>The administration plans to seek the repeal of these restrictions and opposes the extension or expansion of them in the future.

<p>The Obama administration continues its push to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, despite running into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the suspension of detainee <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">US House Armed Services Committee </a>[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/house-committee-votes-not-to-fund-US-facility-for-Guantanamo-transfers.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/congressional_budget/pdfs/FY2011_pdfs/HASC_111-491.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011</a> [text, PDF] prohibiting the Obama administration from modifying or building a facility in the US to hold detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay. In November, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] defeated a measure which would have <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-defeats-amendment-to-block-funds.php">placed similar restrictions</a> [JURIST report] into the<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h3082eh.txt.pdf"> Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act</a> [text, PDF; HR 3082 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR03082:">materials</a>]. In June 2009, the US House <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/house-denies-guantanamo-closure-funds.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an Obama administration request for $60 million to fund the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, and required the president to submit a detailed plan to Congress documenting the costs and risks of transferring a detainee to the US for trial or detention at least two months before the detainee is to be transferred. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmassachusetts.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/index.html">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.universalhub.com/2011/us-bank-national-association-trustee-vs-antonio-ib">decision</a> [text, PDF] on Friday ruling against banks in two foreclosure cases that could have important implications on similar cases both inside and outside of the state. In the consolidated decision <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/justices/gants.html">Justice Ralph Gants</a> [official profile] ruled that neither US Bank National Association nor Wells Fargo, which were not the original mortgagees, failed to prove they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure. "As a result, they did not demonstrate that the foreclosure sales were valid to convey title to the subject properties, and their requests for a declaration of clear title were properly denied," he said. In both cases, the mortgages were <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-07/us-bancorp-wells-fargo-lose-pivotal-massachusetts-foreclosure-case.html">transferred to two mortgage-backed trusts</a> [Bloomberg report] without the recipients being named. As a result, Gants held: <blockquote>Because only a present holder of the mortgage is authorized to foreclose on the mortgaged property, and because the mortgagor is entitled to know who is foreclosing and selling the property, the failure to identify the holder of the mortgage in the notice of sale may render the notice defective and the foreclosure sale void.</blockquote>
Wells Fargo released a <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/press/2011/20110107_Mass">statement</a> [text] in response to the judgment: <blockquote>As trustee of a securitized pool of loans, Wells Fargo expects the entities who service these loans to abide by all applicable state laws, including those laws that govern foreclosure sales. Wells Fargo believes the court's ruling does not prevent foreclosures on loans in securitizations. The court simply set forth a standard legal process that mortgage servicers must follow in Massachusetts.</blockquote> 
Bank stocks <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/bank-stocks-slump-on-foreclosure-ruling/">fell significantly</a> [NYT report] after the Massachusetts court issued its ruling, due to concerns that based on this ruling numerous foreclosures carried out over the past several years could be deemed invalid. 

<p>Foreclosure practices have come under close scrutiny is recent months. In mid-December Arizona Attorney General <a href="http://www.azag.gov/meet_the_ag.html">Terry Goddard</a> [official profile] filed a <a href="http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/dec/2010/Press%20Release%20-%20Bank%20of%20America.html">lawsuit</a> [press release] against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website] for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/arizona-ag-sues-bank-of-america-for-mortgage-fraud.php">misleading customers</a> [JURIST report] in mortgage modification and foreclosure practices. In November Chief Justice <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/justices/canady.shtml">Charles Canady</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/index.html">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-11-17-CanadyLetter.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] to the chief judges of Florida's 20 judicial circuits directing them to ensure that all foreclosure proceedings in the state are <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/florida-supreme-court-requiring-all-foreclosure-proceedings-to-be-public.php">open to the public</a> [JURIST report].  In October, New York Chief Judge <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/appeals/chjjl.htm">Jonathan Lippman</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/pdfs/AdminOrder_2010_10_20.pdf">announced</a> [statement, PDF] a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/new-york-courts-requiring-lawyers-to-confirm-accuracy-of-foreclosure-paperwork.php">new court rule</a> [JURIST report] that requires lawyers to <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/attorneys/foreclosures/Affirmation-Foreclosure.pdf">file a separate affirmation</a> [form, PDF] confirming the accuracy of paperwork used in residential foreclosure cases. Lippman explained that the new rule was an effort to provide <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/press/pr2010_12.shtml">better protection</a> [press release] to people facing the possibility of losing their home, particularly in response to the recent discoveries of errors in foreclosure documents nationwide. Also in October, attorneys general from all 50 states and the District of Columbia <a href="http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/oct_2010/Foreclosure_Affidavit_joint_stmt.pdf">announced</a> [joint statement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/state-ags-to-investigate-foreclosure-practices.php">report</a>] that they have formed a bipartisan group called the Mortgage Foreclosure Multistate Group (MFMG), which will investigate allegations of procedural defects committed by mortgage loan companies during foreclosure processes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights-racial-justice/friendly-house-et-al-v-whiting-et-al-plaintiffs-motion-preliminar-0">petition</a> [text, PDF]: <blockquote>The First Amendment guarantees all members of society the right to free expression. Solicitation speech is expression entitled to full protection under the First Amendment. Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) of the Arizona Revised Statutes are content-based speech restrictions because they impose statewide criminal liability on motorists and individuals based on individuals' employment solicitation speech.</blockquote> Other key provisions of the legislation were blocked through a <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ic/pdf/0729sb1070-bolton-ruling.pdf">preliminary junction order</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] by the Arizona district court in July. Speaking about petition filed on Friday, legal director and general counsel for the NDLON Chris Newman said, "Free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment are vital to our democracy, and they belong as much to day laborers as they do to authors, corporations, and politicians. Other federal judges that have examined similar anti-day labor laws have found them to be unconstitutional, and we are confident these sections of SB 1070 will be enjoined and ultimately struck down as well."

<p>In December, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-08-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>]  in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-115.pdf">Chamber of Commerce v.

According to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1324(a)(h)(2)</a> [text], federal law preempts any "[s]tate or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens," except in cases of state licensing laws.

Loughner has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jared-loughner-alleged-tucson-shooting-gunman-appears-court/story?id=12580344">invoked his right to remain silent</a> [ABC report] and refuses to talk to investigators. It is expected that Loughner will be <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2011/01/10/20110110gabrielle-giffords-arizona-shooting-legal.html">represented in court</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] by well-known federal public defender Judy Clarke, who has assisted other high-profile defendants including the "Unabomber" Theodore Kaczynski and Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman who drowned her children in 1994. 

<p>President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/01/08/president-speaks-shootings-tucson-we-are-going-get-bottom-and-we-re-going-get-throug">directed</a> that the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/arizona_010811">investigation into the shooting be conducted</a> [press releases] by the FBI, coordinated by Mueller. Authorities arrested Loughner on Saturday and are <a href="http://pimasheriff.org/files/9912/9456/4787/Attempt_to_Identify.pdf">searching for a possible accomplice</a> [press release]. Due to the currently polarized political climate, many suspect that the attack was <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/01/the-note-arizona-shooting-touches-off-fierce-debate-over-political-rhetoric.html">politically motivated</a> [ABC report]. Giffords received harsh criticism in Arizona for her vote for the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Health+Care">news archive</a>] and was among those members of Congress who reported threats or vandalism in 2010. Giffords also was an outspoken critic of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Ultimately, a clear motive into the shootings has yet to be identified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The laws envisage the death penalty for anyone who insults the Prophet Muhammad and have been widely criticized. Gilani made his statement on the same day as <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Punjab-governor-killing-Thousands-march-in-Karachi-to-support-blasphemy-laws-Qadri-/articleshow/7249179.cms">thousands protested in Karachi</a> [TOI report] against amending the laws. Taseer, a senior member of the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a> (PPP) [party website], was shot by one of his security guards while getting into his car at Islamabad's Kohsar Market and died later at a hospital. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the guard immediately surrendered to police and confessed to shooting Taseer because he had spoken against the blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an argument with other women in her village last year. Tasseer had spoken in Bibi's defense. 

<p>Pakistan's blasphemy laws were introduced in 1986 as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults. In response to repeated calls for repeal, Pakistani Federal Minister for Minority Affairs <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Mom/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNLE_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIo_LBEMTfT-P_NxU_YLs7DRHR0VFAGW7A9Q%21/dl2/d1/L0lDU0lKSWdrbUEhIS9JRFJBQUlpQ2dBek15cXchL1lCSkoxTkExTkk1MC01RncvN19VRkpQQ0dDMjBPVVFFMDJFVDlGTVBKMzBPMC9Ga19fXzE3/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_UFJPCGC20OUQE02ET9FMPJ30O0_WCM&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MomCL/ministry/about/minister">Shahbaz Bhatti</a> [official profile] has said the laws may be amended to prevent misuse, but they will not be repealed. Advocacy groups such as <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hrw-urges-repeal-of-pakistan-blasphemy-laws.php">Human Rights Watch</a> [JURIST report], as well as LHC advocate <a href="/forum/2010/11/no-space-for-democracy-and-rule-of-law-blasphemy-laws-in-pakistan.php">Saroop Ijaz</a> [JURIST op-ed] have called for the laws to be repealed.

Bhatti made the comments at an interview with the AFP in Washington, DC, where he met with various lawmakers and officials during the National Prayer Breakfast. Bhatti discussed a proposed change in the law that would force judges to investigate blasphemy cases before they are docketed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Oneida Indian Nation</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Pet.10-72.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, ordering the lower court to reconsider its ruling. The Second Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10909961002021652018">ruling</a> [opinion text] had found that tribal sovereign immunity prevented county authorities from foreclosing on property belonging to the <a href="http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/">Oneida Indian Nation</a> [official website]. Authorities in Madison and Oneida counties in New York had sought the foreclosures due to the failure of the tribe to pay county taxes. The Supreme Court decided to remand the case after the Oneida Indian Nation passed an ordinance in November waiving "its sovereign immunity to enforcement of real property taxation through foreclosure by state, county and local governments within and throughout the United States." Upon remand, the Supreme Court ordered the Second Circuit to rule in the first instance on whether the ordinance should change the court's earlier decision.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-to-2010-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> in the case</a> [JURIST report] in October to determine whether tribal sovereign immunity from suit bars taxing authorities from foreclosing to collect lawfully imposed property taxes and whether the ancient Oneida reservation in New York was disestablished or diminished. The case was the most recent in a series of disputes between the Oneida Indian Nation and New York state authorities over the question of state and local taxes. The Supreme Court had previously <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15926282018498825263&hl=en&as_sdt=800000000002">ruled against</a> [opinion text] the tribe's claims of immunity over tribal lands that were sold in the nineteenth century and repurchased by the tribe within the previous decade.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [Guardian report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. The remaining five years of her sentence result from allegations that she was a member of the <a href="http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Human Rights Defenders Center</a> [advocacy website], an organization originally founded by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shirin+Ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a> [JURIST news archive] and four other Iranian lawyers, many of whom have also been detained or otherwise punished for their work. In addition to her prison term, Sotoudeh's punishment also requires that she refrain from leaving the country or practicing law for the next 20 years. Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-detained.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] in September and spent much of that time in solitary confinement. She is most widely known for representing political activists following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">controversial 2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Sotoudeh has worked on several high-profile cases. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of <em>mohareb</em>, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Sotoudeh also represented <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile], a well-known press activist who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-court-sentences-outspoken-editor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to four years in prison in 2006 for publishing articles against the constitution and offending the state media. Iran continues to be scrutinized internationally for human rights violations. In March, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] criticized the state of human rights in Iran while presenting her annual report. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-chief-criticizes-iran-sri.php">condemned</a>[JURIST report] Iran for the "arbitrary arrest" of, and "harsh sentences, including capital punishment" given to, individuals involved in protests following the presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Siracusano</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>] on a pharmaceutical company's obligation under &#167;10(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act</a> and <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule10b-5.html">SEC Rule 10b-5</a> [texts] to disclose reports of patients' adverse reactions when the number of incidents is statistically insignificant. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/28/06-15677.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the inference that Matrixx withheld reports of patients' adverse reactions intentionally or with deliberate recklessness was as compelling as if they withheld the information innocently, and therefore the plaintiff had met the scienter pleading requirement of Rule 10b-5. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the reports do not establish any reliable facts about the drug, and that a duty to report these results would unfairly affect the company: <blockquote>A securities fraud claim requires both materiality and scienter, and neither of those is established unless the company has knowledge of facts establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the drug itself is the cause of the reported event. Absent information like that, there is neither materiality nor scienter under the securities laws, until there's reliable evidence of a causal link between the product and the event...We have to be very careful about creating a rule through our interpretation of materiality that would require companies in advance to disclose the fact that a baseless, false allegation about the company is going to come out.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that there is an analytical distinction between the importance of information and the intent to deceive. "The information might be important for investors, but it could very well be that the people making the disclosures don't have the requisite scienter because there is an absence of any plausible relationship." The respondent further noted that materiality is determined by the totality of the information available to investors.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/137,%20Orig.pdf">Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/montana-files-water-rights-lawsuit.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether Wyoming officials breached an agreement between the states by failing to keep consumption of water from the Tongue and Powder rivers within the agreement's limits. Montana and North Dakota contend that Wyoming violated the <a href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/support.docs/YellowstoneRiverCompact.doc">Yellowstone River Compact</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/YRCC%20-%20Compact%20and%20Commission%20Information.htm">materials</a>], which allocates water rights to the two tributaries of the Yellowstone River, by allowing the construction of water storage facilities and the expansion of irrigation. In 2008, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/102008zor.pdf">appointed</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-appoints-special-master.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Special_master">special master</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to investigate and oversee the lawsuit, which was filed directly in the Supreme Court as it has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html">original jurisdiction</a> [Article III, Section 2 text] and <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001251----000-.html">exclusive jurisdiction</a> [28 USC 1251 text] over cases in which a state is a party. Counsel for Montana argued that:<blockquote>First, the plain language of the compact preserves the water supply each State was receiving as of 1950. Second, contrary to the compact's purposes, the master's interpretation would allow individual water users to alter those amounts. And third, the master's policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to the principles underlying a century of western water law.</blockquote>Counsel for Wyoming argued that the state has a classic water right to divert water for the purpose of irrigation, as "the irrigation right is a general right."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision invalidates a proposed amendment to Saskatchewan's <a href="http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/M4-1.pdf">Marriage Act of 1995</a> [text; PDF] that would  allow for marriage commissioners to refuse to solemnize same-sex marriages in service to their of religious beliefs and would exclude the participation of commissioners in office before Parliament legalized same-sex marriage in 2005. The court expressed that its opinion protects the rights of gay and lesbian couples :
<blockquote>[The amendment], if enacted, will create situations where a same-sex couple contacting a marriage commissioner for the purpose of getting married will be told by the commissioner that he or she will not provide the service requested. This is not a merely theoretical concern. ... Both the Grandfathering Option and the Comprehensive Option will have the effect of drawing a distinction based on sexual orientation. ... Gay and lesbian individuals will be treated differently than other people who wish to be married. The differential treatment will be negative and will flow directly from their sexual orientation.</blockquote>
Furthermore, the court noted that because most other marriage officials are of religious backgrounds and do not condone same-sex unions, allowing marriage commissioners to refuse to marry same-sex couples would destroy all opportunities for gay and lesbian couples to have access to the institution of marriage. 

<p>Since <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-canada-passes-same-sex.php">Canada legalized the marriage of same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report] in 2005, the issue has been the topic of popular debate. Despite resistance to the law, in 2006,  <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/canada-lawmakers-vote-down-revisiting.php">Canadian law makers refused</a> [JURIST report] to reconsider the decision, calling the matter settled. In 2004, a Saskatchewan court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2004/11/breaking-news-saskatchewan-court.php">found </a> [JURIST report] that a federal prohibition on same-sex marriages was unconstitutional, making such marriages legal in the province. In 2005, Canada was only the fourth country to recognize same-sex marriage.  There are now more than ten countries that recognize same-sex marriages. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1403.htm">Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co.</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/09-1403_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether investor losses need to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence at the class certification stage prior to full discovery in order for the class action lawsuit to proceed.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-11195-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that this was procedurally proper.  The Fifth Circuit also determined that a plaintiff must establish loss causation to invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption laid out in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5589356734421689123&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Basic v. Levinson</a> [opinion].  

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-209.htm">Lafler v. Cooper</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Lafler.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-444.htm">Missouri v. Frye</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/12-10-Frye-Petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine how poor legal advice between attorneys and clients regarding plea bargaining should impact subsequent guilty verdicts.  In Lafler v. Cooper, Anthony Cooper was convicted of assault with intent to murder for shooting a woman in her thigh and buttocks after his attorney advised him to not take a plea offer in the belief that there could be no finding of the requisite intent.  The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0281n-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the attorneys advice was unconstitutional as it amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.  In Missouri v. Frye, Galin Frye was offered two deals by prosecutors during proceedings for driving with a revoked license, but Frye's attorney never informed his client about the offers and Frye pleaded guilty.  The Missouri Court of Appeals held that the attorney's failure to inform his client about the plea offers amounted to unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-382.htm">United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brief-10-07-10-090130.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether attorney-client privilege allows for the United States to deny discovery requests for communications between the United States and its attorneys when those communications concern management of an Indian trust and there was no claim of a specific competing interest.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-M908.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the privilege did not apply and upheld the lower court's order of production.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-568.htm">Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/01-07-Nevada-Petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether the First Amendment allows states to prevent government officials from voting on matters in which they have or appear to have a personal conflict.  The Nevada Supreme Court, citing <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/citizens-opinion.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF], <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/01-07-Nevada-Commission-opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that preventing an official from casting such a vote violated the First Amendment because voting by an elected public officer on public issues is protected speech.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-779.htm">Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Pet.10-779.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether state laws restricting or preventing the sale of nonpublic prescription data to drug companies for marketing purposes without the prescriber's consent is a violation of First Amendment commercial speech.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, also citing Citzens United, <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9ca25622-5b69-45b1-a410-a1ce46eaea5c/1/doc/09-1913_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9ca25622-5b69-45b1-a410-a1ce46eaea5c/1/hilite/">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the law was an unconstitutional regulation of commercial speech.</p>

<p>Lastly, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-5258.htm">McNeill v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/McNeill-Cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine how retroactive sentencing laws affect the definition of a "serious drug offense" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000924----000-.html">Armed Career Criminal Act </a>(ACCA) [18 U.S.C. section 924].  Clifton McNeill was arrested in 2007 after police discovered a firearm and 3.1 grams of cocaine during a search incident to arrest for eluding a traffic stop.  In light of previous drug convictions in 1992 and 1995, McNeill was convicted under the ACCA.  The previous convictions and sentencing structure met the definitions of a "serious drug offense" at the time they were committed, however, the statutory sentences for those offenses were reduced in later years and do not currently meet the ACCA definition.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/McNeill-v.-US-4th-Cir.-Opinion.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ACCA still applied regardless of the subsequent statutory changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an interview published by the Lebanese Newspaper <a href="http://www.annahar.com/index.php?type=main&table=main&day=Sat">An-Nahar</a> [official website], Clinton reiterated US support for Lebanon and noted that the work of the STL is "legitimate and necessary." She also stressed the independence of the tribunal and that "no one knows what the Special Tribunal is going to do, who it might indict, or when it might choose to move forward." Clinton's interview followed remarks made by Hezbollah leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile], who said he would "cut off the hands" of any person attempting to arrest a Hezbollah member in connection with the murder.

In the press release, issued on the eve of the facility's <a href="/thisday/2011/01/11/first-detainees-arrived-at-guantanamo-bay.php">ninth anniversary in operation</a> [JURIST This Day at Law report], HRW recommended that Obama should escalate efforts to prosecute Guantanamo detainees in federal court or return and resettle them in order to meet US obligations under international law. The rights organization recognized Obama's commitment in closing the facility, but cited the continued practices of indefinite detention, use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] instead of federal courts, insufficient efforts to repatriate or resettle detainees and not acting forcefully enough to overcome obstacles from Congress as failures of the administration. HRW argued:<blockquote>Closing Guantanamo is as essential today as it was when President Obama took office in 2009. But Obama can't keep hoping that a political consensus will form and Congress will make it easy - he has to act to make it happen. Obama still has the authority he needs to bring Guantanamo detainees to justice in US courts or to send them home. If he truly believes that Guantanamo is a scar on America's reputation, he should assert his authority now.</blockquote>The press release went to outline the actions and policies already taken by the Obama administration to close Guantanamo but noted that they had not been fully carried out. These included the missed <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">January 2010 deadline</a> to close the facility,  failed efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/house-committee-votes-not-to-fund-US-facility-for-Guantanamo-transfers.php">relocate detainees to a prison in Illinois</a>, the continued use of military commissions to try detainees and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ex-guantanamo-detainee-acquitted-on-all-but-one-charge.php">limited use of federal courts</a> [JURIST reports] despite a stated preference for them.

<p>As noted by HRW, Obama's efforts to close Guantanamo have faced ongoing opposition from Congress. On Friday, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">signed a bill barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the US for trial. The legislation authorized funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs and barred the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and limited funds available for transfers to foreign countries. The administration plans to seek the repeal of these restrictions and opposes the extension or expansion of them in the future. In June 2009, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/house-denies-guantanamo-closure-funds.php">denied an Obama administration request for $60 million</a> [JURIST report] to fund the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, and required the president to submit a detailed plan to Congress documenting the costs and risks of transferring a detainee to the US for trial or detention at least two months before the detainee is to be transferred. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].

Judge Pat Priest <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/10/AR2011011000557.html">sentenced DeLay to prison</a> [WP report] on the conspiracy charge and gave DeLay probation in lieu of a five-year prison sentence for money laundering.  The charges stemmed from $190,000 donated by corporate interests to DeLay's political action committee (PAC) during the 2002 midterm election, which was allegedly funneled through the <a href="http://www.gop.com/">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC) [party website] for use in state elections. The RNC then distributed the money to seven legislative candidates at DeLay's direction in order to circumvent a <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/txstatutes/EL/15/253/D/253.094">state election law</a> [Tex. Elec. Code &#167; 253.094] forbidding corporate contributions to political campaigns, according to prosecutors. DeLay, who denies wrongdoing and claims his prosecution was politically motivated, secured his release by posting a $10,000 bond and <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/delay-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison-freed-1176890.html">plans to appeal</a> [<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> report] his conviction.

<p>In August, DeLay's lawyer confirmed that a US Department of Justice (DOJ) criminal probe into DeLay's association with lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive] had been dismissed <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/doj-ends-delay-criminal-probe-without-filing-charges.php">without charges being filed</a> [JURIST report]. The investigation lasted six years and included grand jury testimony from former aides as well as a review of more than 1,000 documents and e-mails from DeLay's office. In August 2008, a Texas appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-appellate-court-refuses-to.php">allowed the money laundering indictment</a> [JURIST report] against DeLay's associates to stand. In 2007, a Texas appeals court ruled against reinstating a charge of conspiracy to violate the state's election law against DeLay and his two associates. After he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/breaking-news-delay-indicted-for-money.php">indicted</a>, DeLay <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/delay-steps-down-as-house-majority.php">stepped down as House majority leader</a> and later <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/delay-to-resign-from-congress-as-legal.php">resigned from Congress</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

FIA Card Services, N.A.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that debtors who apply for Chapter 13 bankruptcy cannot use a car payment as a deduction from their repayment plan if the debtor has paid off the automobile. The opinion was the first authored by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kagan">Justice Elena Kagan</a> [JURIST news archive], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kagan-sworn-in-as-supreme-court-justice.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] the court in August after serving as solicitor general in the Obama administration and as Dean of Harvard Law School. The case dealt with Chapter 13 bankruptcy under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/11/usc_sec_11_00001301----000-.html">11 USC &#167; 1301</a> [text] where a debtor repays creditors according to a court-approved plan. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/11/usc_sec_11_00000707----000-.html">US bankruptcy code</a> [11 USC &#167; 707(b)(2)] uses a statutory formula called the "means test" which allows debtors deduct "applicable" monthly expenses from their monthly income to determine a disposable income to repay creditors. The debtor in this case, Jason Ransom, had attempted to mark as a deduction the maximum amount allowed for car payments for a car that he owned outright. In the opinion of the court, Kagan interpreted the term "applicable" in the bankruptcy code to mean a deduction is allowed "only if that deduction is appropriate for him" preventing Ransom from marking the car as a deduction since he was no longer making payments on it. 

<p>The court's opinion upholds the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/08/14/08-15066.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the bankruptcy court may not allow such deductions. The Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-907.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-hear-copyright.php">report</a>] in October. Counsel for Ransom argued that, "[i]n 2005 when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act, it made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and necessary expenses." Counsel for the respondent argued that, "[t]he Bankruptcy Code precludes an above-median income debtor like Petitioner from shielding from his creditors $471 a month for a car payment that he does not have." The US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the respondent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The advocacy group <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/10/10-56634_opposition.pdf">filed a response</a> [text, PDF] to a motion to delay that was recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-administration-seeks-to-delay-dont-ask-dont-tell-appeal.php">filed by the Obama Administration</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000492">US v. Log Cabin Republicans</a> [case materials]. In its response, the group argues that the court "should reject the government's constant attempts at delaying and avoiding the issues" and calls the motion "another effort by the government to avoid filing a brief attempting to defend the indefensible."  Log Cabin Republicans Executive Director R. Clarke Cooper said that the government would like the case to <a href="http://www.logcabin.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=nsKSL7PMLpF&b=6420733&ct=9004593">simply disappear</a> [press release]: <blockquote>The Obama administration&#8217;s continued defense of this failed and unconstitutional policy is a mystery. &#8216;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell,&#8217; was rejected by Congress, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and most notably by the American people. It is time for the President to stand by his commitment and end this policy of discrimination, removing the threat and specter of discharge from thousands of patriotic servicemembers.</blockquote>
The group said that it would have been willing to agreed to a delay in the proceedings if the government, in return, agreed to stop investigations and discharges during that period, but that gay servicemembers continue to be dissuaded from making their sexuality known.

<p>The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in December. However, DADT remains in effect until the president, secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify that the necessary policies and procedures are in place within the military to implement the repeal. After receiving certification, the full repeal must take effect within 60 days. The Obama administration had been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Earlier in December, three former service members discharged under DADT filed a complaint against the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-file-suit-seeking-reinstatement.php">seeking reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] and the declaration that their discharges under the statute, and the statute itself, are unconstitutional. Additionally, in November, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that medical residents are not classified as students for the purpose of federal tax exemption. The <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/">Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</a> [official website] had sought to exempt stipends paid to doctors during the residency portion of their medical training from the taxes on wages for employees required by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_C_20_21.html">Federal Insurance Contributions Act</a> (FICA) [text]. The US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> [official website] argued that the Social Security Act does not treat medical residents as students, and therefore they should not be eligible for tax exemptions under FICA. The court found that the government's interpretation of the two statues was reasonable: <blockquote>We do not doubt that Mayo's residents are engaged in a valuable educational pursuit or that they are students of their craft. The question whether they are "students" for purposes of [FICA] &#167; 3121, however, is a different matter. Because it is one to which Congress has not directly spoken, and because the Treasury Department's rule is a reasonable construction of what Congress has said, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. </blockquote> The case was decided by a unanimous ruling in which Justice Kagan took no part, as she was the US Solicitor General during parts of the case's history.

<p> Medical students working for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, receive stipends from the foundation and the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.php">University of Minnesota</a> [academic website] for the medical and patient care services they provide. The district court ruled that residents qualify for the exemption and ordered the US Treasury Department to refund FICA taxes paid during the second quarter of 2005 to both Mayo and the university. The US government appealed the district court's ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit. The circuit court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/09-837_ca8.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the lower court's holding, concluding that the judiciary must "defer to the regulation limiting this exception to students who are not full-time employees because it is a permissible interpretation of the statute."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its assessment of the government's <a href = "http://english.gov.cn/official/2009-04/13/content_1284128.htm">National Human Rights Action Plan of China</a> (NHRAP) [text], HRW decried China's continued use of torture, illegal detentions, and the government's overuse of the death penalty. HRW also noted China's lack of commitment in cooperating with the international human rights community, as well as a number of human rights issues not slated for improvement in the NHRAP. The rights group did praise China for working to eradicate poverty, although conceded that further steps should be made.<blockquote>At the same time as the Chinese government has pointed to the NHRAP as evidence of its commitment to human rights, the government has systematically continued to violate many of the most basic rights the document addresses. It has taken unambiguous steps to restrict rights to expression, association, and assembly. It has sentenced high&#8211;profile dissidents to lengthy prison terms on spurious state secrets or 'subversion' charges, expanded restrictions on media and internet freedom as well as tightened controls on lawyers, human rights defenders, and nongovernmental organizations. It has broadened controls on Uighurs and Tibetans, and engaged in increasing numbers of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions, including in secret, unlawful detention facilities known as 'black jails.'</blockquote> The report also cited China's reaction to Nobel peace prize winner <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>] as a prominent concern. In a <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201009/t769411.htm">position paper</a> [press release] published in September 2010, the Chinese government <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/china-government-cites-human-rights-improvements.php">claimed to have increased human rights</a> [JURIST report] by heightening Internet freedoms and improving civil and political rights.

<p>China has had a well&#8211;known struggle with international criticism of its <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=China+Human+Rights">human rights record</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April 2009, the <a href = "http://www.china.org.cn/">Information Office of the State Council</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/04/china-issues-first-human-rights.php">published the NHRAP</a> [JURIST report], which aimed to protect ethnic minorities, promote gender equality, guarantee suspects the right to an impartial trial, and prohibit illegal detentions and the use of torture to extract confessions from suspects. China also sought to provide basic nationwide health care, slow its greenhouse-gas emissions, and protect "normal religious activities." In February 2009, the Chinese delegation to the <A href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/02/china-defends-rights-record-in-review.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] China's human rights record while presenting a <a href ="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_CHN_1_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in compliance with the <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">UNHRC's Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website] process.

The lawsuit challenged the break-up of MBIA into two separate lines of bond insurance.  MBIA, historically the largest guarantee insurer of municipal bonds and other public entity securities, sought to separate its municipal bond obligations from its structured finance obligations, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.  Major financial institutions including <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com">JPMorgan Chase</a>, <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup</a>, <a href="http://www.bofa.com">Bank of America</a>, <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com">Morgan Stanley</a>, <a href="http://www.ml.com">Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="http://group.barclays.com">Barclays</a>, <a href="http://www.wachovia.com">Wachovia</a>, <a href="http://www.ubs.com">UBS</a>, and <a href="http://www.hsbc.com">HSBC</a> [corporate websites] challenged the split on the contractual grounds, arguing that it amounted to a fraudulent conveyance and left the divided MBIA undercapitalized and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41022401">unable to pay on the structured-finance product policies</a> [CNBC report] written by MBIA.  The court dismissed the lawsuit, concluding:<blockquote>For their breach of contract claim, plaintiffs allege that MBIA Insurance breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its insurance policies. Plaintiffs do not claim that MBIA Insurance has failed to make any payment due under the policies, but instead contend that the company has frustrated an implicit purpose of obtaining the policies, namely "to enhance the value and credit rating" of the covered structured finance products. However, since this alleged purpose is nowhere reflected in the policies, it cannot serve as the basis for a claim of breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. ... In effect, plaintiffs seek an advisory opinion premised on future events that are beyond defendants' control and thus are speculative.</blockquote>There are currently two other lawsuits challenging the split that have yet to be resolved.

<p>Financial institutions, as well as both private and municipal issuers, have recently faced securities-related enforcement actions. In August, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/33-9135.pdf">charged</a> [order, PDF] the state of New Jersey with securities fraud for failing to disclose to municipal bond investors that it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sec-charges-new-jersey-with-securities-fraud.php">underfunding two of the state's largest pension plans</a> [JURIST report].  Also in August, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rejects-sec-citigroup-subprime-mortgage-settlement.php">federal judge rejected a $75 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] reached between Citigroup and the SEC to resolve <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/sec-citigroup-settle-for-75-million.php">charges of misleading investors</a> [JURIST report] about Citigroup's exposure to sub-prime mortgage-related assets.  In July, <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co.</a>. [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goldman+sachs">news archive</a>] agreed to a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/consent-pr2010-123.pdf">$550 million settlement</a> [text, PDF] with the SEC to <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-123.htm">resolve charges</a> [press release] that they marketed a subprime mortgage product and made misleading statements and omissions to investors in early 2007. </p>]]></content:encoded>

McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] on the ability of a state, under the Fourteenth Amendment's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a foreign company that targets the US market and sells its product in the US. The case involves an accident where machinery manufactured by a British company and sold in the US by an unaffiliated distributor injured a man in New Jersey. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">Supreme Court of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/courts/supreme/a-29-08.opn.html">held</a> [opinion, text] last year that a foreign manufacturer that targets the US market for sales of its product may be subject to specific personal jurisdiction in state court if the injury in a products-liability case occurs in that state. Counsel for the petitioner argued that New Jersey lacked personal jurisdiction over the company because the company "did not direct any activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the action that it did toward New Jersey." Counsel for the respondents argued that since the British company purposely availed itself of the entire US market, which included New Jersey, then the company is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in New Jersey. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-76.pdf">Goodyear v. Brown</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_calendars/MonthlyArgumentCalJanuary2011.pdf">arguments</a>  [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/jan2011.shtml">merit briefs</a>] on whether a company is subject to a state's general personal jurisdiction in a products-liability case if it does not have any connections to the state, but where foreign subsidiaries introduced the product to the forum. The case involves the death of two North Carolina youths in France when a tire made in Turkey failed and the bus in which they were riding crashed. The <a href="http://www.nccourts.org/courts/appellate/appeal/">North Carolina Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/2009/pdf/080944-1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction. Counsel for the petitioner argued that finding the foreign company subject to a lawsuit in North Carolina would have widespread consequences for other companies: <blockquote>Under this Court's cases, the mere sale of a defendant's products in a State does not permit the State to reach out to assert judicial power over all that defendant's worldwide conduct. If that were permissible, every significant seller of products would be subject to suit everywhere on any claim arising anywhere.</blockquote> Counsel for the respondent argued that the "interdependent relationship" between Goodyear and the foreign companies created a connection to North Carolina based on "continuous and systematic contacts."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/">National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</a>[official website] released its <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report">full final report </a> [text] on Tuesday, tracing the deeper root causes of the spill and recommending steps to avoid future incidents. The report highlights mistakes made by <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum </a>(BP), as well as its partners <a href="http://www.halliburton.com">Haliburton</a> and <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean</a> [corporate websites], as the starting point that allowed the spill to take place, and finishes with recommendations based on those oversights. The recommendations include instituting fees for off-shore drilling leases that would help to fund a safety agency within the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] for the regulation of off-shore drilling. In addition, the commission advises the creation of a safety institute lead by the oil industry that can more closely regulate those practices. The commissioners conceded that they can not prevent another oil spill from occurring,  "but when exploration occurs, particularly in sensitive environments like the Gulf of Mexico or the Arctic, the country has an obligation to make responsible decisions regarding the benefits and risks". Several law-makers have stated that they will commence legislation based on these recommendations. Halliburton has <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110111006951/en/Halliburton-Comments-Final-Report-National-Commission-BP">rejected</a> [press release] the report's findings, saying that the commission had "selectively omitted information provided to it" by the company and had relied on false assumptions about cement testing.

<p>The report comes as another count against BP's practices leading up to the spill. In December, The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/doj-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday against units of (BP) and several other companies over the April <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">Deepwater Horizon oil spil</a>l [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>]. The government's lawsuit is one of hundreds filed against BP and other companies in connection with the oil spill. In August, the <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/index.html">US Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation</a> [official website] selected <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2808&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Judge Carl Barbier</a> [FJC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/louisiana-district-judge-to-preside-over-oil-spill-lawsuits.php">to hear</a> [JURIST report] more than 300 such lawsuits. Also that month, BP and the DOJ announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">completion of negotiations</a> over the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-to-set-aside-20-million-in-escrow-to-pay-oil-spill-damage-claims.php">implementation of a $20 billion fund</a> [JURIST reports] to aid victims of the oil spill. The report recommends that 80% of these funds collected go to restoration efforts in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The move comes after Reverend Fred Phelps's <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [WARNING: readers may find material at this church website offensive; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=westboro">news archive</a>] announced plans to picket the funeral of Christina Green, a 9-year-old girl killed Saturday in the shooting that injured <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Representative Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) and killed federal judge John Roll. The law makes it a misdemeanor "to cause picketing or other protest activities to occur within three hundred feet of the property line of any residence, cemetery, funeral home, church, synagogue, or other establishment during or within one hour before or one hour after the conducting of a burial or funeral service at that place." The bill, which received unanimous support from both houses of the Arizona legislature, imposes up to six months in prison for violators and fines of up to $2,500. A spokesperson for Westboro Baptist Church said the group <a href="http://www.azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/article_8933424a-1062-594f-81b6-38b385d1c5ea.html">plans to protest the funeral despite the new law</a> [<em>Arizona Daily Sun</em> report] and that she does not believe the law will affect the group since its members do not plan to enter the three-hundred-foot boundary. As emergency legislation, the law took immediate effect upon Brewer's signing.

<p>On Monday, federal prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">charged Jared Loughner</a> [criminal complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">report</a>] with murder and attempted murder for his role in Saturday's attack. The Westboro Baptist church has faced ongoing legislation and litigation over its practice of picketing high-profile and military funerals. In October, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-military-funeral-protests.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/snyder-v-phelps/">Snyder v. Phelps</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] regarding the extent to which the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] protects picketing at funerals. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that such activity is protected speech, overturning a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-jury-orders-military-funeral.php">lower court judgment</a> [JURIST report] awarding almost $11 million to the family of a Marine that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-lawsuit-filed-against-military.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] after Phelps and his church picketed the Marine's funeral.

The judge rejected Razak Ali's claim of mistaken identity and ruled that US officials acted on sufficient credible evidence of his association with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] operative Abu Zubaydah when detaining him in March 2002.  In his ruling, US District Judge Richard Leon cited:<blockquote>...[the] obvious and common-sense inference that a terrorist leader like Abu Zubaydah would not tolerate an unknown and untrusted stranger to dwell in a modest, two-story guesthouse for two weeks with himself and ten or so of his senior leadership, while they are preparing for their next operation against US and Allied forces...</blockquote>Considering the circumstances in addition to available supporting evidence, Leon concluded that Razak Ali "more likely than not" worked in conjunction with Abu Zubaydah.

<p>The district court has ruled in favor of the government in 20 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+habeas"><em>habeas corpus</em> cases</a> [JURIST news archive], while Guantanamo detainees have prevailed in 38.  In July, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo-detainees-habeas-petition.php">granted the <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/156-allal-ab-aljallil-abd-al-rahman/documents/8/pages/879#36">Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif</a> [NYT profile] and ordered his immediate release.

This is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12169123">first time life imprisonment</a> [BBC report] has been levied for blasphemy charges, which generally carries a mandatory death sentence. The men's lawyer says that he plans to appeal the case to the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> [official website], believing that his clients' sentence is motivated by sectarian differences. 

<p>Blasphemy laws were introduced in 1986 as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults, however, critics argue that they have recently been used to persecute those of minority faith, an argument that has had serious consequences. Last week, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Salman Taseer, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">was shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] by one of his own security guards, apparently because of his opposition to Pakistan's blasphemy law. Further controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an argument with other women in her village last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Foster, a former Army recruiter, <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7377099.html">denies allegations</a> [AP report] that he shot and killed a 30-year old woman in 2002 and then hid her body in a ditch. Foster claims that he was convicted due to ineffective assistance from his lawyer and that a blood-splatter test would exonerate him. Foster's petition to the Supreme Court follows orders by judges in the <a href="http://www.cca.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cca.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/handdown.asp?FullDate=20101230">dismissing Foster's petition for <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [order materials] and denying a motion to reconsider its refusal to hear Foster's <em>habeas</em> claim. Foster's execution had been scheduled for Tuesday night. There is no word on when the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear Foster's case.

<p>Controversy has surrounded the use of the death penalty in the US. On Tuesday, Illinois' state senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/illinois-senate-votes-to-abolish-death-penalty.php">voted to abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in that state after the Illinois House <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/illinois-house-votes-to-abolish-death-penalty-still-must-pass-lameduck-senate.php">voted to do the same</a> [JURIST report] last Friday. It is not clear, however, whether Illinois Governor Pat Quinn will sign the bill into law. Last August, the <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] heard a <em>habeas</em> petition from Troy Davis who was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia, police officer. In a rare move, the federal court heard the <em>habeas</em> petition after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text], but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence. <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] Executive Director Sarah Totonchi <a href="/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">argues</a> [JURIST commentary] that "'Troy Davis' case illustrates that U.S. courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge John Coughenour of the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] held that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013907861_primary12m.html">voters were not confused</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] by the current version of Washington state's ballot, which allows candidates to list which political party they prefer even if that party does not back the candidate. The top two vote-getters in a primary then advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, according to <a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/guide/text/872.pdf">Initiative 872</a> [text, PDF], which was passed in 2004. In the court opinion, Coughenour enumerated factors suggesting that Washington's implementation of its primary election ballot would not confuse the reasonable, well-informed electorate:<blockquote>Washington's ballot contains a prominent, unambiguous, explicit statement that a candidate's party preference does not imply a nomination, endorsement, or association with the political party. The ballot repeatedly states that candidates merely "prefer" the designated parties. Ballot inserts and the Voters' Pamphlet further explain the new system. Washington employed a widespread education campaign via various media outlets to inform voters about the new system. And Washington voters themselves, not simply their elected representatives, approved I-872.</blockquote> Furthermore, the court stated that the ballot was "consistent with the Supreme Court's conception of a constitutional ballot." The court also noted that the evidence of voter confusion offered by the political parties is both irrelevant and unpersuasive, and that the constitutionality of the ballot must not be considered from the viewpoint of an unreasonable, uninformed voter. David McDonald, attorney for the Democratic Party, a joining plaintiff, said he is certain the decision will be appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], with the possibility of being heard by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>].

<p>California is considering a similar "top-two" approach for primary elections. California congressional candidates and voters filed a <a href="http://gautamdutta.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sb-6-complaint-7-28-102.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in July 2010 seeking to <a href="http://gautamdutta.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sb-6-field-v-bowen-notice-of-motion-final-7-29-10.pdf">enjoin enforcement</a> [motion, PDF] of <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/pdf/sca-4-bill-20090219-chaptered.pdf">Proposition 14</a> [text], which alters the primary election system, creating an open primary where only the top two vote-getters would advance to the general election. Proposition 14, based largely on the system used in Washington, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/california-voters-opt-to-change-primary-election-system.php">approved by voters</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010 and changes elections to create a system in which all candidates for a state or federal office except for president would run in a single primary regardless of political affiliation. In 2008, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/go-supreme-court-rules-washington-state.php">upheld Washington's primary election system</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional against a <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] challenge, overturning a contrary decision by the Ninth Circuit. Louisiana has a similar system, but, under that system, a candidate who garners over 50 percent of the vote in the primary will forgo the general election.<br />

The law in question was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">passed in March</a> [JURIST report] and allows cabinet officials to postpone criminal proceedings against them for up to 18 months if the charges constitute a "legitimate impediment" to performing public duties.  The constitutional review of the law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/italy-judges-question-law-allowing.php">sought by judges in Milan</a> [JURIST report] where Berlusconi is charged in two cases on corruption and tax fraud.  The court was asked to decide whether the law violates the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html">Italian Constitution</a> [text] by improperly creating a new faculty for cabinet members through law rather than by a constitutional amendment. Additionally, the court must determine if it violates the constitutional principle that all individuals are equal under the law. The 15-judge court is expected to reach its <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hGxoPiNLGCXILUyqMXWCt8g1AZww?docId=ed58956095de4e098a6cac65cb469c65">decision on Thursday</a> [AP report].

<p>The proceedings mark the third time an immunity law protecting Berlusconi has been submitted to constitutional review. Laws submitted to the Constitutional Court in <a href="/paperchase/2004/01/berlusconi-corruption-trial-to-resume.htm">January 2004</a> and in <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/italy-high-court-strikes-down-immunity.php">October 2009</a> [JURIST reports] were both determined to be unconstitutional. In April 2010, Italian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/dnp.php">sought to indict Berlusconi</a> [JURIST report] on fraud and embezzlement charges involving his media company. The law granting Berlusconi immunity was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-lower-house-approves-bill-that.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] in February. In January, hundreds of Italy's judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked</a> out of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. Both laws have been criticized as being tailored for Berlusconi's benefit. He currently faces corruption and tax fraud trials, both of which have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-corruption-trial-of-pm-berlusconi.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report]. The leader has been previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a>, and has had other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The MSPB ruled that Chambers was wrongly discharged in December 2003 for discussing with a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> [official website] reporter that the US <a href="http://www.nps.gov/uspp/">Park Police Service</a> [official website] was in need of additional resources. The board ordered the government to reinstate Chambers within 20 days and to pay her the amount owed, including interest and legal fees, within 60 days of the decision. The opinion states, <blockquote>Because we find, as set forth below, that the agency did not meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed the appellant on administrative leave and removed her in the absence of her disclosures, and that the agency would in fact have taken no action against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures, we need not address whether removal is a reasonable penalty in light of the dismissal of charge two by the court.</blockquote> The DOI has not yet stated whether or not they plan to appeal the decision.

<p>In 2005 Chambers filed a <a href="http://www.peer.org/docs/nps/2005_24_2_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/environmental-brief-us-meatpackers-sue.php">report</a>] against the DOI claiming that it illegally destroyed documents regarding her employment as Chief of Police of the US Park Police Force. Chambers claimed that the performance evaluations, which would show that the charges relating to her December 2003 forced resignation were fabricated, have been destroyed. Chambers initially filed a complaint in January 2004 with the <a href="http://www.osc.gov/">Office of Special Counsel</a> (OSC) [official website] alleging that her placement on administrative leave constituted reprisal. The administrative judge dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and Chambers subsequently petitioned for judicial review with the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website].<br />

In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kentucky-v-king/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Kentucky v. King</a> [SCOTUSblog materials; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1272.pdf">argument transcript</a>], the Court will determine whether a lawful, police-created exigent circumstance is a permissible situation for a warrantless entry. Petitioner Hollis King was arrested and sentenced after law enforcement entered his apartment building in pursuit of an accused drug trafficker, whom police had witnessed selling drugs. In the interior of the building, police lost track of the suspect, however the scent of marijuana coming from King's apartment prompted them to seek entrance to that unit. When noises from inside the apartment raised suspicion that the suspect was inside, the police entered and found a substantial amount of drugs, but not the original suspect. The <a href="http://courts.ky.gov/supremecourt/">Kentucky Supreme Court</a> [official website], in holding that <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/09-1272_scky.pdf">the warrant exception did not apply</a> [opinion, PDF], announced a two-part test for police-created exigent circumstances, stating that the exigent circumstances exception does not apply if law enforcement created the exigent circumstances in bad faith or if the exigent circumstances were reasonably foreseeable from the police action. Kentucky sought <em>certorari</em> and at oral argument contended that the state Supreme Court's test is inconsistent with the US Supreme Court's repeated jurisprudence that, "the subjective intent of police officers when effecting a warrantless entry is irrelevant."

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sykes-v-united-states-2/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Sykes v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-11311.pdf">argument transcript</a>], the Court will determine whether fleeing from law enforcement in a vehicle after being ordered to stop is a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA. The petitioner, Marcus Sykes, faced an enhanced penalty under the ACCA for his third conviction of a violent felony after the District Court denied his objection that categorizing flight as a violent felony was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's recent ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/06-11206.pdf">Chambers v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF], which held that failing to report for parole was separate and distinct from escaping from a penal institution, and thus outside of the category of violent felonies listed in the ACCA. Petitioner's argument relied on the same distinction made in <u>Chambers</u>, namely that fleeing from police is a distince category of flight under the relevant <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title35/ar44/ch3.html">Indiana statute</a> [Indiana Code &#167; 35-44-3], and that category falls outside of crimes considered violent felonies for the purposes of the ACCA. The Court will revisit the ACCA later in this term when it hears argument in <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-seven-cases.php">McNeill v. United States</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09600SB3539ham001&GA=96&LegID=51489&SessionId=76&SpecSess=0&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=3539&GAID=10&Session=">amended bill</a> (SB3539) [amendment, text], <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/illinois-house-votes-to-abolish-death-penalty-still-must-pass-lameduck-senate.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the House last week, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-death-penalty-0112-20110111,0,1255503,full.story">passed 35-22</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] and now proceeds to <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] for his signature or veto.  It marks the first time the state legislature has voted to abolish the death penalty since former Governor George Ryan put a moratorium on it 10 years ago.  Supporters of the bill express concern over the possibility of innocent people being executed, especially after some people on death row have later been exonerated.  Opponents argue, alternatively, that the threat of the death penalty is an important tool for law enforcement officials.

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue worldwide.  According to an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">report</a>], the number of countries using the death penalty dropped in 2009, but more than 700 people were executed in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the US.  Last August, <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] heard a <em>habeas</em> petition from Troy Davis, who was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia police officer.  In a rare move, the federal court heard the <em>habeas</em> petition after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text], but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence.  <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [official website] Executive Director Sarah Totonchi <a href="/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">argues</a> [JURIST commentary] said that "Troy Davis' case illustrates that US courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] denied the state's request to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47495.html">block the program</a> [Politico report], which allocates greenhouse gas emission permits under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> [materials]. Texas is the only state in the nation to not allow permits for carbon dioxide permits to be distributed, neither by the federal government nor itself. Texas had also attempted to block the regulations in December in the District of Columbia court and a New Orleans federal appeals court. Those supporting the regulations say that Texas is stalling projects <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/011311dntexepagreenhouse.aa2f3022.html">to continue its grandstanding, while the state has indicated that it will continue</a> [<em>Dallas Morning News</em> report] numerous remaining challenges of the new rules.

<p>Last year the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] defeated a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.Res.26:">resolution</a> [materials] aimed at limiting the ability of the EPA to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">regulate greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST report] under the Clean Air Act. The measure, introduced by <a href="http://murkowski.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Home">Senator Lisa Murkowski</a> (R-AK) [official website], was defeated by a vote of 53 to 47 with six Democratic senators joining the Republican caucus in supporting the measure. The US Supreme Court affirmed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions under the Clear Air Act in its 2007 ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/05-1120">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">report</a>]. In its ruling, the court held that if the EPA could show a link between greenhouse gas emissions and public health and welfare then the act gives it the power to regulate emissions. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">announced last December</a> [JURIST report] that it had found that greenhouse gases "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fairey's iconic red, white and blue artistic rendering of the AP photo was used on campaign materials during the 2008 presidential election that were captioned with the word "HOPE." According to the agreement, "[n]either side surrenders its view of the legal issues surrounding the dispute." The AP and Fairey have agreed to share the profits of posters and merchandise bearing the "HOPE" image and will collaborate on future projects. However, Fairey is prohibited from using another AP photo without permission from the company. Fairey released a statement saying: <blockquote>I respect the work of photographers, as well as recognize the need to preserve opportunities for other artists to make fair use of photographic images. I often collaborate with photographers in my work, and I look forward to working with photos provided by the AP's talented photographers.</blockquote> The agreement also includes a financial settlement, but the details of this were not released.

<p>In February 2009 Fairey <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/arts/design/10fair.html">filed a lawsuit against AP</a> [NYT report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] seeking a declaration that he did not violate AP's copyright through the use of the AP photo as the basis for an artistic rendering of Obama. AP subsequently <a href="http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_031109.html">filed a countersuit</a> [AP press release] alleging that in fact Fairey had violated its copyrights. According to the AP, the posters and other merchandise based on the AP photo "copy all the distinctive and unequivocally recognizable elements of the [photo] in their entire detail, retaining the heart and essence of [the AP photo], including but not limited to its patriotic theme." In October 2009 Fairey released a <a href="http://obeygiant.com/images/2009/10/LA1-28598-v2-Shepard_Fairey_Statement_Re__AP_Matter_10-16-09.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] in which he admitted taking steps to conceal which photo he used at the basis for his "HOPE" Obama artwork. <br />

St. Eve could decide to free Black for time served during his two-year imprisonment, or set a date to determine how much of the remaining years on his original 6 1/2-year sentence he must now serve.

<p>In December, the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-reconsider-conrad-black-appeal.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] a request by Black for an<em> en banc</em> rehearing to reconsider the two remaining charges.  Black originally faced 17 counts of fraud, obstruction of justice, racketeering and tax evasion. He was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/indict/2005/us_v_black.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] by the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/media-mogul-conrad-black-stands-trial.php">diverting more than $80 million from Hollinger International and its shareholders</a> [JURIST report] during Hollinger's $2.1 billion sale of several hundred Canadian newspapers. In July 2007, Black was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice and sentenced to 78 months in prison. The court of appeals initially rejected Black's appeal, holding that &#167; 1346 may be applied in a private setting regardless of whether the defendant's conduct risked any foreseeable economic harm to the victim. The Supreme Court granted certiorari last year to determine the scope of the "honest services" clause, and held that Black had properly objected to the jury instructions at trial concerning the honest service doctrine and remanded the case to the circuit court for an opinion consistent with the judgment in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-enron-ex-ceo-appeal.php">Skilling v.

The moratorium was enacted after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>].

Although part of Ensco's lawsuit was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-13/rajaratnam-primary-global-evonik-j-j-nomura-in-court-news.html">dismissed in November</a> [Bloomberg report], complaints over the issuance of permits were retained.

<p>In December, DOJ filed <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/louisiana/laedce/2:2010cv04536/144523/1/">suit</a> [complaint text; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-ag-1442.html">press release</a>] against units of <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] and several other companies <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/doj-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST report]. In September, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rules-against-drilling-moratorium.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by several drilling companies challenging the offshore drilling moratorium. The judge held that there were "no substantial changes" between the July 12 directive and its predecessor, issued on May 28, that the new moratorium did nothing to amend or prevent the wrongs found in the first and that the wrongful behavior alleged in the original order could reasonably be expected to occur as a result of the more recent iteration. The US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-reinstate-original-drilling-moratorium.php">rejected a request to reinstate</a> the May 28 ban in July, weeks after the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit similarly <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">declined</a> [JURIST reports].

Lawyers for the DOJ also claimed that the district judge abused his discretion in issuing the injunction. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred in April of last year, resulted in an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, as <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">passed by the Italian senate</a> [JURIST report] in March, allowed cabinet officials to postpone criminal proceedings against them for up to 18 months if the charges constituted a "legitimate impediment" to performing public duties. After <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">holding hearings</a> [JURIST report]  on Tuesday, the court ruled in a vote of 12&#8211;3 to modify the law to allow up to a six&#8211;month postponement of charges, and gave the court the power to assess the severity of the charges in relation to how much they would disrupt state business. They found the original law in violation of Article Three of the <a href = "http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html">Italian Constitution</a> [text], which provides that "all citizens have equal social status and are equal before the law." The Court <A href = "http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/01/13/news/consiglio_consulta-11185858/?ref=HREA-1">declared the original law</a> [<em>La Repubblico</em> report, in Italian], an "unreasonable disparity between the rights of defense and the needs of jurisdiction." The constitutional review of the law was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/italy-judges-question-law-allowing.php">sought by judges in Milan</a> [JURIST report] where Berlusconi is charged in two cases on corruption and tax fraud.

<p>The proceedings mark the third time an immunity law protecting Berlusconi has been submitted to constitutional review. Laws submitted to the Constitutional Court in <a href = "/paperchase/2004/01/berlusconi-corruption-trial-to-resume.htm">January 2004</a> and in <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/italy-high-court-strikes-down-immunity.php">October 2009</a> [JURIST reports] were both determined to be unconstitutional. In April 2010, Italian prosecutors <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/dnp.php">sought to indict Berlusconi</a> [JURIST report] on fraud and embezzlement charges involving his media company. The law granting Berlusconi immunity was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/italy-lower-house-approves-bill-that.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href = "http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] in February. In January, hundreds of Italy's judges <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. Both laws have been criticized as being tailored for Berlusconi's benefit. He currently faces corruption and tax fraud trials, both of which have been <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/italy-corruption-trial-of-pm-berlusconi.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report]. The leader has been previously acquitted of <a href = "/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a>, and has had other charges against him <a href = "/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order permits the Department of Education to comply with requests for Teacher Data Reports (TDRs) containing teacher names recently made by several media outlets under New York's <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/coog/foil2.html">Freedom of Information Law</a> (FOIL) [text].  Justice Cynthia Kern denied the <a href="http://www.uft.org/">United Federation of Teachers'</a> (UFT) [advocacy website] petition to block the release on privacy grounds, finding that "courts have repeatedly held that release of job-performance related information, even negative information such as that involving misconduct, does not constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy."  UFT lawyers also argued that the data should remain sealed due to <a href="http://www.uft.org/videos/teachers-speak-out-about-tdr-errors">concerns about its accuracy</a>, though Kern cited precedent in ruling that information released under FOIL need not necessarily be reliable.  UFT <a href="http://www.uft.org/news/doe-can-release-flawed-data-reports-judge-rules">announced</a> [press releases] its intent to appeal, and indicated that city lawyers have agreed not to release the data until the matter is resolved.

<p>New York City employs approximately <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/default.htm">80,000 public school teachers</a> [official backgrounder], of whom 12,000 were included in the TDR pilot program that began during the 2007-08 academic year.  The reports <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Teachers/TeacherDevelopment/TeacherDataToolkit/tdi20102011">rely on standardized tests</a> [official materials] to compare predicted student progress to actual improvement, attributing the difference to the effectiveness of the student's teacher after correcting for variables such as the student's poverty level and native language.  TDRs have been disclosed previously under FOIL, though the releases did not include teachers' names.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the approved settlement, Picower's widow, Barbara, has agreed to forfeit an unprecedented <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-madoff-picower-20110113,0,6458159.story">$7.2 billion to Trustee Irving Picard</a> [LA Times report] to be returned to victims of the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme.  The settlement was approved by US Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in Manhattan over objections by some investors. Picower,  a philanthropist and businessman, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h27E-uW5Z_niFdRbBBaDJsyhJxsw?docId=58aade6473e44e52adf0de3392afafcd">drowned in October 2009</a> [AP report] after suffering a heart attack in the swimming pool of his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.  The settlement was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December10/picowerforfeituresettlementpr.pdf">announced</a> [press release] in December by US Attorney's office after Picard, the trustee responsible for liquidating Madoff&#8217;s assets, including his investment firm, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-13/federal-judge-approves-madoff-trustee-accord-with-estate-of-jeffry-picower.html">sued Picower in May 2009</a> [Bloomberg report].  Barbara Picower agreed to return all profits received from the Madoff firm but insists that her husband was unaware of Madoff's fraudulent activities and was never charged with a crime.  With the Picower forfeiture, authorities have collected a total of $9.8 billion related to the Madoff fraud.

<p>In December, Picard filed close to 60 lawsuits in an <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">attempt to recover more than $40 billion</a> [JURIST report] from numerous banks, hedge funds and individuals, coinciding with the two-year deadline for seeking compensation.

The group's annual assessment, <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=594">Freedom in the World 2011</a> [materials], reports that 25 countries showed significant declines in 2010, while 11 countries showed increases, amounting to what Freedom House calls an "authoritarian challenge to democracy." According to the report, the democratic world showed little resistance to the continuing repressive authoritarian regimes of the world, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china">China</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=venezuela">Venezuela</a> [JURIST news archives]. Freedom House Executive Director David J. Kramer <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&release=1310">urged the world's democracies</a> [press release] to respond to the changes, saying that authoritarian governments "are not just engaging in widespread repression, they are doing so with unprecedented aggressiveness and self-confidence, and the democratic community is not rising to the challenge." The number of "Free" countries fell from 89 to 87, with Ukraine and Mexico now classified as "Partly Free." The number of electoral democracies dropped to 115, the lowest number since 1995. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guinea+bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti">Haiti</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> were removed from the list of electoral democracies and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tanzania">Tanzania</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tonga">Tonga</a> [JURIST news archives] were added. The nine states rated the most repressive in respect to political rights and civil liberties were <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burma">Burma</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=equatorial+guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=north+korea">North Korea</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sudan">Sudan</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> [JURIST news archives].

Ukraine was pushed to the "Partly Free" list after repressing freedoms of the press and experiencing <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ukraine-mps-could-face-charges-for.php">election fraud</a> [JURIST report] and the politicization of the judiciary. In April, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy group] urged the Ukrainian government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ukraine-urged-to-ensure-accountability.php">ensure accountability for human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. AI also urged Ukraine to record and monitor incidents of racially motivated crimes and to create a fair asylum system. Mexico lost its "Free" status after the <a href="/hotline/2009/09/resignation-of-mexican-attorney-general.php">government's failure</a> [JURIST report] to curb the country's violence and drug trafficking. Freedom House <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=277">measures civil liberties and political rights</a> [backgrounder] of a country and assigns an overall "freedom status" of "Free," "Partly Free," or "Not Free" based on the results.<br />

Expressing his desire to challenge the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Schmidt wrote:<blockquote>The Act's mandate that all citizens and legal residents of the United States maintain qualifying healthcare coverage or pay a penalty (the individual mandate) is an unprecedented attempt to expand federal power that would encroach on the sovereignty of the State of Kansas and on the rights of our citizens. Our belief is that this expansion of federal power exceeds the authority granted to the federal government by the United States Constitution.</blockquote>In requesting that Kansas be joined, Schmidt fulfilled a campaign promise he made during the general election. Schmidt took office on Monday. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/101410healthcareruling.pdf">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">report</a>], allowing the lawsuit to continue through the courts.

Also in December, federal judges in <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">New Jersey</a> [JURIST reports] dismissed lawsuits challenging the health care law's constitutionality. In November, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-first-challenge-to-health-care-law.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] the first preliminary challenge to the law.

Florida's lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and joined by <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">20 states</a> [JURIST reports] and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt10_user.html">Tenth Amendment</a> [texts] of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to AI, the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) provided Harun a helicopter so he could attend a meeting. Under Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/ICC-ASP-3-Res1_English.pdf">Negotiated Relationship Agreement</a> [agreement, PDF] between the ICC and the UN, both organizations are supposed to "cooperate closely with each other and consult each other on matters of mutual interest..." and that the UN violated that agreement by providing transportation for Harun. AI's representative at the UN, Renzo Pomi, criticized the UN's actions in the statement:<blockquote> It's outrageous that someone who is wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity and war crimes is given transport by UN without being arrested. While the efforts by UNMIS to defuse tensions and prevent human rights violations should be applauded, providing a safe haven to somebody wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, instead of arresting him, is inconsistent with the UN's obligations.</blockquote> Harun, a former Sudanese interior minister, faces 20 counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and torture, and 22 counts of war crimes, including attacks against the civilian population, destruction of property and pillaging.

<p>Last year, ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> called on the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/icc-prosecutor-seeks-un-support-for-arrest-of-suspected-sudan-war-criminals.php">support the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Harun and another war crimes suspect. Ocampo urged the Security Council to secure the execution of the outstanding arrest warrants in light of the fact that the Sudanese government, which bears the primary responsibility to do so, had not. Also last year, Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-reports-sudan-to-un-for-lack-of-cooperation-with-arrest-warrants.php">referred Sudan to the Security Council</a> [JURIST report] for lack of cooperation in the pursuit of Harun and Kushayb. ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I released a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc868180.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] asking the Security Council to take any steps it deems appropriate to compel Sudan to comply with its obligation under <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc868180.pdf">Security Council Resolution 1593</a> [text, PDF], which provides that "the Government of Sudan and all other parties to the conflict in Darfur shall cooperate fully with and provide any necessary assistance to the Court and the Prosecutor pursuant to this resolution.'' Since the ICC concluded that it has exhausted all its resources, the responsibility will now be shifted to the Security Council to take appropriate action. Sudan, which is not a permanent member of the ICC under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], refuses to recognize the court's jurisdiction, stating that "the International Criminal Court has no place in this crisis at all."</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to government statistics, at least 21 civilians have been killed since the protests over unemployment and rising food costs began on December 17. According to Pillay, however, the number of deaths is most likely even higher. Pillay expressed her "concern" over the violence and killings and called for a "transparent, credible and independent" investigation into the oppression of demonstrators. She encouraged the government to find those officials responsible for the violence stating, "If there is evidence that members of the security forces have used excessive force, or conducted extra-judicial killings, they must be arrested, tried and - if found guilty of offences - punished according to the law. It is essential that justice is done, and is seen to be done." Pillay also urged Tunisian officials to work towards adopting better policies to help alleviate the economic strife of its civilians and to "lift severe limitations on freedoms of assembly, opinion and expression, as well as association." President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Thursday <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/13/tunisia.protests/">promised</a> [CNN report] to cut prices on basic food supplies and order security forces not to use live ammunition except in cases of self-defense.

<p>Tunisia has been accused of numerous human rights violations over the past few years. In 2009, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/tunisia-continues-to-violate-human.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging Tunisia was continuing to commit hundreds of human rights abuses despite previous vows to cease. The report detailed the arrest, torture, and detention of prisoners in the name of national security, and even the kidnapping and forced return of Tunisians living abroad. In June 2008, AI released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE30/007/2008/en/b8527bf4-3ebc-11dd-9656-05931d46f27f/mde300072008eng.html">report</a> [text] accusing Tunisia of committing widespread human rights abuses under overly-broad anti-terrorism legislation. AI also criticized the US, as well as European and other Arab countries, for <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/tunisia-appeals-court-affirms-terror.php">turning over terror suspects to Tunisian authorities</a> [JURIST report] despite allegations of torture and other abuses. In February, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against the deportation of a former Tunisian terrorism suspect, finding he would likely be <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/europe-rights-court-upholds-absolute.php">subjected to torture</a> [JURIST report] in violation of Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF text] if returned to Tunisia. In September 2007, Human Rights Watch released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2007/09/04/ill-fated-homecomings">report</a> [text] accusing Tunisian officials of <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/tunisia-abusing-ex-guantanamo-detainees.php">mistreating two former Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] after they were returned to the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeal follows a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">July ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts which found that Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriages as being between a man and a woman, violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. In its brief, the DOJ contends that DOMA is in line with those sections of the constitution, stating that DOMA was "rationally related" to maintaining "consistency in the distribution of federal marriage-based benefits." The DOJ further contended that DOMA was permissible under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/469/528/case.html">Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority </a> [text] because the act, as a "proper exercise of Congress' Spending Clause authority", does not violate the Tenth Amendment. Despite a footnote within the brief stating that the DOJ follows a practice of defending federal statutes even if the administration disagrees with the law, rights groups <a href="http://www.hrc.org/15204.htm">expressed disappointment</a> [HRC press release] with the filing. 

<p>Likely buoyed by the result in Massachusetts, in November other rights groups filed multiple suits <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-grous-file-lawsuits-challenging-defense-of-marriage-act.php">challenging the constitutionality of DOMA</a> [JURIST report]. Consistent with its statement in this most recent brief, the Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-extends-benefits-to-same-sex.php">extended some federal benefits</a> [JURIST report] to same-sex couples, including allowing domestic partners to be added to insurance programs, to use medical facilities, and to be included in family size and house allocation considerations. In June, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/obama-extends-additional-benefits-to-same-sex-partners-of-federal-employees.php">ordered executive agencies to expand</a> [JURIST report] federal childcare subsidies and services and travel and relocation payments to the same-sex partners of federal employees and their children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=12606043">denies there are delays</a> [AP report] and say that the additional time is due to new safety precautions to which the DOI must adhere. 

<p>In December, the DOJ filed <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/louisiana/laedce/2:2010cv04536/144523/1/">suit</a> [complaint text; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-ag-1442.html">press release</a>] against units of <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] and several other companies <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/doj-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST report]. In September, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rules-against-drilling-moratorium.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by several drilling companies challenging the offshore drilling moratorium. The judge held that there were "no substantial changes" between the July 12 directive and its predecessor, issued on May 28, that the new moratorium did nothing to amend or prevent the wrongs found in the first and that the wrongful behavior alleged in the original order could reasonably be expected to occur as a result of the more recent iteration. The US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-reinstate-original-drilling-moratorium.php">rejected a request to reinstate</a> the May 28 ban in July, weeks after the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit similarly <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">declined</a> [JURIST reports]. The DOJ originally asked the appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">stay the preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] in June, on the basis that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill with catastrophic results. Lawyers for the DOJ also claimed that the district judge abused his discretion in issuing the injunction. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred in April of last year, resulted in an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote overruled Nazarbayev's decision last week to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70D2W920110114?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">veto the proposed referendum</a> [Reuters report]. Nazarbayev's current term is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hC0UZaZYP61Wl02Dqvs2siKnjthA?docId=CNG.c0a719d0daf7352ff943520a2d71d930.a1">set to expire in 2012</a> [AP report], but if he approves the parliamentary vote, he could achieve a 30-year term in office. Supporters of the referendum <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=expert_opinions&news_id=248">maintain that it is necessary</a> [Interfax report] in order to ensure that Nazarbayev can continue to address issues facing the country. They also indicated that continuity of government is necessary for the country's continued growth. Opponents have argued that Nazarbayev's political party is attempting to eliminate any political competition. The <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr">Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a> (ODIHR) [official website] emphasized the <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/74925">need for democratic elections</a> [press release], arguing that the proposed referendum "does not offer a genuine choice between political alternatives and would infringe on the opportunity of citizens to hold their representatives accountable and to effectively exercise their right to vote and be elected." The referendum will reportedly take place as early as March 2011. 

<p>The Kazakhstan Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kazakhstan-parliament-approves-plan-for-presidential-term-extension-referendum.php">initially approved</a> [JURIST report] the referendum last month. In June, Nazarbayev announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kazakhstan-president-declines-to-sign-bill-extending-powers.php">would not sign a controversial law</a> [JURIST report] that would grant him several presidential powers for life, even if he stepped down from office. Nazarbayev's supporters believed that the president has earned such protections due to his ability as a nation builder. The draft law moved quickly through Kazakhstan's parliament in May with the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kazakhstan-approves-constitutional-amendments-to-increase-presidential-powers.php">upper</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kazakhstan-lower-house-approves-bill-to-increase-presidents-power.php">lower</a> [JURIST reports] houses approving the bill in under a week. In 2007, Nazarbayev <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/kazakhstan-president-approves.php">approved a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] removing term limits on his own presidency, effectively allowing him to remain president for life. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk is <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">currently standing trial</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for 27,900 accessory accounts stemming from his alleged involvement as a guard at <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor concentration camp</a> [Death Camps backgrounder]. In issuing the ruling, Judge Ismael Moreno indicated that Demjanjuk's actions caused him to be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12194991">complicit in the commission of genocide</a> [BBC report] and crimes against humanity. Moreno, acting under Spain's universal jurisdiction law, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5guNxf3Vs1thbQdFDqyZ1RReZe60w?docId=91121eeeff844decb286e11d9e32d2c7">issued the European arrest warrant</a> [AP report] so that Demjanjuk can be extradicted to Spain at the end of his trial in Germany. The investigation into Demjanjuk's alleged involvement in the camp began in 2008 following a request by Spanish Holocaust survivors to the National Court asking the court to investigate four alleged ex-Nazi camp guards, including Demjanjuk. Moreno <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/alleged-nazi-guards-indicted-by-spanish.php">issued arrest warrants for three of the accused men</a> in September 2009, but an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk was not issued at that time because he had already been <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/accused-nazi-guard-deported-to-germany.php">deported to Germany</a> [JURIST reports] by the US. The German court trying Demjanjuk will now have to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703959104576081711925916404.html">determine if he should be extradited</a> [WSJ report] at the conclusion of his trial.

<p>The German trial of Demjanjuk, which began in November 2009, has been marked by multiple appeals relating to his health, as well as efforts to dismiss the charges against him. Last May, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals</a> [JURIST reports] relating to his health, although the court has limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was deported to Germany after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].  It is alleged that Demjanjuk <a href="http://www.abendzeitung.de/muenchen/92205">volunteered to work at Sobibor</a> [<em>Abendzeitung</em> report, in German] after being captured by German forces while serving as a member of the Soviet army.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The declaration came a day after Ben Ali <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/13/tunisia.protests/">promised to cut prices</a> [CNN report] on basic food supplies and order security forces not to use live ammunition except in cases of self-defense, as an attempt to end the protests. The protests were mostly against Ben Ali and his family, who controlled numerous sectors of the economy and are accused of corruption. Efforts to end the protests failed, however, and within hours of the announcement, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025">Ben Ali had fled the country</a> [BBC report] after 23 years in office, leaving <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] to assume power as interim president. In an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZIIfHSNSmc">announcement on state television</a> [video, in Arabic], Ghannouchi cited Chapter 56 of the Tunisian <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ts00000_.html">Constitution</a> [text], allowing the president to delegate his powers to the prime minister. He went on to assert that the government would adhere to the rule of law and that the announced reforms would still be implemented.

<p>In January, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] urged the Tunisian government to investigate the deaths of public protesters and called on government security forces to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-rights-chief-urges-investigation-into-protestor-deaths-in-Tunisia.php">admit use of excessive force against them</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay expressed her "concern" over the violence and killings and called for a "transparent, credible and independent" investigation into the oppression of demonstrators. She encouraged the government to find those officials responsible for the violence stating, "If there is evidence that members of the security forces have used excessive force, or conducted extra-judicial killings, they must be arrested, tried and - if found guilty of offences - punished according to the law. It is essential that justice is done, and is seen to be done." Pillay also urged Tunisian officials to work towards adopting better policies to help alleviate the economic strife of its civilians and to "lift severe limitations on freedoms of assembly, opinion and expression, as well as association."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law took effect January 1 and creates the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media and Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the law, the government can Impose costly fines on broadcasters, newspapers and news websites if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority. AI Deputy Director of International Europe and Central Asia programme, Andrea Huber, expressed fears that the components of the new law will severely infringe upon the rights members of the media:<blockquote>The vagueness of the restrictions imposed by the new media legislation is very concerning and highly likely to have an adverse effect on freedom of expression. ... Facing the possibility of stringent fines or even closure, many journalists and editors are likely to choose the 'safe' option of modifying their content. ... The breadth of the restrictions, the lack of clear guidelines for journalists and editors and the strong powers of the new regulatory body all risk placing unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions to freedom of expression in Hungary.</blockquote>The law has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-defends-controversial-media-law-in-face-of-eu-criticism.php">harshly criticized by members of the media</a> [JURIST report], as well as other European governments, as too restrictive of free expression, and the European Commission has requested more information on the law to determine whether it complies with EU law. In response to the protests, <a href="http://www.miniszterelnok.hu/in_english_cv_of_viktor_orban/">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official profile] has stated that he is willing to amend the law if the EU finds it discriminatory, a determination he <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/hungary-politics.7yl/">doubts because of its similarity</a> [EUBusiness report] to other EU media laws in his opinion.

<p>The <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">Hungarian Parliament</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BK6KF20101221">approved the law</a> [Reuters report] in December, amid protests and criticism. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/">Constitutional Court of Hungary</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/hungary-hate-speech-amendments.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two proposals passed by the country's parliament to criminalize hate speech as unconstitutional infringements on the freedom of expression. The court held that the extremist speech that the amendments sought to prevent was not a danger to society because it was already marginalized. The first bill would have allowed recovery in cases where a person's ethnic group, rather than the individual person, was insulted. The second bill would have designated national, ethnic, racial or religious insults as misdemeanors punishable by up to two years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new regulations, to be promulgated as modifications of the <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr515_main_02.tpl">Cuban Assets Control</a> [31 CFR &#167; 515.101 <em>et seq.</em>] and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=8b684ec5c62f1adda0d3984257ecc67f&rgn=div6&view=text&node=19:1.0.1.1.21.15&idno=19">Customs and Border Protection</a> [19 CFR &#167; 122.151 <em>et seq.</em>] regulations, will allow greater travel from the US to Cuba for religious and educational purposes, the transfer of up to $2000 per year to non-family members in Cuba so long as they are not senior government or Communist Party leaders, and will allow all US international airports to service charter flights between the two countries. Explaining the reasons for the new regulations, the press release stated:<blockquote>The President believes these actions, combined with the continuation of the embargo, are important steps in reaching the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all its citizens.  These steps build upon the President's April 2009 actions to help reunite divided Cuban families; to facilitate greater telecommunications with the Cuban people; and to increase humanitarian flows to Cuba.</blockquote>The regulations will build off of those <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php">issued in April 2009</a> [JURIST report], which eased travel and remittances restrictions for Cuban Americans and their families in Cuba only. The new rules will take effect once published in the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/">Federal Register</a> [official website] within two weeks. 

<p>The propriety of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/11113/uscuba_relations.html">US embargo on Cuba</a> [CFR backgrounder], in effect since 1962, has been a topic of debate in recent years. In July, the US House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/house-committee-votes-to-lift-cuba-travel-trade-restrictions.php">voted to lift travel and trade restrictions</a> [JURIST report] to Cuba. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.4645:">Travel Restriction Reform and Export Enhancement Act</a> [HR 4645 materials] would have eliminated travel bans to Cuba and prohibited money transfer restrictions. The Treasury Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-treasury-eases-cuba-travel.php">lifted some travel restrictions and restrictions on money transfers</a> [JURIST report] between Cuban Americans and their families in Cuba in September 2009. The department also authorized US telecommunications companies to work within Cuba to facilitate communication between families split between the two countries. In October 2008, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] urging the US to lift the embargo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These events include the killing of four Palestinians by the <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website], all of which were not justified according to Falk, and the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17913606?story_id=17913606&fsrc=rss">demolition of the Shepherd Hotel</a> [Economist report] in East Jerusalem in order to build more Jewish <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Settlements/Index.asp">settlements</a> [B'Tselem backgrounder]. The settlements, according to Falk, were part of an "accelerating pattern in Jerusalem that consists of shifting the demographic balance to reinforce Israeli claims to control permanently the entire city," thereby making Palestinian claims for an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital impossible. Falk explained the significance of these events:<blockquote>Together these events demonstrate a general and unacceptable Israeli disposition to use excessive force against Palestinians, who are already suffering from prolonged occupation. It is impossible to separate this pattern of excessive use of force against Palestinians from the indiscriminate use of force against civilians in Israel's larger occupation policy, as illustrated by the cruel punitive blockade that has been imposed on the people of Gaza for more than three years and by the illegal manner in which Israel carried out attacks for three weeks on the defenseless population of Gaza two years ago. It is time for the international community to step in and offer this long vulnerable Palestinian population protection against the violence perpetrated by Israeli authorities.</blockquote>Falk went on to call for the international community to take steps to protect Palestinians from Israeli forces.

<p>Israel has faced ongoing criticism from the UN and international human rights groups for its action in the Palestinian territories, which have been under Israeli military control since 1967. In June, Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B'Tselem</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/palestinian-rights-advance-in-2009-but-need-improvement-report.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report], noting an advancement in the rights of Palestinians, but calling for greater improvement. The report found that fatalities had declined by 80 percent compared to the previous year, and the quality of life had improved in the West Bank. The report called on Israel to dismantle all settlements, saying that merely halting new settlements is insufficient. The rights organization also chided Israeli security forces for not adequately protecting Palestinians from violence at the hands of Israelis, criticizing a "history of leniency" against the perpetrators of that violence. In March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-illegal-west.php">called Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank "illegal"</a> [JURIST report], and supported a plan by Palestinian Authority <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757273.stm">Prime Minister Salam Fayyad</a> [BBC profile] to build the institutions of an independent state by 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The former four term governor was convicted for attempting to manipulate the state's riverboat casino licensing process for his personal gain.

In 2008, Edward <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/felons-seeking-pardons-before-bush.php">sought clemency</a> [JURIST report] from US President George W. Bush before left office, which was never granted.

<p>After serving four terms as governor from 1972-96, Edwards was convicted in 2000 for the extortion scheme. In 2004, US District Judge Ralph Tyson <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/louisiana-judge-upholds-conviction-of.php">refused to overturn</a> [JURIST report] Edwards' conviction.  The rejected defense motion claimed a political bias on the part of the trial judge and additionally contended that he was impaired by painkillers as he presided over the trial.

The council, the country's highest legal authority on constitutional issues, declared that the leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/January/middleeast_January262.xml&section=middleeast">will assume power</a> [AFP report] until elections are held in two months. The council made its ruling at the request of <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] and based its ruling on article 57 of the constitution, declaring a "definitive" vacation of the presidency. Before flying out of Tunis to seek refuge in Saudi Arabia, Ben Ali signed a decree granting interim presidential powers to Ghannouchi, attempting to leave open the possibility of returning to office. Mebezza <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111513513854222.html">took the oath of office</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] on Saturday and according to the council he should organize new presidential elections within 60 days.

<p>On Friday, Ben Ali <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] amid nationwide protests, banning public gatherings and allowing police to fire on anyone refusing to obey orders. The declaration came a day after Ben Ali <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/13/tunisia.protests/">promised to cut prices</a> [CNN report] on basic food supplies and order security forces not to use live ammunition except in cases of self-defense, as an attempt to end the protests. The protests were largely against Ben Ali and his family, who controlled numerous sectors of the economy and face accusations of corruption. Efforts to end the protests failed and within hours of the announcement Ben Ali <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025">had fled the country</a> [BBC report] after 23 years in office, leaving Ghannouchi to assume power as interim president. In an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZIIfHSNSmc">announcement on state television</a> [video, in Arabic], Ghannouchi cited Chapter 56 of the Tunisian <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ts00000_.html">Constitution</a> [text], allowing the president to delegate his powers to the prime minister. He went on to assert that the government would adhere to the rule of law and that the announced reforms would still be implemented. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ex-federal judge <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thomas+porteous">Thomas Porteous</a> [JURIST news archive] voluntarily surrendered his law license after being convicted on four articles of impeachment and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-remove-federal-judge-from-bench.php">removed by Congress</a> [JURIST report] in December. Pursuant to the order, Porteous is no longer permitted to practice law or seek readmission to the practice of law in Louisiana or in any other jurisdiction. Porteous was accused of accepting bribes from lawyers while a judge for the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], making false statements in his bankruptcy declaration and lying to Congress during his confirmation.

<p>The US <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-votes-to-impeach-federal-judge.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] in March to impeach Porteous. After an <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/news/news/PorteousOrder/REPORT%20BY%20SPECIAL%20INVESTIGATORY%20COMMITTEE.PDF">investigation</a> [report text, PDF] by a special committee, the Judicial Conference found "substantial evidence" that Porteous had signed false financial disclosure forms, falsified statements in a personal bankruptcy proceeding, made false representations to secure a bank loan and violated <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC00201.html">criminal laws</a> [text] and ethical rules by soliciting and receiving "cash and other things of value" from lawyers in a bench trial over which he was presiding. Porteous' decision in that case, <u>In re Liljeberg enters v.

A House committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-committee-approves-impeachment.php">began investigating Porteous</a> [JURIST report] in 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmilitarycommission.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A US Military panel <a href="http://mldc.whs.mil/download/documents/Draft%20Report/MLDC%20Final%20Report%20Predecisional%20Draft%2022DEC2010.pdf">has recommended</a> [report, PDF] in its latest report released Friday that women should be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. The <a href="http://mldc.whs.mil/">Military Leadership Diversity Commission</a> (MLDC) [official website], comprised of retired and current military leaders, says that women, who under current defense policy are prohibited from serving in direct line-of-fire combat, should be permitted to serve in combat and that integration of women into combat forces would have no ill effects. The commission recommends a "time-phased" approach to the implementation of new combat policies that would create additional career options for women that include "direct ground combat." The report addressed common concerns among military officials that inclusion of women in combat forces would present problems with unit cohesion and that the current policy is effective due to current warfare techniques. The commission's conclusion is that in Iraq and Afghanistan women have already been exposed to combat-related activities, with no negative effects, and that the current policy is discriminatory to women. Commissioner <a href="http://mldc.whs.mil/index.php/odonnell">Mary O'Donnell</a> [official profile] called the current military policy banning women from combat discrimination "of the first order": <blockquote>This is 2010, and as we look at outyears for war, it will probably be much more electronic than it is now. We have things from Creech Air Force Base fighting unmanned vehicles in Afghanistan right now. So we cannot look at the war that was fought in Vietnam and compare that to today or future wars. It's going to be totally different. This has to do with every American citizen being able to be considered for anything that they are qualified to do. It's about discrimination at its very basics.</blockquote> The commission's overall recommendation was to eliminate all barriers preventing women from combat-related activities in the military and to gradually phase in new policies over the next few years. The commission <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gMnhcpjeDHembcX5dBCDgH-Kkf4g?docId=30fc279b4cb34cd691598bcc5fd15bce">will present its findings</a> [AP report] to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] and Congress later this year. 

<p>The commission report comes on the heels of the repeal of the military's controversial <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. In December, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill to repeal the policy. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives. The Obama administration had been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Earlier this year, three former service members discharged under DADT filed a complaint against the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-file-suit-seeking-reinstatement.php">seeking reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] and the declaration that their discharges under the statute, and the statute itself, are unconstitutional. In November, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] made the statement while considering a complaint from the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] seeking to have the CIA <a href="http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=13842791">found in contempt of court</a> [AP report] for destroying the tapes. After the judge spoke, Assistant US Attorney Tara LaMorte said that the government prosecutor who investigated the incident was willing to meet with the judge to discuss his findings. Hellerstein agreed to meet with the prosecutor and said he would make as much of the meeting public as possible. 

<p>Internal CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] released last April reveal that the former head of the agency Porter Goss may have <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">agreed to the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] showing harsh interrogations of terror suspects. According to redacted <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] filed in March 2009, 12 of 92 videotapes <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destroyed by the CIA</a> [JURIST report] contained evidence of "enhanced interrogation techniques." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had acknowledged in March 2009 that the CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 videotapes of high value terrorism suspect interrogations, in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information.

Forty-seven prisoners have reportedly been executed in Iran since the new year, many from the country's Kurdish minority. "The execution of Kurdish activists, without fair trials and following torture, increasingly appears as a systematic, politically motivated process," said Aaron Rhodes, a spokesperson for the Campaign. The Campaign called on "the Iranian Parliament and the Judiciary to immediately institute a moratorium on executions and to move swiftly to abolish the death penalty, in the face of skyrocketing executions following unfair trials and opaque judicial proceedings." Iran executes more people per capita than any other country, and in absolute numbers, is second only to China, according to the Campaign. 

<p>Earlier this month, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Also, this month, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report] for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].

Duvalier returned to Haiti on Sunday stating that he had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12208109">come to offer assistance</a> [BBC report] to help the country recover from last year's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive]. Duvalier was president of Haiti from 1971 to 1986. During that time, AI claims Duvalier and his regime committed acts of "systematic torture," including the disappearance or execution hundreds of human rights activists and other pro-democracy individuals at the hands of Haiti's armed forces and private militia, "<em>tonton macoutes</em>." Duvalier has also been accused of embezzling millions of dollars from the country. AI representative Javier Zuniga urged the country's authorities to prosecute Duvalier and others who were responsible for the human rights abuses:
<blockquote>The widespread and systematic human rights violations committed in Haiti during Dubalier's rule amount to crimes against humanity. Haiti is under the obligation to prosecute him and anyone else responsible for such crimes. ... The Haitian authorities must break the cycle of impunity that prevailed for decades in Haiti.  Failing to bring to justice those responsible will only lead to further human rights abuses.</blockquote>Other rights organizations, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], joined AI in <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/17/haiti-prosecute-duvalier">calling for prosecution</a> [press release] of the former president, stating that the only purpose for Duvalier's return to Haiti should be "to face justice."

<p>Last February, the <a href="http://www.bger.ch/fr/index/federal.htm">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] announced that $4.6 million seized from Duvalier's Swiss bank account <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/switzerland-court-orders-return-of.php">must be returned to his family</a> [JURIST report]. The decision came after the <a href="http://www.bstger.ch/index.asp?idL=fr">Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] rejected the family's claim to Duvalier's money, which was hidden in Swiss banks during his tenure as president. In 2007, Haitian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4718966.stm">Rene Preval</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/haiti-president-vows-to-continue-legal.php">vowed to continue legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Duvalier despite the latter's plea for forgiveness in a recorded message broadcast around the country. Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he succeeded as "president for life." In response to accusations of human rights violations, Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, and has since resided in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The names of those indicted will be <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=123808#axzz1BOW9WVLn">kept confidential</a> [<em>Lebanon Daily Star</em> report] until the pretrial judge reviews and approves the indictment, but many believe that the indictment names members of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9155/hezbollah_aka_hizbollah_hizbullah.html">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder]. The review process could take close to three months. Bellemore noted the significance of the indictment, stating:<blockquote>This is an important moment for the People of Lebanon. It marks the launch of the judicial phase of the Tribunal's work. For the first time, a legal case has been launched by an international Tribunal against those responsible for a political assassination in Lebanon. This step has been taken at the request and on behalf of the People of Lebanon and in fulfillment of a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. This is also an important moment for the international community - and for those who believe in international justice.</blockquote>Last week, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/world/middleeast/13lebanon.html?scp=9&sq=lebanon&st=cse">Hezbollah dissolved the Lebanese government</a> [NYT report] when Prime Minister Saad Hariri, son of the slain former prime minister, refused to publicly reject the STL. Hezbollah supporters in Beirut <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=204124">publicly protested the indictment</a>[<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] Tuesday.

<p>In August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> a week earlier after Hezbollah <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. Last February, the head of the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/lebanon-tribunal-head-says-hariri-probe.php">reassured</a> [JURIST report] the Lebanese public that the investigation is on track. When asked about the progress of the investigation into the death of Hariri, the head of the STL "underlined the fact that the Tribunal already has in place all the legal and administrative instruments necessary for its work, and is fully operational so that justice may be dispensed with complete independence and impartiality in accordance with the highest international standards." The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-511.htm">Jackson v. DC Board of Elections and Ethics</a> [docket], the court denied <em>certiorari</em> without comment in a case over whether to allow a public referendum over Washington, DC's <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage law</a> [JURIST news archive]. The order leaves in place the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/dc-appeals-court-rules-against-same-sex-marriage-ballot.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals against the referendum. The <a href="http://www.dcboee.org/">Board of Elections and Ethics</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/18/AR2011011802214.html">contended</a> [WP report] that allowing such a referendum would violate the District's Human Rights Law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">denied an emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the same-sex marriage law from taking effect. 

<p>The court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-487.htm">al-Adahi v. Obama</a> [docket], an appeal by a Yemeni detainee seeking reinstatement of a previous order that he be released from <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. The US District Court for the District of Columbia had held that the US did <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo.php">not present sufficient</a> evidence to justify further detention of the accused al-Qaeda supporter, but it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-federal-appeals-court-overturns-guantanamo-habeas-grant.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] by a unanimous panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The government has argued that Mohammed al-Adahi, detained since 2002, was a supporter or member of the Taliban and/or al-Qaeda, claiming that al-Adahi had acted as an instructor at al Qaeda camp al Farouq, had familial ties to both the Taliban and al Qaeda, and had been employed as a bodyguard for Osama bin-Laden, and that al-Adahi's story lacked credibility. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision to deny <em>certiorari</em>. It is unclear whether she will participate in any of the impending Guantanamo <em>habeas</em> cases.</p>

<p>The Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in a consolidated case over the issue of whether the Supremacy Clause preempts Medicaid recipients and providers from bringing a suit challenging a California state law that reduces reimbursement rates. The court consolidated three cases that raised the issue:<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08a625.htm"> Maxwell-Jolly v. Independent Living Center of Southern California</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/09-958_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-283.htm">Maxwell-Jolly v.

California Pharmacists Association</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/09-1158_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF].

In a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1670">press conference</a> [transcript] held in Abu Dhabi, where Ban was attending a global energy forum, he cited the most recent bouts of violence and subsequent loss of lives and property as pressing reasons for the prompt restoration of political stability. To establish a successful and long-lasting rule of law, Ban encouraged leaders to consider and work to accommodate the social and economic needs of the Tunisian citizens, whose protests have been attributed to the rising prices of necessities, a decline in available employment opportunities and allegations of corruption and restrictions on their rights and freedoms. He also encouraged the international community to support Tunisia and its leaders during this time, which he described as "a moment for the Tunisian people to strengthen the country's longstanding culture of political moderation and its attachment to peace." 

<p>The Tunisia Constitutional Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">officially announced</a> [JURIST report] last week that <a href="http://www.carthage.tn/en/index.php">President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [official website] had permanently left the office of the president. The council, the country's highest legal authority on constitutional issues, declared that the leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, will <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/January/middleeast_January262.xml&section=middleeast">assume power</a> [AFP report] until elections are held in two months. The council made its ruling at the request of <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] and based its ruling on article 57 of the constitution, declaring a "definitive" vacation of the presidency. Before flying out of Tunis to seek refuge in Saudi Arabia, Ben Ali signed a decree granting interim presidential powers to Ghannouchi, attempting to leave open the possibility of returning to office. Mebezza <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111513513854222.html">took the oath of office</a> [Al Jazeera report] on Saturday and according to the council he should organize new presidential elections within 60 days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rwabukombe, who was mayor of Muvumba in northern Rwanda at the time of the killings, is also accused of ordering a local official to turn away Tutsi refugees seeking shelter in his home, resulting in at least one of the refugees being killed. Rwabukombe was arrested and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-rwanda-mayor-with-genocide.php">charges were filed in Frankfurt</a> [JURIST report] in July.

United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] and <span class="casename">The Boeing Company v. United States</span> on the ability of the government, under the Fourteenth Amendment's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], to keep a claim against a party after invoking the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+state+secrets">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive] and preventing that party from defending the claim. General Dynamics and Boeing had a contract with the government to build a version of the "stealth" fighter plane, but failed to meet the terms of the agreement, prompting the government to end the contract. The companies claimed that they could not complete the work because the Navy refused to release access to secret technology about the "stealth" fighter under the state secrets doctrine. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/07-5111.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Navy was justified in canceling the contract because the companies were not fulfilling their contractual obligations. Counsel for the government argued that the "state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at most only when the party that is relying on secret information is trying to use the Federal court to alter the legal status quo." Counsel for General Dynamics argued that the government is unable to prove that the contractor defaulted on the contract, meaning that the government terminated the contract for convenience and the company should keep the money paid for the partially performed services. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1205.pdf">Smith v. Bayer Corp.</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on two issues. First, under the re-litigation exception of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002283----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [28 USC &#167; 2283], whether a district court can prohibit parties from seeking class certification in state court after denying certification to a similar class, and when the parties and claims are not identical to those in the state court action. Second, whether the district court has personal jurisdiction over absent class members that would allow the court to prevent them from requesting class certification in state court. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BayerOpinionBelow.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the re-litigation exception permitted an injunction preventing parties denied class certification in district court from seeking class certification in state court. The court also held that the protections available to absent class members in the context of an adverse class certification ruling satisfy due process and are sufficient to bind them to the district court's decision. Counsel for the petitioners argued that his clients, individuals who were not named in the district court class action, should not be precluded by the district court's decision: <blockquote>They never received notice of that prior proceeding; they never received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never received an opportunity to appeal the decision denied by certification. No precedent of this Court would justify treating ... people as parties under preclusion principles under these circumstances.</blockquote>Counsel for Bayer argued that the petitioners had "adequate representation," despite lacking "notice and opportunity to be heard," and should be bound by the district court's judgment. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-179.pdf">Stern v. Marshall</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to adjudicate proof of claims. The case revisits the <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/supreme-court-rules-for-anna-nicole.php">estate battle</a> [JURIST report] of model Anna Nicole Smith (Vickie Lynn Marshall). The US Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/19/02-56002.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the bankruptcy court exceeded its jurisdiction in ruling on the case. The case had returned to the Ninth Circuit after the Supreme Court's 2006 ruling in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/marvmar.html">Marshall v. Marshall</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/supreme-court-hears-dispute-over.php">report</a>] that federal courts can in some cases decide disputes which involve state probate laws. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to rule on the case under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. Counsel for the respondent argued that court precedent gave the bankruptcy court the proper jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Duvalier underwent several hours of questioning, and, although he was released, he does not have the right to leave Haiti. Duvalier <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12208109">returned to Haiti</a> [BBC report] from exile in France on Sunday, stating that he had come to offer assistance to help the country recover from last year's <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive]. On Monday, <a HREF = "http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for Haitian authorities to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-authorities-urged-to-prosecute-former-president.php">prosecute</a> [JURIST report] Duvalier for human rights violations committed during his time in office. AI claimed Duvalier and his regime committed acts of "systematic torture," including the disappearance or execution hundreds of human rights activists and other pro-democracy individuals at the hands of Haiti's armed forces and private militia, "<em>tonton macoutes</em>." There has been no comment from Haitian authorities as to whether Duvalier will eventually be charged on these allegations. Although Duvalier has been officially charged, an anonymous Haitian government official told Reuters that they had <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70H4BJ20110118">not yet decided to prosecute</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Last February, the <a href = "http://www.bger.ch/fr/index/federal.htm">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] announced that $4.6 million seized from Duvalier's Swiss bank account <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/switzerland-court-orders-return-of.php">must be returned to his family</a> [JURIST report]. The decision came after the <a href = "http://www.bstger.ch/index.asp?idL=fr">Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] rejected the family's claim to Duvalier's money, which was hidden in Swiss banks during his tenure as president. In 2007, Haitian president <A href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4718966.stm">Rene Preval</a> [BBC profile] <a href = "/paperchase/2007/09/haiti-president-vows-to-continue-legal.php">vowed to continue legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Duvalier despite the latter's plea for forgiveness in a recorded message broadcast around the country. Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he succeeded as "president for life." In response to accusations of human rights violations, Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, and has since resided in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and <a href="http://www.cia.gov">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official websites] did not improperly deny a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.htmlf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] request by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] by releasing redacted documents since two FOIA exemptions allowed the DOD to withhold certain information. The ACLU claims that the full versions of the documents contain evidence that the US government abused detainees. Under the exemptions, the government does not have to release information relating to national security that is properly classified according to executive order or information that is specifically excluded from disclosure by a statute. The court rejected ACLU arguments that the information is not subject to the exemptions since it is already widely available to the public, the interrogation techniques allegedly described in the documents are no longer legal, thus not "intelligence sources or methods," and the government cannot classify the observations of detainees. The court found: "The CIA explained with sufficient detail why the withheld information qualifies as 'intelligence sources or methods' and adequately described the potential harm to national security that could result from the information's public disclosure. Nothing in the CIA's affidavit is contradicted by the record and we find no evidence of bad faith by the government." Ben Wizener, an ACLU attorney involved in the case, disagreed Tuesday, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/court-rules-government-can-continue-suppress-detainee-statements-describing-tort-0">stating</a> [press release], "The court's decision undermines the Freedom of Information Act and condones a cover-up. These transcripts are being suppressed not to protect national security, but to shield former government officials from accountability." The court also ruled that a lower court did not err by refusing to review non-redacted versions of the documents.

<p>Tuesday's decision affirmed a 2009 <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv0437-25">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/federal-judge-rules-against-releasing.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website]. The CIA <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/cia-releases-documents-describing.php">released redacted versions</a> [JURIST report] of the transcripts in June 2009.  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to review its 2008 <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv0437-13">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-sides-with-dod-on-foia.php">report</a>] allowing the government to withhold the transcripts in light of subsequent developments, including Barack Obama's executive orders to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-issues-torture-ban-orders-cia.php">end the use of enhanced interrogation techniques</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">close Guantanamo Bay</a> as well as the government's <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">decision to declassify memos</a> [JURIST reports] related to the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file734_34472.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2008 asking the court to compel the government to release the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bosnian authorities claim that Cvetkovic participated in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica Massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] that saw more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims killed over a 10-day period.

Nizeyimana, nicknamed <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/top-rwanda-genocide-suspect-trial-starts-un-court">"Butcher of Butare"</a> [RNW report], faces four counts of genocide, complicity in genocide, and crimes against humanity including rape and other inhumane acts. Specifically, Nizeyimana, while in charge of intelligence and military operations, allegedly exercised authority over soldiers and personnel and was a member of the elite inner circle of late president <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9115483/Habyarimana-Juvenal">Juvenal Habyarimana</a> [Britannica profile]:<blockquote>Nizeyimana is alleged to have planned, incited to commit, ordered, committed, or in some other way aided and abetted the planning, preparation of executions he is charged with. He is also alleged to have known, or had reason to know, that his subordinates were preparing to commit or had committed one or more of the crimes and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measurers (sic) to prevent the said acts from being committed or to punish those who were responsible.</blockquote> The prosecution alleges that Nizeyimana was among officers of the Rwanda Armed Forces who played key roles in the Rwandan genocide. Defense counsel contends that Nizeyimana was not as influential in authorizing the genocide as alleged and that he was not the de facto commander of military forces. Nizeyimana <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/rwanda-genocide-suspect-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges in October 2009 just weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/top-rwandan-genocide-suspect-arrested.php">being arrested</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Nizeyimana was one of four top accused sought by the ICTR in order to complete its mission. The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/un-extends-terms-for-icty-and-ictr.php">extended the terms</a> [JURIST report] for ICTR judges until they complete their cases. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-sg-urges-support-for-rwanda-genocide.php">pledged his ongoing support</a> [JURIST report] for the ICTR and stresses that the international community must continue to combat genocide. The ICTR was established to try genocide suspects for crimes occurring during the 1994 Rwandan conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in which approximately 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, died.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report revealed eight violations that fall under the purview of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court </a> (ICC) [official website] and may be classified as crimes against humanity. The report presented the first quantitative data of human rights violations in Western Myanmar. The data reveals that government and military officials in Myanmar have perpetrated human rights violations against the Chin ethnic nationality. PHR's research suggests that the charges meet the necessary elements for the ICC to conduct an investigation. PHR Deputy Director <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/about/staff-bios/sollom.html">Richard Sollom</a> [official profile] stated: <blockquote>This report reveals extraordinary levels of state and military violence against civilian populations, and many of the violations that we surveyed may constitute crimes against humanity. . .These findings demand not only attention, but action by all who are concerned with Burma's peoples, their well-being, and Burma's future.</blockquote> PHR recommends a full investigation into alleged crimes against humanity and the creation of a judicial system that will allow for offenders to be prosecuted.

<p>PHR's report comes after heavy criticism of Myanmar by both international organizations and human rights groups. In December 2010, a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] expert <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar's military government to release 2,202 political prisoners. The UN official called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," claiming many of them suffered from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. In September 2010, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-group-urges-myanmar-to-free-political-prisoners-before-election.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Myanmar to release all political prisoners ahead of the nation's November elections. Prior to the country's elections, opposition party leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977">Aung San Suu Kyi </a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] was placed under house arrest. Her detention and previous exclusion from the election drew criticism from the UN and various rights groups. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The government <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/health-care-appeal-notice-US.pdf">filed a notice of appeal</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], signaling its intent to challenge Judge Henry Hudson's December <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/12/13/va.healthcare.ruling.pdf">finding</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] that an individual's decision to purchase health insurance is beyond the reach of Congress and outside the purview of the Commerce, Necessary and Proper, General Welfare and Taxation powers enumerated in the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text]. Hudson declined to issue injunctive relief at the time and anticipated the appeal, saying that "the award of declaratory judgment is sufficient to stay the hand of the executive branch pending an appeal." The appeal will proceed before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website], and it is believed that the challenge will eventually advance to the Supreme Court.

<p>Hudson's ruling marked the first time a court struck down part of the health care legislation despite numerous legal challenges. Also in December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">granted a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/casedocumentsnewjerseyphysiciansincetalvobamaetal">lawsuit</a> [case materials] brought by a physician organization challenging the law, and a similar challenge filed by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website].

The <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and joined by <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">more than 20 states</a> [JURIST reports] and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. A week earlier, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AT&#38;T</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] on whether <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_guide09/exemption7c.pdf">exemption 7(C)</a> [DOJ backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552] applies to corporations. Under exemption 7(C), an agency can withhold information pursuant to an FOIA request if that information can reasonably be believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy. The issue of whether a corporation can be considered an individual for FOIA purposes has brought the court's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. FEC</a> [JURIST report] to the fore in the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202462348296&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1">minds of commentators</a> [NLJ report]. The FCC's <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-1279_Petitioner.pdf">argument</a> [brief, PDF] in the matter focuses on the expansive reading of FOIA by the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and that a plain text reading of the statute precludes corporations from qualifying for an exemption for possible invasion of "personal privacy." AT&#38;T <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-1279_Respondent.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that the plain language of the text does include corporations, that FOIA includes corporations in the definition of person and thus "personal privacy" must refer to corporate privacy as well. Justice Antonin Scalia, in the majority in <span class="casename">Citizens United</span>, took issue with AT&#38;T's position, almost from the beginning, saying at one point, <blockquote>"Personal," yes, can indeed apply to corporations sometimes; but there are certain phrases where it certainly does not. For example, you talk about personal characteristics. That doesn't mean the characteristics of General Motors. You talk about personal qualities. It doesn't mean the qualities of General Motors. You talk about a point of personal privilege. It's not a privilege of a corporation. And I think personal privacy is the same thing.</blockquote> Justice Elena Kagan, who signed the petition for <em>certorari</em> as solicitor general, did not take part in the argument and will not take part in the decision.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1273.pdf">Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa Clara County</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a federal court can utilize common law to provide a private cause of action under a federal statute that provides no such right. Under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00000256---b000-.html">Public Health Service Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 256b], drug manufacturers must enter into contracts with the federal government that restrict the price that those manufacturers can charge to providers through the Medicaid system. The statute is silent on the topic of a private cause of action, but the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that federal common law does in fact provide a cause of action under contract law where a third party beneficiary is injured by the drug manufacturer's breach. Astra <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-1273_Petitioner.pdf">argues</a> [brief, PDF] that only Congress can provide a cause of action under a federal statute, and that this circumvention of Congressional intent will disrupt the statutory scheme and the Medicaid system. The county <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-1273_Respondent.pdf">argues</a> [brief, PDF] that as third-party beneficiaries, health care providers are entitled to enforce contracts and that such enforcement is necessary given the lack of oversight by the Federal government. During the course of the argument, counsel for Astra engaged in an exchange with Justice Stephen Breyer, which seemingly advanced the county's argument that private enforcement is needed, <blockquote>JUSTICE BREYER: So what is Santa Clara County supposed do? They think they're being overcharged. And in your opinion -- the company doesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do if they're right? How do they get the money ... I'm interested in procedurally what are they supposed to do?<br />
MS. BLATT: Oh, pick up the phone and either call the manufacturer, the prime vendor -<br />
JUSTICE BREYER: The manufacturer says: Okay, you're wrong; I'm not; I'm undercharging you. Now what happens?<br />
MS. BLATT: Ultimately, if they can't get the Secretary to -<br />
JUSTICE BREYER: He's busy.<br />
MS. BLATT: If she's busy and won't return the calls, Congress said: You can't enforce it.</blockquote> As with <span class="casename">FCC v. AT&#38;T</span>, Kagan will take no part in the decision of this matter. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, two Caucasian students, were denied undergraduate admission to UT in 2008, and subsequently challenged UT's admissions policy, which allows the university to consider race and ethnicity during admissions processing. The court found that the policy did not violate the plaintiffs' rights to equal protection under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] and federal civil rights statutes. The court affirmed the holding of the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] that UT's policy was consistent with the 2003 US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZS.html">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> [opinion, text; JURIST <a href="/forum/symposium-aa/index-printer.php">commentary</a>]:<blockquote>Their [universities'] holistic approach is part of a forward-looking effort to obtain the educational benefits of diversity. The look to race as but one element of this further goal, coupled with individualized consideration, steers university admissions away from a quota system. <em>Grutter</em> teaches that so long as a university considers race in a holistic and individualized manner, and not as part of a quota or fixed-point system, courts must afford a measure of deference to the university's good faith determination that certain race-conscious measures are necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity, including attaining critical mass in minority enrollment.</blockquote> The court concluded that UT could rely on race as one of the "special circumstances" used to evaluate student applicants because race is one of many factors the university considers.

<p>Affirmative action continues to be a controversial issue. In August, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] held that a state ban on preferential hiring practices for minorities and women <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-high-court-rules-affirmative-action-ban-constitutional.php">does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the federal <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text]. In April 2009, California <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="http://equaljusticesociety.org/email/AG_LetterBrief_209_20090422.pdf">said</a> [opinion letter, PDF] that portions of <a href="http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/209text.htm">Proposition 209</a> [text], an amendment to the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California Constitution</a> [text] banning the use of affirmative action for state hiring, contracting, or university admission, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/california-ag-calls-amendment-banning.php">may violate the US Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2008, Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ballot-measure-fails.php">voters narrowly rejected</a> [JURIST report] a ballot <a href="http://www.elections.colorado.gov/DDefault.aspx?tid=1036">measure</a> [Amendment 46 text and materials] to prohibit governmental agencies from discriminating or granting preferences on the basis of race and sex. A nearly identical <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ban-passed-in.php">measure passed</a> [JURIST report] in Nebraska. In 2006, Michigan voters <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a similar state constitutional amendment, which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/michigan-affirmative-action-ban-ruled.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008 by a federal district judge in a lawsuit alleging that such an affirmative action ban violated the US Constitution.<br />

Nelson</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-nasa-background-checks-evidence.php">report</a>] and upheld the background checks that NASA uses for employees of companies working under contract. In 2008 the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] held that the government violates a federal contract employee's constitutional right to informational privacy when it asks in the course of a background investigation whether the employee has received counseling or treatment for illegal drug use and when it asks the employee's designated references for any adverse information that may have a bearing on the employee's suitability for employment at a federal facility. NASA has been conducting background checks of employees since it was founded in 1958, but contract employees were only included after the agency revised its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/privacy/PIA_NASA_Security_Records_System.html">Security Program Procedural Requirements</a> [official backgrounder] in 2006. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the opinion for the court, stated that the government has an interest in conducting basic employment background checks to ensure "the security of its facilities and in employing a competent, reliable work-force." Furthermore, the investigations were the same as the standard background checks given to civil servants, and both contract employees and civil servants preform "functionally equivalent duties." Due to the reasonableness of the inquiries and recently-enacted security provisions, the government did not have a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its questions are "necessary" or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests, and, therefore, did not violate a constitutional right to information privacy. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas also filed his own opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the decision.

<p>The case arose in 2007 when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> [official website] began requiring background checks for all contract employees, including low-risk employees at the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) [official website]. A group of 28 employees filed suit seeking an injunction, but their claims were rejected by the District Court. Counsel for NASA argued, "the background checks' mere collection of information with accompanying safeguards vitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These checks have been going on for millions of employees for dozens of years. They are part of the employment process. They are manifestly not roving checks on random individuals." Counsel for the respondents argued that the background checks violate their rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/afghanistan-president-orders-tribunal-to-handle-parliamentary-election-complaints.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST report] in December authorizing the country's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.af/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to review all issues with the election including allegations of criminal fraud and intimidation at the polls. The five-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-high-court-to-investigate-election-complaints-possibly-changing-results.php">announced earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] that they would issue rulings in time for Karzai to seat the parliament as scheduled. The announcement of a further delay has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/19/AR2011011904034.html">raised concerns</a> [WP report] that the Afghan government is looking for ways to challenge the validity of the election results. The tumultuous elections resulted in many of Karzai's supporters being ousted from the government and have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70I4BH20110119">led to questions concerning the credibility</a> [Reuters] of the government. Candidates who were removed from office in the elections have warned that unfair rulings by the panel could <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/world/asia/20afghan.html">result in increased violence</a> [NYT report], while winning candidates have threatened violent protests if the election results are overturned. Karzai has assured that the delay will not go beyond February 22, which would mean that Afghanistan had been without a parliament for more than five months. The Afghan parliament was originally scheduled to be seated on January 23 and there is fear that further delays will lead to instability in the region. 

<p>The September parliamentary elections irregularities have raised doubts over the ability of the Afghan government to lead. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php">disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Elections Commission</a> (IEC) [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] of Karzai was also marred by fraud allegations, leading to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/afghanistan-parliament-backs.php">attempts by the government</a> [JURIST report] to reform the ECC. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In August, piracy charges against Ibrahim and five other defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">Kenya</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Richter</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-to-consider-removal.php">report</a>] that the section of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002254----000-.html">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [28 USC &#167; 2254 text] limiting federal review of state court decisions to decisions resulting from an unreasonable application of the law or an unreasonable determination of the facts is applicable to state court orders issued without an accompanying explanation. In an 8-0 decision, the court held that, where a state court's decision is not accompanied by an opinion stating the court's reasoning, the petitioner seeking <em>habeas corpus</em> relief still bears the burden of proving there was not reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief. In its decision, the court also reaffirmed the standard established in <span class="casename">Strickland v. Washington</span> for determining the effectiveness of assistance of counsel at trial. The court held that, in order for a person to be successful on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, they must prove that their representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" and that the failure of counsel resulted in prejudice. During oral arguments, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-vaccine-lawsuits.php">respondent argued</a> [JURIST report] that defense counsel's reliance on cross-examination in lieu of forensic evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the court, rejected the petitioners argument stating that there are "countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case" and that counsel is given wide latitude to make "tactical decisions" and still remain within the "wide range of reasonable professional assistance." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored a concurring opinion in which she stated that she did not believe the defense counsel provided the assistance guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, but that counsel's lapse was not "so serious as to deprive Richter of a fair trial." The court overturned the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/08/10/06-15614.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in the case by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the ruling. 

<p>Kennedy also authored Wednesday's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-658.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-658">Premo v. Moore</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], which reversed a Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/07/29/04-15713.pdf">grant of <em>habeas</em> relief</a> [opinion, PDF] for ineffective assistance of counsel. Respondent Randy Moore filed the petition for relief on the basis that defense counsel failed to move to suppress a confession that may have been obtained illegally prior to advising him to accept a plea agreement. In an 8-0 decision, the court again applied the <span class="casename">Strickland</span> standard, holding that the defense counsel's representation was objectively reasonable. The court stated that it was reasonable for the state court to accept the defense counsel's explanation that a motion to suppress would have been pointless in light of additional admissible statements of guilt by Moore. The court also rejected the Ninth Circuit's application of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-839.ZO.html">Arizona v. Fulminante</a> [opinion text] to the instant case, stating that <span class="casename">Fulminante</span> cannot be read as applying to the <span class="casename">Strickland</span> standard of effectiveness of counsel. Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion in the case. Kagan took no part in the decision.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Statements from <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/lithuania-must-reopen-cia-secret-prison-investigation-2011-01-18">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2011_01_19lithuaniadropstorturesiteinquiry">Reprieve</a> [press releases] say that Friday's <a href="http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/27756/">decision to stop the investigation</a> [<em>Baltic Times</em> report] was premature. AI says that it has a "dossier of information relevant to the investigation" it was planning to send to investigators this week, and will now do so along with a letter requesting that the criminal probe be reopened. Northwestern Law professor <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/JosephMargulies/">Joe Margulies</a> [academic profile], counsel for an alleged CIA torture victim, said in the Reprieve press release that "[t]he Prosecutor is trying to deflect blame for the failure of his investigation onto NGOs and the media. It's ironic that an official investigation into a secret torture facility should claim to be thwarted because the media is insufficiently transparent."

<p>In 2009, the Lithuanian Parliament National Security Committee reported that the CIA had established secret prisons for al Qaeda suspects in the Baltic country. Lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/lithuania-lawmakers-demand.php">demanded the investigation</a> [JURIST report] after ABC News reported that former CIA officials said that Lithuania provided the CIA with facilities for a secret prison for high-value al Qaeda suspects in order to improve relations with the US. The parliamentary committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department provided the CIA with two secret facilities, but it is unclear whether either facility was used to interrogate detainees. Lithuanian <a href="http://www.urm.lt/index.php?1228187259">Foreign Minister Vygaudas Usackas</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/lithuania-foreign-minister-resigns-amid.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] last January in the midst of a dispute with <a href="http://www.president.lt/en/institution/president_dalia_grybauskaite_399/biography.html">President Dalia Grybauskaite</a> [official profile] over whether the prisons were in the country. Grybauskaite has publicly said that she believes there were prisoners held in Lithuania, but Usackas has denied this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Obama administration had been seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed on the basis of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], but Judge Claudia Wilken <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/19/BACC1HBOSN.DTL&tsp=1">allowed the lawsuit to proceed</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report]. Under DOMA, same-sex couples legally married in the state are prevented from accessing the federal rights and benefits afforded to opposite-sex spouses, including the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration, the right to Social Security survivors benefits, the right to health insurance from a spouse who is federally employed and the right to jointly file income taxes. Three employees of the University of California - San Francisco filed the lawsuit because the Public Employees' Retirement System said it would <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2011%2F01%2F19%2Fstate%2Fn230951S12.DTL">not enroll their same-sex spouses</a> [AP report] in a federally approved long-term care program.

<p>In August, the California Senate voted <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ajr_19_vote_20100823_0123PM_sen_floor.html">22-12</a> [roll call vote] in favor of a <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ajr_19_bill_20090831_amended_asm_v97.html">joint resolution</a> [AJR 19 text] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-lawmakers-urge-federal-government-to-repeal-doma.php">urge the federal government to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report]. In July, DOMA was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by a Massachusetts federal judge in two separate cases. In one case, Judge Joseph Tauro held that the DOMA violated the principles of equal protection embodied in the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause as a matter of law. In the other case, Tauro <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Cago/docs/civilrights/DOMA%20Decision.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that the DOMA violates states' Tenth Amendment right to define marriage.

Montas, who worked for the UN under Ban-Ki Moon, as well as Alix Fils-Aime and Claude and Nicole Magloire, allege that Duvalier committed <a href="http://haitipress.net63.net/?p=4938">crimes against humanity</a> [HUP report, in French]. The four were allegedly <a href="http://www.lenouvelliste.com/article.php?PubID=1&ArticleID=88016&PubDate=2011-01-19#Suite">imprisoned and subjected to torture</a> [<em>Le Nouvelliste</em> report, in French] during Duvalier's presidency. Three of them were forced into exile. On Tuesday, Duvalier was briefly detained and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-files-theft-and-corruption-charges-against-former-president-duvalier.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with corruption, embezzlement and a number of other crimes. Although Duvalier was officially charged, an anonymous Haitian government official told Reuters that they had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70H4BJ20110118">not yet decided to prosecute</a> [Reuters report]. Duvalier's lawyers have reacted to the complaints claiming their client in the target of government persecution. Duvalier returned suddenly to Haiti from exile in France this past Sunday and has expressed a <a href="http://radiokiskeya.com/spip.php?article7427">desire to become president</a> [Radio Kiskeya report, in French] of Haiti again. 

<p>Last February, the <a href="http://www.bger.ch/fr/index/federal.htm">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] announced that $4.6 million seized from Duvalier's Swiss bank account <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/switzerland-court-orders-return-of.php">must be returned to his family</a> [JURIST report]. The decision came after the <a href="http://www.bstger.ch/index.asp?idL=fr">Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in French] rejected the family's claim to Duvalier's money, which was hidden in Swiss banks during his tenure as president. In 2007, Haitian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4718966.stm">Rene Preval</a> [BBC profile] vowed to <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/haiti-president-vows-to-continue-legal.php">continue legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Duvalier despite the latter's plea for forgiveness in a recorded message broadcast around the country. Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he succeeded as "president for life." In response to accusations of human rights violations, Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, and has since resided in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [official website] and two of her aids, Ronald Barber and Pamela Simon. The January 8 attack, launched on an open meeting of Giffords' constituency outside a Tuscon Safeway, took the lives of six people.  Loughner faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for the attempted assassination of Giffords. Each count of attempted murder of a federal employee carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. US Attorney <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/az/meettheattorney.html">Dennis Burke</a> [official biography] of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/az/">District of Arizona</a> [official website] said the investigation is still in its "early stages":<blockquote>This case involves...death-penalty charges, and Department [of Justice] rules require us to pursue a deliberate and thorough process. Today's charges are just the beginning of our legal action. We are working diligently to ensure that our investigation is thorough and that justice is done for the victims in their families.</blockquote> Loughner has been in custody without bail since January 8.

<p>Last week, a California federal judge was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-appointed-to-hear-arizona-shooting-case.php">appointed</a> [JURIST news report] to try the case after all federal judges in Arizona recused themselves due to objectivity concerns arising from the death <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2011/01/09/victim-profile-john-roll-63-arizona-federal-judge/">John Roll</a> [WSJ profile], Chief Judge of the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website].

The church later <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/01/12/20110112arizona-shooting-church-agrees-not-to-protest.html">backed off its plans</a> [Arizona Republic report] and did not hold a protest.  Prosecutors <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ic/pdf/arizona-gifford-charges-filed.pdf">charged Loughner</a> [criminal complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">report</a>] with murder and attempted murder last week.  President Barack Obama has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/01/08/president-speaks-shootings-tucson-we-are-going-get-bottom-and-we-re-going-get-throug">directed</a> that the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/news_blog/arizona_010811">investigation into the shooting be conducted</a> [press releases] by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] under the coordination of <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/executives/director">Director Robert Mueller</a> [official profile].  Officials arrested Loughner on January 8 and continue to search for a <a href="http://pimasheriff.org/files/9912/9456/4787/Attempt_to_Identify.pdf">possible accomplice</a> [press release].  Due to the polarized political climate, many suspect that the attack was <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/01/the-note-arizona-shooting-touches-off-fierce-debate-over-political-rhetoric.html">politically motivated</a> [ABC report]. Giffords has received harsh criticism in Arizona for her vote for the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Health+Care">news archive</a>] and was among those members of Congress who reported threats or vandalism in 2010. Giffords also was an outspoken critic of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>].

During a daily briefing, UN Special Advisor on Genocide <a href = "http://www.unelections.org/files/IGP_BiographyofFrancisDeng_30May07.pdf">Francis Deng</a> [official profile, PDF] and Special Advisor on the Responsibility to Protect <a href = "http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/directory/ecl2002-fac.html">Edward Luck</a> [academic profile] discussed their fears for the nation and drew comparisons between the current situation in the Ivory Coast and the international community's failure to prevent the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Rwanda+Genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive], as well as successful preventive measures in Kenya. The pair echoed warnings they gave last month that the UN has received unconfirmed reports of <a href="http://www.un.org/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/Special%20Advisers%27%20Statement%20on%20Cote%20d%27Ivoire,%2029%20.12.2010.pdf">serious human rights violations</a> [press release, PDF], specifically alleging that supporters and special forces of President <A href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] are inciting violence among different ethnic groups for political purposes. Also Wednesday, the UN Security Council unanimously authorized 2,000 <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37311&Cr=ivoire&Cr1">additional peacekeeping troops</a> [UN News Centre report; <a href = "http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/unifeed/d/16804.html">press briefing</a>] in the African nation after reports of continued violence between opposing political forces and against UN peacekeepers.

<p>The UN <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/un-pledges-to-defend-Ouattara-and-warns-of-consequences-for-war-crimes-in-ivory-coast.php">pledged support</a> [JURIST report] for president-elect <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] in January, committing UN peacekeeping forces to his aid. The UN also noted reports of <a href = "http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/15206">mass graves</a> [Newstime Africa report], and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href = "http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] warned Gbagbo that he would be held accountable for continued post-election violence carried out in his name. Ouattara defeated Gbagbo in a runoff election in November, but Gbagbo has refused to concede defeat or leave office. During the ensuing violence, hundreds were arrested and dozens allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment. UN officials have <A href = "/paperchase/2010/12/un-urges-parties-to-prevent-ethnic-crimes-in-post-election-ivory-coast.php">pleaded</a> [JURIST report] for all parties to the disputed presidential election to honor the country's commitment to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity under the <a href = "http://www.un.org/summit2005/presskit/fact_sheet.pdf">2005 World Summit Outcome Document</a> [text, PDF].

Danielle Chiesi was accused of communicating non-public information about <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.amd.com">Advanced Microdevices</a> (AMD) and <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Sun Microsystems</a> (now Sun-Oracle) [corporate websites] in 2008 and 2009 to her superiors at <a href="http://investment-advisors.findthebest.com/detail/11118/NEW-CASTLE-FUNDS-LLC">New Castle Funds LLC</a> [fund profile], a Manhattan-based investment advisory company formerly part of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/bear_stearns_companies/index.html">Bear Stearns</a> [NYT backgrounder].  Chiesi was arrested in 2009 along with Galleon founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive] and accused of using the information to reap more than $4 million in illegal profits for New Castle.  Her attorney claims she never traded on her own account using the information, and that the actual take was considerably lower. New Castle is said to have gained at least $1.7 million from the trades. Chiesi reportedly got the information from former IBM executive Robert Moffat, with whom she was having an affair.  Moffat is currently serving six months in prison for insider trading in connection with the Galleon case.  While each count carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and fines as much as double the gross gain from the offense, Chiesi is said to have signed a plea bargain that will limit her confinement to 46 months at most.  US Attorney Preet Bharara lauded the development:<blockquote>Today, Danielle Chiesi admitted to exploiting her access to valuable, non-public information to reap $1.7 million in illegal gains. By sharing and conspiring to trade on inside information, Chiesi compromised the companies she sold out and distorted the market for their stocks. Today's plea should send yet another strong message that we have zero tolerance for privileged professionals who game the system and who think the rules apply only to everyone else.</blockquote>Rajaratnam's trial in what has been called the biggest insider trading investigation in history is set start on February 28, also before Judge Holwell.

<p>Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010 and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after he <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] the previous March. Former <a href="http://www.intel.com/about/companyinfo/capital/index.htm">Intel Capital</a> [corporate website] executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in connection with the Galleon probe earlier in February. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December after being indicted for insider trading.<br />

The <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/6.html">ruling</a> [text] invalidates two European patents held by IPCom, for which the company had sought substantial compensation from Nokia. In reaching its decision, the court described IPCom's litigation tactics as an "abuse of process" designed to improperly prolong the proceedings. IPCom has had <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-20/nokia-wins-london-appeals-court-ruling-invalidating-two-ipcom-patents.html">13 additional patents nullified</a> [Bloomberg report] as a result of four prior UK suits involving Nokia, and arguments between the companies pertaining to an unrelated divisional patent are scheduled for April.

<p>In December, Nokia filed <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/nokia-sues-apple-in-europe-for-patent-infringement.php">13 patent infringement complaints</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. The complaints join 24 patent claims already filed by Nokia against Apple in US courts.

Per the report, administration officials plan to rescind an order issued on Obama's first day in office that <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">halted military commission proceedings</a> [JURIST report] and continues to block the government from initiating new cases under the system. If done, filings are expected within weeks, which would represent the first time that new charges are brought against detainees during the Obama administration. Officials are also reportedly drafting a new executive order that would establish mechanisms by which to review the cases of those detainees held without trial.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] in April released a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d2010manual.pdf">manual</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pentagon-releases-manual-for-military.php">report</a>] for military commission procedures under the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF]. The manual established the rules of evidence and procedure for the commissions, allowing for the admission of certain hearsay evidence and defining "material support" for terrorism. The release came a month after <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-appoints-top.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] retired Navy <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] as the convening authority for military commissions. The position oversees military commissions themselves as well as the Office of Military Commissions and, notably, has the power to review and approve charges against "belligerents" pursuant to the Military Commissions Act.  UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] in March urged the administration to abandon military commissions, calling the system <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">"fatally flawed"</a> [JURIST report] and beyond hope of reform. Scheinin's comments followed shortly after reports emerged indicating that the administration was considering <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">trying specific suspects in military courts</a> [JURIST report] rather than through the civilian justice system. In May 2009, unidentified sources revealed that the administration would pursue a broad <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/obama-may-continue-military-commission.php">reinstitution of the commission system</a> [JURIST report] due to concerns about the viability of trying terror suspects in federal courts and, in particular, of meeting federal evidentiary standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the last five weeks, more than 100 people have died from live fire, protest suicides and prison riots, according to Pillay's office. Tunisia Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Radhouanne Nouicer has agreed to the UN human rights mission. The interim government also has plans to set up its own human rights commissions: two Commissions inquiring into human rights abuses and corruption and a Commission on political reform. Pillay urged that justice and fair trials be strengthened and not undermined by violence, stating: <blockquote>Human rights lie at the heart of the extraordinary developments which culminated in the departure of former President Ben Ali. We all hope this will be the beginning of a new Tunisia, where people are free to go about their lives without fear of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture or other forms of abuse.</blockquote>Historically, Tunisia has a poor human rights reputation. A 2009 report by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] detailed Tunisia's continued <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE30/010/2009/en/5215d731-d6ec-4a2d-ad72-ab8244c7040e/mde300102009eng.pdf">violations of human rights</a> [report, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/tunisia-continues-to-violate-human.php">report</a>] despite previous vows to cease.

<p>On Monday, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] urged government leaders in Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-secretary-general-calls-on-leaders-in-tunisia-to-restore-rule-of-law.php">initiate dialogue</a> [JURIST report] between all sides in an attempt to restore rule of law. The Tunisia Constitutional Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">officially announced</a> [JURIST report] last week that <a href="http://www.carthage.tn/en/index.php">President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [official website] had permanently left the office of the president. The council, the country's highest legal authority on constitutional issues, declared that the leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, will <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/January/middleeast_January262.xml&section=middleeast">assume power</a> [AFP report] until elections are held in two months. The council made its ruling at the request of <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] and based its ruling on article 57 of the constitution, declaring a "definitive" vacation of the presidency. Before flying out of Tunis to seek refuge in Saudi Arabia, Ben Ali signed a decree granting interim presidential powers to Ghannouchi, attempting to leave open the possibility of returning to office. Mebezza <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111513513854222.html">took the oath of office</a> [Al Jazeera report] on Saturday and according to the council he should organize new presidential elections within 60 days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The company is challenging the regulations, which would prevent Internet providers from selectively blocking web access, saying they "go beyond any authority provided by Congress." The new net neutrality rules were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-approves-net-neutrality-rules.php">approved last month</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website], and the controversy surrounding the regulations suggested <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703581204576033513990668654.html">legal challenges would be pursued</a> [WSJ report]. In its statement, Verizon says the suit "is the result of a careful review of the FCC's order. We are deeply concerned by the FCC's assertion of broad authority for sweeping new regulation of broadband networks and the Internet itself." Advocacy groups, however, are <a href="http://www.mediaaccess.org/2011/01/verizon&#8217;s-net-neutrality-&#8220;appeal&#8221;-is-blatant-appeals-court-forum-shopping/">accusing Verizon of forum shopping</a> and sacrificing equal Internet network accessibility in order to <a href="http://www.freepress.net/press-release/2011/1/20/free-press-even-weak-watered-down-rule-not-enough-appease-verizon">make a profit</a> [press releases]. FCC Chairman <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-proposes-new-rules-for-internet-regulation.php">proposed the rules</a> [JURIST report] last month has not yet responded to the appeal.

<p>The FCC has long been trying to exert more control over Internet regulation. Last year, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] introduced <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/demint.net.neutrality.bill.072110.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF; JURIST report] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] found that the FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality.

Magnitsky was arrested after <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/20/AR2011012005687.html">implicating Russian police</a> [WP report] in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal, while working as outside counsel for the London-based investment fund <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Management</a> [corporate website]. Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. It is suspected that torture played a part in his death. Bowder has accused the police of murdering Magnitsky in an effort to conceal their role in the embezzlement scheme and has enlisted the help of <a href="http://www.redress.org/smartweb/home/home">Redress</a> [advocacy website], a British organization that works on behalf of torture victims. It is at Redress' request that the UN has decided to launch the investigation.

<p>In September, US lawmakers introduced a <a href="http://cardin.senate.gov/pdfs/magnitsky.pdf">bill</a> [press release, PDF] that would prohibit the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] from issuing visas to individuals, or their family members, connected to the death of Magnitsky. In addition to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-lawmakers-seek-to-ban-visas-for-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">visa restrictions</a> [JURIST report], the bill would also prohibit the transaction of property or finances through US financial institutions by officials implicated in Magnitsky's death. <a href="http://cardin.senate.gov/">Senator Benjamin Cardin</a> (D-MD) [official website], who introduced the bill, said it was necessary for the US to take action because the Russian judicial system had failed to hold anyone accountable for Magnitsky's death. Cardin noted the bill's importance in protecting US business interests abroad and sending "a strong message to those who are currently acting with impunity in Russia that there will be consequences for corruption should you wish to travel and invest abroad." Cardin originally urged the DOS to take action on the visas in a <a href="http://shots.snap.com/explore/64936/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csce.gov%2Findex.cfm%3FFuseaction%3DFiles.Download%26FileStore_id%3D1732&key=f2468b611a9662be5d1a45c03a46bdb8&src=&cp=&tol=url">letter</a> [text, PDF] he submitted in April to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In addition to the letter, Cardin provided a <a href="http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Files.Download&FileStore_id=1744">list of 60 senior officials</a> [text, PDF] in the Russian government and their connection to the death of Magnitsky.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While details are somewhat unclear, the UN believes that Mexican officials stopped a freight train headed north in Oaxaca, detained approximately 90 migrants, and allowed the remaining individuals to continue on the train. Soon after, armed individuals boarded the train and abducted 40 of the migrants. Pillay called for a transparent investigation into the treatment of those individuals detained by the Mexican authorities, as well as the circumstances that led to the armed abduction so soon after authorities allowed the train to continue, saying: <blockquote>The Mexican authorities need to ascertain whether or not any state officials, including those working for the state-owned train operator, were complicit with the criminal organization that carried out the abductions and extortion, both in this and other cases.</blockquote>Pillay also condemned the threats directed at Father Alejandro Solalinde, one of Mexico's most prominent defenders of migrant rights.

<p>The human rights environment in Mexico has deteriorated significantly over the past decade, as the <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/mexico-drug-war/#/its-a-war">Mexican Drug War</a> [LAT backgrounder] has increased in severity. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) set up an office in Mexico in 2002 and since that time has released <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?c=119&su=123">numerous reports</a> [OHCHR database] documenting Mexico's struggle in the areas of education, rights of indigenous people and immigrant rights. While <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/mexico-president-criticizes-arizona.php">Mexico has condemned</a> [JURIST report] Arizona's attempts to curb immigration into the US through the controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1070</a> [bill materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], activists believe that Mexican immigration laws are <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/05/26/Activists-Mexicos-immigration-laws-tough/UPI-65801274892569/">even more restrictive</a> [UPI report], and that immigrants to Mexico <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/014/2010/en/8459f0ac-03ce-4302-8bd2-3305bdae9cde/amr410142010eng.pdf">routinely face abuse and harassment</a> [AI report, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In July, Naseer was one of five men <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-announces-charges-against-al-qaeda-members-for-nyc-subway-bomb-plot.php">indicted on terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for his alleged involvement in the September 2009 New York City <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-announces-indictment-of-suspected.php">subway bomb plot</a> [JURIST news archive]. Naseer was arrested in the UK in response to a US request that he stand trial for his alleged attempts to plant bombs in New York, Norway and the UK. Naseer's lawyers have fought his extradition to the US citing concerns that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12254739">US may attempt to deport him</a> [BBC report] to his native country of Pakistan. Their concerns are supported by a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-to-review-rights-act-after-terror-suspects-avoid-deportation.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] issued in May by the UK <a href="http://www.siac.tribunals.gov.uk/">Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> [official website], which concluded that it was not possible for Naseer to be deported to Pakistan without facing torture or death. In his ruling, Judge Quentin Purdy <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hl_uRlIBaNOifeHIPMKFOlhixpbA?docId=CNG.603f0a54fe27765e702c2354a10cae3b.481">acknowledged concerns</a> [AFP report] regarding Naseer's possible removal to Pakistan, but ultimately rejected the argument stating that the US court system protects the due process rights of all people subject to its jurisdiction. Before Naseer's extradition becomes official, it must be approved by the British Home Secretary. Naseer's lawyers have indicated that they plan to appeal the ruling. 

<p>Naseer is unlikely to face extradition until the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] rules on a similar series of extradition cases that are currently before the court. In July, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">stayed the extradition of four terrorism suspects</a> [JURIST report] from the UK to the US, holding that potential punishment could violate <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art5">Human Rights Convention</a> [text] provisions on the prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment. The suspects include British citizens Haroon Rashid Aswat, Seyla Talha Ahsan and <a href="http://www.freebabarahmad.com/">Babar Ahmad</a> [advocacy website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4441680.stm">profile</a>] and Egyptian-born radical Muslim cleric <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11701269">Abu Hamza al-Masri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abu+Hamza+al-Masri">news archive</a>]. All four men are wanted in the US on terrorism charges. The UK High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of.php">approved the extradition of Aswat and Ahmad</a> to the US in 2006, while the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of-jailed.php">extradition of Hamza was approved</a> [JURIST reports] by a British court in 2007. The ECHR is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7878690/Abu-Hamza-extradition-halted-by-EU-judges.html">reconsidering the evidence</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] against the men and trying to determine if the US sentencing standards would lead to an Article 3 violation of the suspects' human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his ruling, Judge Lewis Kaplan stated that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to allow the jury to find Ghailani a "knowing and willing participation" in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombing</a> [PBS backgrounder] of two US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, in which 12 Americans and 212 others were killed. The defense had argued that the conviction was inconsistent with the fact that that the jury <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/nyregion/18ghailani.html?_r=1">exonerated the defendant</a> [NYT report] on 284 other counts but convicted him on one charge of conspiracy. Ghailani is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70K5GQ20110121">scheduled to be sentenced next week</a> [Reuters report] and faces a minimum of 20 years in prison. 

<p>In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-court-hears-opening-statements-in-ex-guantanamo-detainees-civilian-trial.php">court first heard arguments in the Ghailani trial</a> [JURIST report], the first civilian trial of a former Guantanamo Bay detainee. An attorney for Ghailani argued during the opening statements that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] took advantage of Ghailani's youth and that Ghailani was unaware of the terrorists' criminal plans. In July, Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-charges-against-ex-guantanamo-detainee.php">refused to dismiss charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ghailani ruling that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was not violated. Ghailani's lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-seek.php">sought a dismissal</a> of charges, arguing that he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-argue.php">denied the right to a speedy trial</a> [JURIST reports] while being detained for nearly five years in CIA secret prisons and later at Guantanamo Bay. Earlier in July, Kaplan ruled that Ghailani was not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and was therefore <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-rules-former-guantanamo-detainee-fit-to-stand-trial.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Canadian Edgar Bronfman Jr., former vice-chairman of Vivendi and current Warner Music Group chairman and CEO, was convicted of insider trading and fined five million euros. Both Messier and Bronfman received <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70K2XY20110121">suspended prison sentences</a> [Reuters report] of three years and 15 months respectively. Messier embarked on a monolithic acquisition spree from 1996 to 2002, which transformed a French water utility, Generale des Eaux, into a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110121/ap_on_en_ot/eu_france_vivendi_trial">massive multimedia conglomerate</a> [AP report]. Messier was forced out in 2002 after giving upbeat reports about Vivendi finances while the company was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12254030">struggling to avoid collapse under 35 billion euros in debt</a> [BBC report]. Vivendi shares dropped more than 80 percent in value as the company amassed debt. Both Messier and Bronfman have indicated they intend to appeal the conviction.

<p>Last January, a fedearl jury in New York found Vivendi liable on 57 counts of <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vivendi-found-liable-for-securities.php">violating US federal securities laws</a> [JURIST report] but exonerated Messier. Messier testified that the fall in stock price was not due to securities fraud but because of the economic climate. In 2004, the <a href="http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/ex-managers-get-suspended-jail-in-french-vivendi-trial_124759.html">French stock market regulator fined Messier</a> [Expatica report] one million euros, which was later reduced by an appeals court to 500,00 euros. In 2003, Vivendi paid a $50 million fine to the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] to settle the complaint. Messier paid a $1 million fine and agreed to give up his claim to a 20 million euro severance payment. <a href="/paperchase/2004/01/vivendi-withdraws-lawsuit-against.htm">Vivendi had previously sued Messier</a> [JURIST report] to recover the severance payment, claiming that board members had been coerced by Messier into signing off on the payment, but later withdrew its lawsuit as part of the settlement with the SEC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor appealed the original verdict on the grounds that the lower court "erroneously and incompletely established the state of facts" leading it to misapply the law. Alic was convicted of failing to prevent the deaths of four prisoners in his custody and <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2011/01/21/nb-05">participating in their inhumane treatment</a> [<em>SE Times</em> report].

The announcement comes one day after an Amnesty International researcher met with Haitian prosecutor Harycidas Auguste, giving him documents pertaining to dozens of cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions in Haiti between 1971 and 1986. The group also urged Haiti to allow for abuse victims to speak with the government to provide evidence. Al's researcher on Haiti, Gerardo Ducos praised the government's decision to investigate Duvalier and emphasized its importance to the country: <blockquote>Investigating Jean-Claude Duvalier for the human rights crimes committed during his time in power is a massive step forward. What we need to see now is a swift and impartial process, in line with international standards, that truly brings justice for those who have been waiting for too long...Torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions are crimes under international law...Justice must be done if Haiti is to move forward.</blockquote> AI is also calling on the UN to provide technical support for the investigation to ensure that it is properly administered.

<p>Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/22/newsid_2525000/2525501.stm">succeeded as leader</a> [BBC report] in 1971. Following a tumultuous reign, which included accusations of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2003/07/01/some-alleged-torturers-living-exile">thousands of murders by his regime</a> [HRW report], Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, and has since resided in France. In 2007, current Haitian leader Rene Preval expressed a renewed commitment to <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/haiti-president-vows-to-continue-legal.php">bring Duvalier to justice</a> [JURIST report], despite Duvalier's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/26/international.mainsection">pleas for forgiveness</a> [Guardian report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Portillo denies accusations that he diverted approximately USD $15 million in funds from the Ministry of Defense while he was in power between 2000 and 2004. Former Defense Minister Eduardo Arevalo and former Finance Minister Manuel Maza are also on trial. The trial was allowed to proceed after the <a target="_blank" href="http://cicig.org/index.php?page=inicio">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website, in Spanish] provided sufficient evidence to the court of Portillo's corruption. Evidence was also provided by the French government showing that bank accounts were established in the names of members of Portillo's family in order to launder the money. The trial was scheduled to begin in September, but was delayed after a series of objections by Portillo's lawyers. 

<p>In March, a Guatemalan court ruled that Portillo <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/guatemala-court-approves-extradition-of.php">can be extradited to the US</a> [JURIST report] to face charges of money laundering. He is accused of taking $15.8 million from funds designated for the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense and siphoning it into bank accounts in Europe and Bermuda. Portillo was <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8481914.stm">arrested</a> [BBC report] in January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/jmb-us-requests-extradition-of-former.php">following an arrest warrant issued by Guatemala</a> [JURIST report] based on the US indictment. In 2008, Portillo was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/mexico-extradites-former-guatemala.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] back to Guatemala from Mexico, where he had fled after his immunity expired along with his term in office. The extradition order was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/mexico-allows-extradition-of-ex.php">first signed</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, but Portillo challenged it until the Mexican Supreme Court ruled against him in January 2008. Lawyers for the Portillo and his minsters maintain their innocence, arguing that they were acting within the country's constitutional limits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenged rules are a part of the DOE's <a href="http://frwebgate2.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/PDFgate.cgi?WAISdocID=tUUYv4/0/2/0&WAISaction=retrieve">final regulations</a> [text, PDF] adopted in October. One rule challenged by the suit would stop deceptive advertising by schools. Another bars recruiters from being paid based on how many students they enroll. A third specifies minimum steps a state must take to authorize post-secondary programs that participate in federal student aid programs. In the complaint, filed at the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">District Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website], APSCU claims the DOE's final regulation's violate both the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ315.110.pdf">Higher Education Opportunity Act</a> [text, PDF] and the Constitution. Additionally, the complaint accuses the DOE of not granting private sector schools adequate representation during the negotiation rule-making process. APSCU claims that the DOE rushed the regulatory process for proposals that they knew would not be well-received in order to implement a desired outcome irrespective of the concerns of the stakeholders and the public. The DOE has not yet responded to the complaint.

<p>The new regulations are a part of a larger federal crackdown on for-profit schools that are accused of graduating poorly educated students with high student-loan debt. A <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10948t.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released by the US <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) [official website] accused for-profit colleges of promoting fraudulent practices so their students could acquire federal aid, exaggerating potential salary after graduation and failing to provide clear information about costs and duration of programs. Additionally, a 2009 GAO report found that for-profit college students were more likely to default on federal student loans than were students from other colleges. <br />

Highberger approved a settlement on Friday effectively limiting the use of seniority in layoffs in the <a href="http://notebook.lausd.net/portal/page?_pageid=33,47493&_dad=ptl&_schema=PTL_EP">Los Angeles Unified School District</a> (LAUSD) [official website]. The class action suit against the <a href="http://www.ca.gov/">State of California</a> [official website] and LAUSD was <a href="http://www.schoolfunding.info/news/litigation/LAUSDLayoffs.pdf">originally filed</a> [text, PDF] in February 2010 by the <a href="http://www.aclu-sc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California</a> (ACLU/SC) [official website] and attorneys at <a href="http://www.mofo.com/">Morrison &#38; Foerster, LLP</a> [official website] on behalf of California students. The class action suit accused the state of violating the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California Constitution</a> [text] by failing to provide equal opportunity in education and violating the privileges and immunities clause by adhering to a "last-hired, first-fired" layoff policy. The attorneys argued that policy was responsible for the firing of effective teachers which decimated the educational quality at the Plaintiff's schools. The parties reached a <a href="http://www.schoolfunding.info/ReedSettlementOutlineFINAL.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] in October which will prevent budget based layoffs in 45 schools whose educational quality would suffer from teacher turnovers and ensure that no school will experience greater turnover than the district average of layoffs that year. It also calls for the state to hire teachers that meet quality requirements and retention incentives to attract teachers and principals. <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/pages/?id=0019">Catherine Lhamon</a> [official website], director of impact litigation at <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/">Public Counsel Law Center</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.aclu-sc.org/releases/view/103060">praised the decision</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Judge Highberger literally changed the educational lives of tens of thousands of LA kids, promising them they won't have to carry the budgetary pain of the school district and instead can expect a chance to learn when they go to school.  As bleak as the State's financial crisis is, the good news today is that Judge Highberger restored the promise that all kids should be equal at school.</blockquote> The United Teachers of Los Angeles <a href="http://www.utla.net/system/files/ResponseACLUdecision_01212011.pdf">announced</a> [text, PDF] their plan to appeal the settlement, arguing that the settlement does not address the systemic problems at hard-to-staff schools.

<p>Challenges to teacher tenure rules have increased as States face budget problems. On Wednesday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie [official website] expressed his desire to <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=7907874">end teacher tenure based on seniority</a> [ABC report] as a part of his school reform plans. Instead, Christie proposes to base tenure on classroom performance. Critics, including the state teachers union, however, think Christie is moving too quickly with such reforms, and should instead be a gradual process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The poll results are not yet final, as election officials will reportedly quarantine some results after voter turnout in ten Sudanese counties exceeded 100 percent and thousands of votes <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-01/23/c_13703794.htm">have yet to be counted</a> [Xinhua report]. The final numbers will be announced between February 7 and 14, but the majority of experts believe that, even with the quarantined votes, the secession of Southern Sudan is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5invqx17YwhFFnF3WN0Fnvx-cC8WA?docId=795bbaf8781f4a9faece64da6051cfdd">inevitable</a> [AP report]. According to the 2005 <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8306.doc.htm">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) [UN report], the ten states of Southern Sudan may form a new nation if voter turnout for the referendum exceeds 60 percent and 50 percent of voters approve of independence. If the South does secede from the North, the world's 193rd country will be announced on July 9 in Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan. 

<p>In September 2010, a human rights expert told the UN that Sudan was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-expert-tells-un-sudan-unprepared-for-january-self-determination-referendum.php">not prepared</a> [JURIST report] for the referendum. Mohamed Chande Othman, a Tanzanian judge and independent expert on the Sudan human rights situation, presented a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.CRP.1_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in Geneva warning that Sudan did not have the necessary infrastructure in place and cited major setbacks, including the suppression of free speech and of the press, restrictions on other civil and political rights, and inadequate protection of society due to a lack of well-trained police officers, prosecutors and judges. The report also stated that there are unresolved issues, including border demarcation, residency and voter eligibility, as well as the lack of a referendum commission in the contentious region of Abyei in southern Sudan. Experts had feared that the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) [party website] of Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] would try to stop the election because, depending on where the border is drawn, it could result in as much as 80 percent of the nation's oil reserves landing in the new southern state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report also addressed the actions of Israeli forces during the raid which resulted in the deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists and concluded that they conformed with international law: <blockquote>After examining all the material it can be determined that the IDF soldiers acted professionally and in a measured manner in the face of extensive and unanticipated violence. This professionalism was evident, among other factors, in their continuing to switch back and forth between less-lethal and lethal weapons in order to address the nature of the violence directed at them.</blockquote> Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pMain.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6900616.stm">profile</a>] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ivzFF5EPN0G0sqLLmpEol57bLYgQ?docId=be53c7386bd4400290e91a2e47767a97">denounced the commission's findings</a> [AP report] hours after the report was released.

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-human-rights-council-adopts-report-on-israel-flotilla-raid.php">agreed to adopt</a> a recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-report-finds-israel-flotilla-raid-violated-international-law.php">report</a> [JURIST reports] criticizing Israel's raid of the Gaza-bound flotilla and finding the country committed various violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The UNHRC also adopted the conclusions relating to judicial remedies and reparations and called on the parties involved to abide by these recommendations, which include providing medical and psychological care to those who were tortured during the raid. In July 2010, an Israeli military probe into the flotilla incident found insufficient intelligence and planning, but <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">concluded that no punishments were necessary</a> [JURIST report]. Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/israel-complied-with-international-law-in-flotilla-raid-pm.php">testified before the civilian commission</a> [JURIST report] in August and expressed confidence that the commission would find Israeli actions to be in compliance with international law, explaining the Israeli response to the flotilla in the context of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The incident took place on May 31 when Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza. International law scholars have disagreed about the propriety of the IDF's raid, with some claiming that there were <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2010/10/israel-raid-on-gaza-flotilla-us-failure-to-condemn-despite-un-findings.php">clear violations of international law</a> while others found the raid <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2011/01/proportionality-and-the-flotilla-incident-in-light-of-international-law.php">necessary and proportionate</a> [JURIST op-eds]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Citing <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2011/01/201112463525794602.html">lack of evidence</a> [Al Jazeera report], a military judge convicted the men of the lesser crime of insubordination instead of torture. He <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/Indonesian-Soldiers-Charged-With-Torture-Sentenced-to-Prison-114476609.html">sentenced</a> [VOA report] one of the men to 10 months imprisonment, one to nine months and the third to eight months. The men were caught on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2010/10/20/sidner.indo.papua.torture.cnn.html">video</a> [CNN report; WARNING: readers may find the video disturbing] carrying out the torture last October. They were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/indonesia-president-soldiers-to-face-trial-over-torture-video.php">tried by a military tribunal</a> after Indonesian officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/indonesia-admits-responsibility-for-detainee-torture-video.php">admitted</a> [JURIST reports] to their soldiers' involvement in the torture. International human rights groups have reacted negatively to the prison sentences, saying they are <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/indonesian-soldiers&#8217;-sentence-papua-abuse-video-too-light-2011-01-24">too lenient</a> [press release]. Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Deputy Program Director Donna Guest said:<blockquote>It is incredible that senior Indonesian government officials have called this abuse - which included one of the men having his genitals burned - a 'minor violation.' While we welcome government efforts to provide justice for the two Papuan men, the fact that the victims were too frightened to testify in person due to the lack of adequate safety guarantees, raises serious questions about the trial process.</blockquote>The group called for human rights violations to be prosecuted in civilian, rather than military, courts.

<p>Indonesia has recently faced criticism over a variety of recent human rights issues. In December, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the Indonesian government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/rights-group-urges-indonesia-to-repeal-laws-violating-human-rights.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] two <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/94454/section/11">Sharia laws</a> [report materials; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/29/indonesia-local-sharia-laws-violate-rights-aceh">press release</a>] that the group says violate human rights and international treaties. The laws, local to the Aceh province, require strict Islamic dress in public and prohibit unmarried men and women from being alone together. In June, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/23/prosecuting-political-aspiration-0">released a report</a> [report materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-indonesia-to-respect-free-expression.php">report</a>] criticizing the Indonesian government for its treatment of <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16274331">Papuan</a> [Economist backgrounder] and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/south-moluccas.htm">Moluccan</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] secessionists who, according to the report, face imprisonment, torture and denial of medical treatment for their beliefs. In April, the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/indonesia-constitutional-court-upholds.php">voted 8-1 to uphold</a> [JURIST report] a controversial anti-blasphemy law enacted in 1965 by the first Indonesian president. In 2008, HRW called for Indonesia to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/indonesia-bound-to-protect-islamic-sect.php">protect freedom of religion</a> [JURIST report] and reverse a decree that provides for the prosecution of members of a controversial Islamic sect and to uphold its commitments under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

McCoy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-mulls-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>] that Chase was not required to provide a cardholder with a change-in-terms notice before raising the interest rate on his credit card. The case required the court to determine whether an interest rate increase constituted a "change in terms" under <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-1400.html">Regulation Z, 12 CFR &#167; 226.9(c)</a> [text], which requires that a creditor provide a cardholder with a change-in-terms notice when the contractual terms governing the account have changed. The parties disputed the proper interpretation of the regulation with cardholder James McCoy arguing that the plain text indicates a change in the periodic interest rate resulting from a cardholder's default is a "change in terms" requiring notice. The court, however, adopted the interpretation advocated by Chase. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, stated:<blockquote>We recognize that McCoy's argument has some force; read in isolation, the language quoted above certainly suggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an interest-rate increase imposed pursuant to cardholder delinquency or default. But McCoy's analysis begs the key question: whether the increase actually changed a "term" of the Agreement that was "required to be disclosed under &#167; 226.6." If not, &#167; 226.9(c)'s subsequent notice requirement with respect to a "change in terms" does not apply. Chase argues precisely this: The increase did not change a term in the Agreement, but merely implemented one that had been initially disclosed, as required. This interpretation, though not commanded by the text of the regulation, is reasonable.</blockquote>Sotomayor went on to provide further justification for the court's interpretation of Regulation Z by stating that, when a regulation is ambiguous with regards to a question presented to the court, it is required to look to the issuing body's interpretation for guidance. In this case, the court deferred to the interpretation of the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve Board</a> [official website], which it found to be in line with the regulatory text. 

<p>The interpretation of the Supreme Court is in contrast to that of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/03/16/0656278.pdf">previously found</a> [opinion, PDF] that Regulation Z does require the creditor to provide the cardholder with a change-in-terms notice where the cardholder has defaulted, triggering an increase in the interest rate. However, it is in line with that of the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website], which originally dismissed McCoy's complaint on the grounds that the increased interest rate was not a "change in terms" and did not require Chase to provide prior notice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hangings are reported as the first executions involving activists that were arrested and detained after the disputed elections. The two men, Jafar Kazemi and Mohammadali Hajaghaie, members of exiled opposition group, Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO), were convicted for their involvement in <a href="http://www.irna.com/NewsShow.aspx?NID=30203103">creating and distributing photos and films</a> [IRNA report, in Persian] of the revolution and street protests. The hangings follow a <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/August/20100811095859su0.9788172.html">plea</a> [press release] by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in August to stop the executions and to respect fundamental freedoms, especially the rights of expression. Iranian authorities claim that their decision to execute Kazemi and Hajaghaje was not grounded on fundamental rights but on the dangers that the members of MKO posed to the government.The MKO is allegedly responsible for activities involving former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and numerous terrorist attacks and assassinations of significant figures and civilians.

<p>The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Aside from the repeated pleas form the US, Amnesty International labeled human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">among the worst of the past 20 years</a> [JURIST report]. Human rights groups have also called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">appoint a special envoy</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of rights violations. Alleged human rights abuses of detainees include <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-judicial-panel-rejects-rape.php">sexual assault</a>,<a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-election-protester-death-deemed.php"> beatings</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/iran-forcing-confessions-from-political.php">forced confessions</a> [JURIST reports].

The case involves a Michigan man, Randall Fields, who was questioned by investigators about a child sex-abuse case while he was in the county jail serving a 45-day sentence for disorderly conduct. A lower court found that Fields did not have to be given his Miranda rights because the investigators were questioning him about a separate crime.

United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FINAL-CERT-PET.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine a circuit split over the retroactive application of the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> (SORNA) [final guidelines, PDF], which requires sex offenders to register. The attorney general determined in 2007 that all states would have to follow the federal rule to keep registration current. Billy Joe Reynolds pleaded guilty for failure to register his new address but attempted to challenge the application of SORNA against him because his sex offender conviction in 2001 predated the attorney general's rule change. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084747np.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that this did not give him "standing" to challenge the rule's application.  </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-333.pdf">Swarthout v. Cooke</a> [opinion, PDF], the court, in a <em>per curiam</em> opinion, summarily reversed a decision of the Ninth Circuit to grant prisoners' release who were denied parole. In reversing the decision, the court held that prisoners have no right to parole and that states are under no duty to offer parole. Both prisoners had attempted to seek <em>habeas</em> relief in California state courts but were denied. Prisoner Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree murder in 1978 and was found suitable for parole in 2003 by the parole board, but the governor stepped in under his discretion and found him unsuitable for parole. Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg wrote a short concurring opinion saying that the court does have the right to review the constitutionality of the application of parole procedures. The court has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sc-dc-0125-supreme-court-20110124,0,4251652.story">overturned</a> [LAT report] three Ninth Circuit opinions in the past week, all written by liberal judge Stephen Reinhardt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report accuses countries of adopting soft approaches to human rights, such as dialogue and cooperation, without adopting concrete policies or pressuring violators to change. The report cited the increasing "use of dialogue and cooperation in lieu of public pressure" by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> and members of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a>, <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.aspx?id=1847&lang=en">EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a> [official websites] Catherine Ashton's preference for diplomacy, and US President Barack Obama's <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">inconsistent use of concrete actions</a> [JURIST report] against human rights violations. According to the report:<blockquote>This is a particularly inopportune time for proponents of human rights to lose their public voice, because various governments that want to prevent the vigorous enforcement of human rights have had no qualms about raising theirs. ... Dialogues would have a far greater impact if they were tied to concrete and publicly articulated benchmarks. ... UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been notably reluctant to put pressure on abusive governments. ... Whatever the rationalization, the quest for dialogue and cooperation is simply not a universal substitute for public pressure as a tool to promote human rights. Defending human rights is rarely convenient. It may sometimes interfere with other governmental interests. But if governments want to pursue those interest instead of human rights, they should at least have the courage to admit it, instead of hiding behind meaningless dialogues and fruitless quests for cooperation.</blockquote>HRW highlighted recent examples of soft approaches to human rights violations including the response of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/asean-leaders-establish-human-rights.php">ASEAN</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-reports-human-rights-abuses-and-calls-for-investigation-in-myanmar.php">Burmese repression</a>, the UN's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/UN-SG-urges-sri-lanka-to-normalize-conditions-around-un-offices.php">deference toward atrocities in Sri Lanka</a>, the EU's approach to <a href="/hotline/2009/10/eus-lifting-of-sanctions-against.php">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-turkmenistan-to-emphasize.php">Turkmenistan</a> [JURIST reports], the reaction by the West to repressive African leaders in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, India's policies towards <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and the world community's non-confrontation to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china">China</a> [JURIST news archives].

According to the report, the democratic world showed little resistance to the continuing repressive authoritarian regimes of the world, including China, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=venezuela">Venezuela</a> [JURIST news archives]. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guinea+bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti">Haiti</a> [JURIST news archives], and Sri Lanka were removed from the list of electoral democracies.

North American Stainless</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-considers-securities-fraud-employment-discrimination-cases.php">report</a>] that a third party can sue his employer for retaliation. Eric Thompson was fired from <a href="http://www.northamericanstainless.com/">North American Stainless</a> (NAS) [official website] after the company learned that his fiancee, Miriam Regalado, had filed an action under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [materials] alleging sex discrimination. The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-soft-money-ban.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to determine if Thompson could file a claim under the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII even though he was not the individual directly aggrieved by the sex discrimination and, if so, if he had standing to file a claim. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit both determined that the statute "does not permit third party retaliation claims." The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, reversed and remanded stating that the language of the Title VII anti-retaliation provision, which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against "any of his employees" for engaging in protected conduct, was broad enough to include the firing of Thompson. The court further determined that Thompson had standing to sue under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] because he was directly aggrieved by the employer's action:<blockquote>[A]ccepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation - collateral damage, so to speak, of the employer's unlawful act.  To the contrary, injuring him was the employer's intended means of harming Regalado.  Hurting him was the unlawful act by which the employer punished her. In those circumstances, we think Thompson well within the zone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justice Stephen Breyer in which she pointed out that this view of the anti-retaliation provision was previously endorsed by the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Opportunity Employment Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] in its <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/compliance.cfm">Compliance Manual</a> [materials]. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision.

<p>The Supreme Court currently has other Title VII cases on its docket. Last month, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-to-hear-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-global-warming-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, a massive gender discrimination class action lawsuit. The court will determine whether claims for monetary relief can be certified under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)</a> [text] and whether the class certification ordered under this rule was consistent with FRCP 23(a). The case concerns an action filed in 2001 by female Wal-Mart employees alleging that the company's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST report] in April.  he class is estimated to include more than 1.5 million women employed by Wal-Mart since December 26, 1998, which makes it the largest class action lawsuit in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-summary-judgment-appeal.php">report</a>] that a party may not appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits. Petitioner Michelle Ortiz was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer in prison and then placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for reporting the assault. She brought a &#167; 1983 claim against respondents Paula Jordan, a case manager at the prison, and Rebecca Bright, who was responsible for Ortiz's time in solitary confinement. The district court denied respondents' motion for summary judgment, and they went ahead with trial without appealing. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Ortiz more than $600,000. Jordan and Bright subsequently appealed the denial of summary judgment. Rejecting their claim, Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg wrote:<blockquote>In the case before us, the Court of Appeals, although purporting to review the District Court's denial of the prison officials' pretrial summary-judgment motion, several times pointed to evidence presented only at the trial stage of the proceedings. The appeals court erred, but not fatally, by incorrectly placing its ruling under a summary judgment headline. Its judgment was infirm, however, because Jordan's and Bright's failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule50.htm">50(b)</a> [Cornell, text] left the appellate forum with no warrant to reject the appraisal of the evidence by the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and had the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.</blockquote> While the vote was unanimous, Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurrence, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. The concurrence maintains that the court granted <em>certiorari</em> to decide only the issue of whether a party may appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits, and argues that the court reached too far in addressing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), suggesting that they should rule on the narrow question and remand for consideration any further issues.

<p>The Court's decision reverses and remands the earlier <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0196n-06.pdf&pli=1">ruling</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">Sixth Circuit</a> [official website], which held in March 2009 that, "although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits, denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule." There was previously a circuit split on this issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court disagreed, holding that tribunal was legal and constitutional. The ruling also <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1124527.ece">focused on the question</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] of whether the court-martial could be considered "any court" under the <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Introduction.htm">Sri Lankan Constitution</a> [text] for purposes of disqualifying a person from serving in government. The court ruled that it does, preventing Fonseka from returning to his seat in parliament. The conviction also means that he will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12276057">lose civic rights</a> [BBC report], including the right to vote for six years, and carries a 30-month jail sentence.

<p>Last September, Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mahinda+Rajapaksa">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/sri-lanka-president-ratifies-ex-army-chiefs-prison-sentence.php">ratified the 30-month prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for Fonseka after a court convicted him of corruption. The court found that Fonseka gave preference to an arms company operated by his son-in-law. Fonseka, who is credited with bringing an end to the 26-year civil war, was arrested shortly after his defeat in the January 2009 presidential election in which he ran against Rajapaksa. He has been held in military custody since the arrest. Fonseka's lawyers accused the court of irregularities, and Fonseka has accused the government of seeking revenge for his decision to run in the presidential elections. Fonseka was dishonorably discharged and stripped of his rank, medals and pension.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his report, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110125/ts_afp/somaliapiracyun_20110125051009">set to undergo debate</a> [AFP report] in the UN Security Council Tuesday, Lang encouraged members to take steps and allocate resources to reduce piracy levels through the implementation of tougher security measures, as well as the establishment of an international tribunal. The report cited the increase in Somali pirate attacks and the associated costs, estimated at more than $7 billion a year, as the strongest justifications for a new approach to the problem. While warships from numerous countries already patrol shipping lanes near Somalia, Lang called for closer patrol covering areas known to be hideouts as a part of his plan to increase security against attacks. Lang also suggested the creation of a court which would be located in a foreign country but remain under Somali jurisdiction to assist in prosecuting cases of alleged piracy, a responsibility which has <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-urges-nations-to-assist-kenya-in-conducting-piracy-trials.php">overwhelmed certain countries</a> [JURIST report] in the past. However, in a move being applauded and viewed as a step forward in deterring piracy, both Malaysia and South Korea <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gDliAD2agDucG-SBaokzizZ2mdLw?docId=5688d64a0bd242ec836634d9b19630e0">plan to prosecute</a> [AP report] 12 Somali pirates captured in two separate raids last Friday. 

<p>Other nations have also provided deterrents to Somali piracy through capture and prosecution. In November, the <a href="http://justiz.hamburg.de/oberlandesgericht/">Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">commenced</a> [JURIST report] Germany's first piracy trial in 400 years against 10 accused Somali pirates. The suspects were charged with hijacking a ship registered in Hamburg off the Horn of Africa and face maximum sentences of between 10 and 15 years in prison. The accused were arrested by the Dutch navy hours after they took over the "Taipan" on April 5. Also in November, the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] began the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-court-begins-trial-of-accused-somali-pirates.php">first US piracy trial</a> [JURIST report] in more than 100 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

House Bill 74, Validity of Marriage, was passed by a 32-27 House vote and will now be turned over to the Senate. The Wyoming House of Representatives has <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_4876d7cc-27f2-11e0-bc10-001cc4c002e0.html">rejected similar legislation</a> [<em>Star-Tribune</em> report] twice in recent years.

HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-eu-failing-to-stand-up-to-rights-abuses-hrw.php">released</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/wr2011.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF] Monday, which claimed that EU member states and the UN have <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/24/world-report-governments-soft-talking-abusers">failed to adequately respond</a> [press release] to human rights abuses and violations. The report criticized Ban for not putting pressure on countries with poor human rights records. Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5051">affirmed</a> [press release] his commitment to human rights Tuesday when addressing the Human Rights Council:<blockquote>The General Assembly established this Council nearly five years ago to put human rights on a par with development and peace. Some worried this Council would become biased, others saw it as a great hope for solving every human rights challenge that confronts our world. Two years ago, I came here and issued a challenge. I called on the Council to promote human rights without favour, without selectivity, without any undue influence.</blockquote>Ban's remarks to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, were made in anticipation of the Council's upcoming five-year review.

<p>The HRW report criticized the UN, the Human Rights Council and Ban for failing to adequately enforce human rights. The report specifically mentioned Ban's reluctance to put pressure on abusive governments, and substituting dialogue and cooperation for public pressure to promote human rights. HRW's report highlighted the UN's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/UN-SG-urges-sri-lanka-to-normalize-conditions-around-un-offices.php">deference toward atrocities in Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST report] as an example of the UN's human rights shortcomings. Sri Lanka faced numerous allegations of human rights violations originating from incidents that took place during the final months of its 30-year civil war. In May, HRW announced it had acquired <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-claims-to-have-new-evidence-of-sri-lanka-wartime-abuses.php">new evidence</a> [JURIST report] supporting allegations of war crimes. Although Ban affirmed his commitment to set up a UN panel investigating the human rights violations in Sri Lanka, HRW was dissatisfied with the UN's response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Berenson and her lawyer, the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gcPDUeKCJY2HDAZRnf6qx38R8uEg?docId=ba395c73ab2b4374b7fb6da8f83d7ce5">ruling was final and cannot be appealed</a> [AP report], representing a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-24/peruvian-court-upholds-decision-to-grant-lori-berenson-parole.html">major setback</a> [<em>Bloomberg</em> report] to the government's efforts to return her to jail.

If her sentence is commuted, Berenson would be deported immediately, allowing her to return to her native New York.

<p>In November, a Peruvian judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/peru-judge-reinstates-parole-for-us-woman-held-for-involvement-with-rebel-group.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] Berenson's parole, prompting another appeal from the government.

Judges for the court restored her sentence in August, however, after legal authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/peru-judge-revokes-parole-of-us-woman-held-for-involvement-with-rebel-group.php">failed to verify addresses of residence</a> [JURIST report] provided by Berenson after her release.

Ghailani could have received a minimum of 20 years in prison, but instead received the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/nyregion/26ghailani.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">maximum sentence</a> [NYT report] of life imprisonment without parole. The sentencing occurred a few days after the court <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/012111ghailani.pdf">denied a request</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-denies-request-to-overturn-ex-guantanamo-detainees-conviction.php">report</a>] to throw out the conviction. Judge Lewis Kaplan said in his ruling that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to allow the jury to find Ghailani a "knowing and willing participant" in the attacks. The defense had argued that the conviction was inconsistent with the fact that that the jury exonerated the defendant on 284 other counts but convicted him on one charge of conspiracy.

<p>Ghailani's conviction in November has been praised as a "victory" for the American justice system because Ghailani <a href="/forum/2010/11/ghailani-verdict-a-victory-for-american-justice.php">appeared before a jury</a> instead of a military commission and the government was able to win its case <a href="/forum/2010/11/the-ghailani-trial-justice-served.php">without using evidence obtained through torture</a> [JURIST commentaries]. In October, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-court-hears-opening-statements-in-ex-guantanamo-detainees-civilian-trial.php">heard arguments in the trial</a> [JURIST report], the first civilian trial of a former Guantanamo detainee. An attorney for Ghailani argued during the opening statements that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] took advantage of Ghailani's youth and that Ghailani was unaware of the terrorists' criminal plans. In July, Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-charges-against-ex-guantanamo-detainee.php">refused to dismiss charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ghailani, ruling that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had not been violated. Ghailani's lawyers had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-seek.php">sought a dismissal of charges</a>, arguing that he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-argue.php">denied the right to a speedy trial</a> [JURIST reports] while being detained for nearly five years in CIA secret prisons and later at Guantanamo Bay. Earlier in July, Kaplan ruled that Ghailani was not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and was therefore <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-rules-former-guantanamo-detainee-fit-to-stand-trial.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href = "http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/ERES1782.htm">report</a> [text], compiled by <a href = "http://www.dickmarty.ch/pages/home/news.aspx">Dick Marty</a> [personal website, in Italian] of the <a href = "http://www.alde.eu/">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe</a> [official website], PACE declared:<blockquote>The Assembly strongly reaffirms the need for an absolutely uncompromising fight against impunity for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations, and wishes to point out that the fact that these were committed in the context of a violent conflict could never justify a decision to refrain from prosecuting anyone who has committed such acts. There cannot and must not be one justice for the winners and another for the losers. Whenever a conflict has occurred, all criminals must be prosecuted and held responsible for their illegal acts, whichever side they belonged to and irrespective of their political role.</blockquote>PACE called for EU member states and the <a href = "http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> to contribute to and support the <a href = "http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX), as well as provide all pertinent information requested. The report was approved unanimously following a <a href = "http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12462.htm">debate</a> [transcript] and was the culmination of an investigation <A href = "/paperchase/2008/06/council-of-europe-to-investigate-kosovo.php">announced two years ago</a> [JURIST report]. At that time, Albania <a href = "/paperchase/2008/10/albania-prosecutor-refuses-to.php">refused to investigate</a> [JURIST report] the allegations. In the debate, Marty also contended that Kosovo's <a href = "http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [official website, in Albanian] headed a splinter group of the KLA and that he "exerted violent control over the trade in heroin and other narcotics" and "ordered&#8212;and in some cases personally over[saw]&#8212;assassinations, detentions, beatings and interrogations in various parts of Kosovo." Albania and Kosovo now <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBYT23740820110113">welcome an international probe</a> [Reuters report] but have <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iFOw5gmk0r6z1GtTWtRKbSagxzzw?docId=CNG.66611c06a3acd7de23902bf90fe8c74c.331">denied</a> [AFP report] Thaci's involvement. Thaci has also systematically <a href = "http://www.kryeministri-ks.com/?page=1,9,1807">denied the allegations</a> [statement, in Albanian].

<p>Former prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile] <a href = "/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged in a book</a> [JURIST report] that approximately 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of organ trafficking during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo, but that a 2003 probe by her ICTY team failed to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute. In response, parliamentarians submitted a <a href = "http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?Link=/documents/workingdocs/doc08/edoc11574.htm">motion</a> [text] in 2008 requesting that the Assembly investigate the organ trafficking charges. Del Ponte said reliable sources told her that members of the KLA  took the organs of young, healthy prisoners for <a href = "http://www.kosovocompromise.com/cms/item/topic/en.html?view=story&id=725&sectionId=2">black-market sales</a> [<em>Kosovo Compromise</em> report]. The Swiss Foreign Ministry later barred Del Ponte from promoting the book because it was inconsistent with her role as the Swiss ambassador. In March of 2008, the <a href = "http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">office of the Serbian war crimes prosecutor</a> [official website] said that it was <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/serbia-war-crimes-prosecutor-serbia-war.php">investigating "informal statements"</a> [JURIST report] received from ICTY investigators alleging illegal organ harvesting. The next month, Serbia <a href = "/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-asking-icty-to-reopen-probe-into.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to officially request that the ICTY resume a probe into the organ trafficking allegations, even though Kosovo Justice Minister Nekibe Kelmendi dismissed the allegations as "fabrications." The same month, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2008/05/hrw-urges-probe-of-kosovo-organ.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] leaders of Kosovo and Albania to launch an investigation into the allegations, but, as of May, had not received a response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the new treaty, each country will be allowed to have 1,550 warheads as opposed to the 2,200 allowed under the old <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [materials] that expired in December 2009.

First, the ratification of the treaty will have a positive impact in all areas of bilateral cooperation&#8212;the signing of START-3 completely draws a line under the Cold War. Secondly, the New START treaty fully meets the interests of Russia, who chose a less costly and more rational approach." Russia included non-binding language in its ratification <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqrvgDunXCeR4d4lc5L_gCCTY-rQ?docId=ea961514fe5447ab9a0ad5b1ed8f1988">disapproving US plans</a> [AP report] to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said that the treaty will <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110126/162310669.html">not affect Russian plans</a> [RIA Novosti report] to build a missile defense system. Russia's lower house <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110125/162297826.html">ratified the treaty</a> [RIA Novosti report] Tuesday.

<p>Russia's lower house originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-lower-house-quickly-approves-new-start-treaty.php">approved the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in December. Earlier that month, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-ratifies-russia-nuclear-arms-treaty.php">voted 71-26</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the treaty. US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague in April. The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] last February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ben Ali, his wife and other family members face allegations that they <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-LwuYrv8kNfnY_cE6P_9SnMC9Qg?docId=CNG.189a3a1fe5c8bba71806f5a7de2822bc.671">illegally transferred money</a> [AFP report] out of the country, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/26/tunisia.warrant/">possessed unlicensed weapons</a> [CNN report] and incited armed violence. Chebbi said some of the former president's family members have already been arrested, though others have <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2011/01/23/tunisia-ben-ali.html">traveled to Canada</a> [CBC report] where some of them have permanent resident status.

Control orders, created by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/2/contents">Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2005</a> (PTA) [text], impose a variety of legal restrictions on individuals suspected of terrorism-related activity, regardless of the suspect's citizenship status or whether he or she has been convicted of any wrongdoing.  May <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/parliamentary-business/oral-statements/ct-review/">described</a> [text] the existing policy as "draconian," saying:<blockquote>We are also clear that the current control order regime is imperfect and has not been as effective as it should be.  We therefore propose to repeal control orders.  Instead, we will introduce a new package of measures which is better focused and has more targeted restrictions, supported by significantly increased resources for surveillance and other investigative tools.  Restrictions that have an impact on an individual's ability to lead a normal life should be the minimum necessary, should be proportionate and should be clearly justified.  The legislation we will bring forward will make clearer what restrictions can and cannot be imposed.</blockquote>Under the revised system, suspects may be detained without charges for a maximum of 14 days as opposed to the current 28, though the government may seek an extension under emergency circumstances; new restrictions governing law enforcement's use of its stop and search authority will be imposed; and the use of police surveillance will be limited to investigating offenses carrying a minimum six month prison sentence.  Additionally, those subject to the revamped control orders would be afforded greater freedoms than under the current system, though specifics are not yet available.  The forthcoming legislation, if approved by Parliament, will be permanent unlike the PTA which requires annual renewal.

<p>In their current form, restrictions can include curfews, limits on internet access, restrictions on travel, and limitations on employment, school, access to bank accounts and contact with other people.  <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR45/012/2010/en/bbaadcd1-28fe-491f-9e4a-1550e63fbed9/eur450122010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/uk-control-orders-violate-suspects-rights-ai.php">report</a>] in August calling for an end to the use of control orders against terrorism suspects, characterizing the orders as legal sanctions without trial.  A month prior, the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/civilappeals.htm">UK Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/869.html">ruled</a> [judgment, text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-appeals-court-rules-terror-suspects-may-sue-over-wrongful-control-orders.php">report</a>] that two terrorism suspects could sue the government for damages over wrongfully imposed control orders. In June The UK Supreme Court in <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-supreme-court-rules-curfew-restrictions-violated-appellants-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a control order requiring an anonymous appellant to live 150 miles from his family and operate under a 16-hour curfew violated his rights under the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text].  In September 2009, then-Home Secretary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2091320.stm">Alan Johnson</a> [BBC profile] said the government would <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-government-to-review-control-order.php">undertake a review</a> [JURIST report] of the system.  The UK Law Lords ruled in October 2007 that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-top-court-limits-control-orders.php">government may continue to impose control orders</a> [JURIST report] on terror suspects in lieu of detention, but said that some elements of the orders violate human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hoi was convicted of violating Vietnam's national security for information contained in articles he posted on the internet. According to Hoi's defense lawyer, he was convicted of <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/2011/01/vietnamese-dissident-sentenced-8-years-jail">spreading anti-government propaganda</a> [AP report] on the internet. Hoi joined the communist party in 1980 and became a high-ranking party leader. He began advocating democratic reform in 2006 and was subsequently expelled from the communist party. In accordance with the court's ruling, Hoi now faces eight year in jail with an additional five years under house arrest following his jail term. 

<p>Hoi is among several dissidents in Vietnam who have been convicted for anti-government activity. In January 2010 a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five and a half years in prison for subversion. <br />

Judge Silver's order suspends the time limits set forth in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00003161----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 3161</a> [text], which require that a federal criminal trial commence 70 days after a complaint or indictment. The judicial emergency allows a federal criminal trial to begin a maximum of 180 days after being charged. The emergency order does not affect the provision requiring filing of an indictment within 30 days of an arrest and it does not affect time limits for those that are awaiting trial. Chief Judge <a href="http://www.ce9.uscourts.gov/chief_judge_bio.html">Alex Kozinski</a> [official profile], the chair of the <a href="http://www.ce9.uscourts.gov/judicial_council.html">Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], expressed hope that Congress would aid the Arizona district courts stating: <blockquote>The district court in Arizona urgently needs additional resources. Judicial vacancies need to be filled and new judgeships should be given strong consideration. There is also
a need for more court staff and facilities.</blockquote>

<p>The order declared the federal emergency would last for 30 days, but at the request of Judge Silver the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council extended the suspension for an additional year. The suspension will last until February 19, 2012.</p>

<p>The judicial emergency was one of the initiatives of Chief Judge <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2011/01/09/victim-profile-john-roll-63-arizona-federal-judge/">John Roll</a> [WSJ Profile], who was among the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-federal-judge-killed-in-shooting-congresswoman-in-critical-condition.php">victims of the recent shooting</a> [JURIST report] in Tucson, Arizona. Arizona federal courts have experienced a drastic increase in their federal criminal caseload due to illegal <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] and drug trafficking. The Arizona federal court currently has three vacancies and is eligible for as many as five judgeships based on its case load. In the Tucson division, which handles the most cases, three judges are handling an average of 1,200 cases each. While the strain on the District Court in Arizona is front and center due to recent events, nationwide there has been a shortage of judges, and various legal groups have called on the President and Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/legal-reform-groups-urge-us-government-to-make-judicial-nominations-top-priority.php">make nominations and confirmations a top priority</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs invested hundreds of millions of dollars with the <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website] subsidiary between 2005 and 2007, believing the purchases of mortgage-backed securities to be "conservative, low-risk investments."  The suit claims that Countrywide "recklessly" misrepresented the stability of the investments and failed to adhere to its stated underwriting and credit analysis procedures, leading the credit ratings of many of the securities to fall significantly.  The complaint also names several former Countrywide executives as defendants, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

<p>BOA has recently been the target of several lawsuits alleging fraud.

Roger Linquist, MetroPCS's president and CEO, said in a statement that his company's <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/01/metro_pcs_sues_fcc_to_overturn.html">reasons to sue were similar</a> [WP report] to Verizon's, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">filed a similar suit last week</a> [JURIST report]. Verizon is challenging the regulations, which would prevent Internet providers from selectively blocking web access, saying they "go beyond any authority provided by Congress." The new net neutrality rules were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-approves-net-neutrality-rules.php">approved last month</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website], and the controversy surrounding the regulations suggested <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703581204576033513990668654.html">legal challenges would be pursued</a> [WSJ report].

<p>The FCC has long been trying to exert more control over Internet regulation. Last year, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] introduced <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/demint.net.neutrality.bill.072110.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] found that the FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit revolves around a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">2007 shooting incident</a> [JURIST news report] in the Nisour Square area of Baghdad that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead. A subsequent <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] investigation revealed that 14 of the deaths were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/middleeast/14blackwater.html?_r=1">unjustified acts of excessive force</a> [NYT report]. The lawsuit, the last remaining in relation to the shooting incident, was filed by the families of six victims. In his ruling, Judge Terrence Boyle said that nonresidents lack the right to sue in federal court for injuries sustained outside of the country, but that federal courts are obligated to remand such cases to the state level, where North Carolina law permits such suits.

<p>Foreign governments as well as US courts and agencies continue to scrutinize the role of private security contractors in conflicts abroad as incidents of violence and abuse have raised concerns that the firms operate largely outside of the law. In October, the Afghan government announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-government-disslves-eight-private-security-firms.php">disbanded eight private security companies</a> [JURIST report] operating locally and confiscated their weapons pursuant to a decree from <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/index_eng.aspx">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile]. In September, a judge in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-declares-mistrial-in-murder-case-against-blackwater-contractors.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] in a murder case against two Blackwater defense contractors after the jury failed to reach a verdict following nine hours of deliberation. The defendants were charged with killing two unnamed men in Kabul and argued self-defense. In February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Blackwater following allegations that the company bribed Iraqi officials with $1 million to allow them to continue operating in the country after the Nisour Square incident. Bribery of foreign officials is a violation of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/statute.html">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> (FCPA) [text, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000078--dd001-.html">15 USC &#167; 78dd-1</a> text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Protests were held Thursday in Egypt's capital Cairo, as well as the city of Suez, and are reportedly <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/protests_in_egypt_enter_third_day/2288720.html">spreading across the country</a> [RFE/RL report]. In Suez, police resorted the use of rubber-coated bullets, water cannons and teargas, after protesters <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/201112734210243448.html">burnt down a police post</a> [Al Jazeera report]. On Tuesday, Egypt's Ministry of Interior announced it would <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12283849">no longer tolerate the protests</a> [BBC report], which have resulted in several deaths. Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Egyptian opposition leader <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-bio.html#">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> [Nobel profile] has expressed his willingness to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12300164">lead a transitional government</a> [BBC report]. Elbaradei, who previously led the UN's <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [offical website], said he was planning to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-27/egyptian-opposition-leader-elbaradei-returns-to-cairo-following-protests.html">return to Egypt</a> [Bloomberg report] on Thursday to join the protests. 

<p>According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is modeled after recent civil unrest in Tunisia that culminated with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali this month. The Tunisian Constitutional Council, the country's highest legal authority on constitutional issues, declared that the leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, will <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/January/middleeast_January262.xml&section=middleeast">assume power</a> [AFP report] until elections are held in two months.

The new law, which amends the 2009 penal code amendment bill, has already drawn heavy criticism from regional media watchdogs, such as the <a href="http://www.mediacouncilmw.org/">Media Council of Malawi</a> (MCM) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.misa.org/chapters/malawi/misamalawi.html">National Media Institute of Southern Africa in Malawi</a> (NAMISA) [official website], which charged that the bill gives political allies of the president unchecked authority to exercise arbitrary regulatory power of the African nation's media.  NAMISA has also argued that the law is unconstitutional under <a href="http://www.sdnp.org.mw/constitut/chapter4.html#36">Section 36 of the Malawi Constitution</a> [text], which stipulates that "the press shall have the right to report and publish freely, within Malawi and abroad, and to be accorded the fullest possible facilities for access to public information."  Free press advocates have asked  Mutharika to agree not to use the new authority in an abusive fashion and urged the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.mw">Malawian Parliament</a> [official website] to refrain from advancing bills that would run counter to the principles of a free democracy.</p>

<p>Mutharika has had a rocky relationship with the press during his time in office.  In November 2010, the Malawian government <a href="http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/malawi-government-threatens-advertisement-ban-on-daily-times.html">threatened</a> [<em>Nyasa Times</em> report] the publishers of the Malawi <a href="http://www.bnltimes.com/"><em>Daily Times</em></a> [official website], Blantyre Newspapers Limited (BNL), with a ban on advertising sales after one of their five publications ran stories covering sex scandals involving national celebrities and socialites.  The government had already banned the publication of BNL's <em>Weekend Times</em>, which ran several such stories, for the paper's failure to register with the nation's national archives, a violation that critics charged was a pretext. In August 2010, his administration <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE67P0KN20100826">threatened</a> [Reuters  report] to shut down news outlets and refuse aid and donations from foreign organizations and governments after several papers reported on a British study that suggested more than a million people in Malawi were in need of food aid.  In July 2009, to the alarm of free pres advocates, Malawi police in the capital of Lilongwe <a href="http://www.ifex.org/malawi/2009/07/13/kamlomo_questioned/">arrested</a> [IFEX report] the editor of privately-owned Zodiak Broadcasting, Gabriel Kamlomo, on charges of causing public panic by broadcasting what police said was untrue information about a murder case.  Station representatives told NAMISA that police accused Kamlomo of criticizing police for the lack of an investigation.  Kamlomo was <a href="http://www.ifex.org/malawi/2010/12/07/kamlomo_freed/">acquitted</a> [IFEX report] in December 2010.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge David Hittner of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website], who <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-orders-stanford-trial-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, ordered Stanford to enter detoxification for an addiction to anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications prescribed to him by prison physicians that has rendered him unable to meaningfully contribute to his defense. Hittner also <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/stanford/7399162.html">denied a request</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report] made by Stanford's attorneys to allow him to seek treatment at a private clinic, recommending instead that he be transferred to a federal <a href="http://www.bop.gov/">Bureau of Prisons</a> (BOP) [official website] medical facility. A new trial date has yet to be scheduled, though Hittner advised lawyers for both sides to prepare themselves to proceed.

<p>Stanford is accused of <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/stanford/StanfordIndict.pdf">defrauding investors</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-indicted-in-7.php">report</a>] out of $7 billion. Last January, a federal judge ordered that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-orders-return-of-gold.php">$21.2 million in gold coins and bullion be returned</a> [JURIST report] to more than 200 of Stanford's investors. Weeks earlier, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/doj-investigating-financier-stanford.php">began investigating</a> [JURIST report] political donations and other connections between Stanford and US lawmakers. Stanford donated more than $2.3 million to lawmakers' campaigns and spent more than $5 million in lobbying efforts while allegedly carrying out the fraud. Stanford has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him and was originally set to be released on $500,000 bail until prosecutors successfully appealed the decision. Through three of his investment companies, Stanford allegedly violated the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/33Act.htm">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/34Act.htm">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/uscode15-80a-1.htm">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [texts].

The court found that the Bushmen have the right to use a previous borehole, that the government must pay the Bushmen's court fees and that the government's treatment toward the Bushmen has been "degrading." Citing the <a href = "http://www1.eis.gov.bw/EIS/Policies/Environmental%20Policies/CAP%2034-01%20Water%20Act.pdf">Chapter 34:01 Water Act</a> [text, PDF], the judge wrote:<blockquote>In my view, it cannot be emphasized strongly enough ... that in Botswana water is at a premium. Lawful occupiers of land such as the appellants must be able to get underground water for domestic purposes, otherwise their occupation would be rendered meaningless. Indeed, I accept that this is the rationale behind s 6 of the Act. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in concluding that the appellants, being the lawful occupiers, do not require a water right for the use of Mothomelo borehole, or indeed any other current or future borehole on land in the CKGR, for domestic purposes.</blockquote>A spokesperson for the Bushmen stated that they were "very happy" with the decision and hoped that "the government will now treat us with the respect we deserve." <a href = "http://www.survivalinternational.org/">Survival International</a> [advocacy website] also released a <a href = "http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6925">statement praising the decision</a> [text]. Jeff Ramsay, an official for the <a href = "http://www.gov.bw/en/Ministries--Authorities/Ministries/State-President/Office-of-the-President/Divisions/Media2/">Botswana Government Communications and Information System</a> [official website], said the <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110127/ap_on_re_af/af_botswana_water">government will respect the decision</a> [AP report].

<p>The Bushmen <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10720244">applied for permission to use a borehole</a> [BBC report], originally dug by diamond company <a href = "http://www.debeers.com">De Beers</a> [corporate website] in the 1980s, as a water well on their ancestral land located in the Kalahari desert. Judge Lashkavinder Walia originally <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCgZCKb8yh3A2lcxXk6nui_pvZCg">denied</a> [AFP report] the tribe's application, stating that they needed to specify how much water they intended to pump from the borehole in order to comply with water regulations. Tourist areas as well as diamond claims are located within miles of the game reserve, and the closest source of water for the Bushmen is 25 miles from their village. The Bushmen are considered to be the first inhabitants of southern Africa, with ancestors occupying the Kalahari Desert region for 20,000 years. The tribe was evicted from the game reserve from 1997 to 2002 and forced to reside in settlement camps. The Bushmen contended that the eviction was the result of the government attempting to make room for diamond claims and tourist areas, whereas the government cited the Bushmen's negative effect on conservation as the motivation behind the relocation. The borehole was sealed in 2002 in an additional effort to drive the tribe from the land. In 2006, the High Court <a href = "/paperchase/2006/12/botswana-high-court-rules-government.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government's eviction was "unlawful and unconstitutional" and allowed the Bushmen return to the area.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the agreement, Morlock, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in June in the deaths of three Afghan civilians in separate incidents between January and May, agreed to offer testimony against 10 fellow defendants in exchange for receiving a maximum sentence of 24 years imprisonment.  A military judge is expected to review the agreement at Morlock's court-martial, at which time Morlock's lawyers may request the judge to impose a lesser sentence.  The proceedings are scheduled for next month at Morlock's home base, <a href="http://info.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/">Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a> [official website].

<p>Investigations into Morlock's unit, the 5th Stryker Brigade, have led to charges against several soldiers.  Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrifying civilians.  Earlier in the week, the US Army had <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">ordered a court-martial</a> [JURIST report] for Staff Sgt. David Bram, who was accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep him from informing about alleged drug abuse within the unit.  The Army announced in May that its Criminal Investigation Command was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">opening an investigation into the civilian deaths</a> [JURIST report] in Kandahar.  The charges are the latest in a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  In April, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial.  Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">reduced from 15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi civilian.  In December 2009, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl.  Green was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-sentences-ex-us-soldier.php">five consecutive life terms</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution's office alleges Tymoshenko, whose government was dissolved in March after she narrowly lost the presidential election to <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], abused her authority and exceeded her official duties by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up while in office. Ukrainian prosecutors allege the vans were not properly equipped to function as ambulances and that the country suffered USD $67 million in damages as a result. Tymoshenko responded to the allegations calling them a <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_27_1_5">"fabrication"</a> [statement]. On her website, Tymoshenko said the purchase of the medical vans was part of a program to help people in the rural areas of Ukraine where medical centers are sparse:<blockquote>According to statistics, 60% of people who die in the villages die not because they're deathly ill, but because a doctor can't reach them in time, because there is no transportation in the villages and no way for a doctor or nurse to reach the sick. That's why we used state guarantees to purchase 1,000 vehicles for 3,000 villages that helped save more than 100,000 lives in 2010 alone.</blockquote>Tymoshenko also accused the Ukrainian government of political repression. If found guilty of the charges, she could face up to 10 years in prison. 

<p>This is not the first time the Ukrainian government has investigated Tymoshenko. In December, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">filed criminal charges against her</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly misappropriating state funds during her time in office from 2007-2010. In May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. The probe was initiated in May 2004 and then <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/ukraine-prosecutors-close-criminal.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in June 2005. Last February, Tymoshenko <a href="paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-challenging.php">withdrew</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-files-lawsuit-challenging.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] filed in the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine claiming that the country's presidential election was corrupt. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The council emphasized it may only interpret existing laws under the constitution, but that the legislature has the power to make new laws allowing gay marriage. A lawyer for the gay couple who brought the complaint said that the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/01/28/general-eu-france-gay-marriage_8280231.html">issue has been passed to the politicians</a> [AP report], and that he remains optimistic that the government may yet legalize gay marriage. Corinne Cestino and Sophie Hasslauer, who have lived together for 15 years and have four children, sought for the right to marry and challenged the ban in a Reims court, saying it <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/French-court-to-examine-legality-of-same-sex-marriage-ban/articleshow/6938061.cms#ixzz15eLrbzI5">limited their personal freedoms</a> [AFP report]. The <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a>  [official website, in French], the country's highest court of appeals, in November ordered the Constitutional Council to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/france-court-%20orders-review-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">rule on the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of the law. 

<p>Both foreign and domestic courts are increasingly having to rule on the issue of gay marriage. In the US, judges in <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">California</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/texas-appeals-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports] confronted the issue last year. Governments in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mexico-city-legislature-approves-same.php">Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/kenya-lawmakers-refuse-to-include-equal.php">Kenya</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/argentina-lower-house-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Argentina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/portugal-president-ratifies-same-sex-marriage-law.php">Portugal</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/germany-court-recognizes-foreign-same-sex-marriage-as-civil-union.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports] are also addressing the issue. In 2007, the French Court of Cassation ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/france-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">same-sex marriages were not valid under French law</a> [JURIST report] and that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. The case arose in 2004 when Stephane Charpin and Bertrand Charpentier were <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/frances-first-same-sex-marriage.htm">married</a> [JURIST report], after which both a local court and intermediate appeals court ruled that the marriage was invalid. State lawyers argued that it was not an issue for the courts to decide, but rather was a question to be answered by parliament. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The dismissal effectively exhausts Suu Kyi's ability to appeal and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12307838">bars her from official political recognition</a> [BBC report] in the country. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court agreed to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iWIrzdyXq8RYFn8hVOY3Vqj876AQ?docId=CNG.55c507d303160fbb5de1b214b3d1c635.251">hear a special appeal</a> [AFP report] from Suu Kyi, despite <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-court-dissmisses-suu-kyi-suit-over-party-dissolution.php">dismissing the case</a> [JURIST report] twice last year. Suu Kyi sought to reverse the government's decision to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11474823">formally abolish the party</a> [BBC report] after it had failed to register for elections. A lawyer for NLD said that they have still have <a href="http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4813-supreme-court-dismisses-nld-appeal-against-dissolution.html">one last appeal</a> [Mizzima report] to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but it unclear if the party will make the appeal.

<p>Suu Kyi originally filed the suit in <a href="/2010/11/suu-kyi-seeks-reinstatement-of-opposition-party.php">November</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/suu-kyi-files-suit-in-myanmar-to-stop.php">April</a> [JURIST reports], but both claims were dismissed. She had asked the court to annul the part of the election law that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">bars political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] from participating in elections and also to establish a parliament of lawmakers who won in the 1990 elections. The dissolution of the party was seen as political move by the military government in order to keep the NLD from participating in Myanmar's 2010 elections, the first in 20 years. Suu Kyi was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">released</a> [JURIST report] following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] last November after almost eight years of house arrest. Her release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court provided official notice of the charges against Mbarushimana, which include five counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes including murder, rape, torture, and attacks against the civilian population, and also informed him of his rights under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF]. In addition to denying the charges, Mbarushimana stated that he has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gdVV1wnAL5MqPk4JmJQYfTZM8ZXQ?docId=8fa99840b0e646e79f8d9413186e4c28">consistently fought injustice and human exploitation</a> [AP report] and that he strongly condemns attacks on civilians. Mbarushimana was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-authorities-arrest-drc-war-crimes-suspect-under-icc-warrant.php">arrested in October</a> by French authorities and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-transfers-congo-war-crimes-suspect-to-icc.php">transferred to the Hague</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this month on an order issued by the ICC. The ICC order stated that evidence supported the idea that Mbarushimana, in his role as Executive Secretary of the FDLR, "has personally and intentionally contributed to a common plan of conducting attacks against the civilian population in order to create a 'humanitarian catastrophe' and to launch an international campaign to extort concessions of political power for the FDLR." The ICC will hold a confirmation of charges hearing on July 4, 2011 in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that Mbarushimana committed each of the crimes charged. If the charges are confirmed, the case will be referred to the Trial Chamber for further proceedings. 

<p>In addition to facing allegations relating to violence in the DRC, Mbarushimana has also been linked to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. In December, a French judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-judge-charges-rwanda-rebel-leader-with-war-crimes-report.php">charged Mbarushimana</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the genocide. In 2008, Mbarushimana was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/rwanda-war-crimes-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested by German border police</a> [JURIST report] as he attempted to travel to Russia on charges that he killed 32 people during the Rwandan genocide. In 2005, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/un-to-ask-france-to-bring-case-against.php">asked France to bring genocide charges</a> [JURIST report] against Mbarushimana, who was then in the country under refugee status. Carla Del Ponte, the former chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website], refused to charge him and said the ICTR did not file an indictment against Mbarushimana because it lacked sufficient evidence against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision, which was split down party lines, will now advance to the state House of Representatives, where it needs a two-thirds vote to succeed. If approved there, it will need to be signed by <a href="http://governor.wy.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Matt Mead</a> [official website] and then appear as a referendum item on the 2012 ballot.

The Russian Federation Council on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/russia-parliament-approves-new-start-treaty.php">voted to ratify the treaty</a> [JURIST report]. The upper house of Russia's parliament unanimously supported the measure, which calls for each country to reduce its nuclear arsenal by about 30 percent. Under the new treaty, each country will be allowed to have 1,550 warheads as opposed to the 2,200 allowed under the old <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [materials] that expired in December 2009. Council-member <a href="http://council.gov.ru/staff/members/functionary1650210.html">Viktor Evtukhov</a> [official profile, in Russian] <a href="http://council.gov.ru/inf_ps/chronicle/2011/01/item15279.html">praised</a> [press release, in Russian] the ratification of the treaty stating, <blockquote>The conclusion of the START treaty is clearly the achievement of national policy. First, the ratification of the treaty will have a positive impact in all areas of bilateral cooperation the signing of START-3 completely draws a line under the Cold War. Secondly, the New START treaty fully meets the interests of Russia, who chose a less costly and more rational approach.</blockquote> Russia <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/7402191.html">included non-binding language in its ratification</a> [AP report] disapproving of US plans to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said that the treaty <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110126/162310669.html">will not affect Russian plans</a> [RIA Novosti report] to build a missile defense system. The US and Russia are <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70R2EN20110128?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">expected to hold a formal ceremony</a> [Reuters report] marking the treaty's ratification next month. 

<p>Russia's lower house originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-lower-house-quickly-approves-new-start-treaty.php">approved the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in December. Earlier that month, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-ratifies-russia-nuclear-arms-treaty.php">voted 71-26</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the treaty. US President Barack Obama and Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague in April. The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] last February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department began <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-judge-weighing-probe-of-us.php">originally filed in 2009</a> [JURIST report], accuses high profile lawyers including former attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4001393.stm">Alberto Gonzales</a> [BBC profile], David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">John Yoo</a> [JURIST news archive] of <a href="http://www.abc.es/20110128/espana/abci-guantanamo-201101281242.html">inventing a legal cover for torture at Guantanamo</a> [ABC report, in Spanish].

The case, although not the only Guantanamo-related lawsuit in international courts, may further heighten tensions between the US and Spain.

Farinas was detained for the first time Wednesday, in his home city of Santa Clara. He was released later that evening, then arrested Thursday and released again Friday morning. By Friday afternoon, he had been picked up a third time, as he defied the prohibition against gathering in public. Farinas, and those he gathered with, wished to place a wreath on a monument to Cuban independence leader <a href="http://www.josemarti.cu/">Jose Marti</a> [backgrounder, in Spanish] to commemorate the 158th anniversary of his birthday.

On Thursday, the diplomat was reportedly confronted by two armed men on motorcycles, who minutes earlier had robbed money and valuables at gunpoint from a Pakistani citizen in the same area. The embassy has said the man acted in self-defense when he shot and killed the two armed men. After being arrested, the man identified himself to police as a diplomat and cited his right to immunity under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> [text, PDF]. The US believes that police and senior authorities failed to check his status with appropriate channels, and formally arrested and remanded the diplomat in violation of international norms and the Vienna Convention, to which Pakistan is a signatory.

The proposed legislation, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/hb2562p.pdf">House Bill 2562</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/sb1308p.pdf">Senate Bill 1308</a> [text, PDF], are proposals to amend <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/arizonarevisedstatutes.asp?title=36">Title 36, Chapter 3 of the Arizona Revised Statutes</a> [materials]. The Arizona legislature, in introducing these bills, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/27/us-immigration-arizona-idUSTRE70Q7CY20110127">seeks a legal review</a> [Reuters report] of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution, which grants citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The bills aim to guarantee citizenship only to children born of at least one parent who is a legal citizen, legal immigrant, active member of the Armed Forces or a naturalized legal citizen, and would seek Congressional permission to issue two separate type of birth certificates, based on whether the child meets the new citizenship requirements or not. Opponents to the bill argue that creating two separate and distinct birth certificates <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2011/01/28/20110128birthright-citizenship-bill-arizona-spotlight.html">will create classes of people</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report], and brings to mind the policy of "separate but equal." Legislators are likely to vote on the bills in the next few weeks.

<p>In the past year, Arizona has found itself at the center of the immigration debate in the United States. In October, a judge for the US District Court in the District of Arizona <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/azd/CourtInfo.nsf/A85E29E4AC9B19EA072577B6007835F8/$file/10-1061-447.pdf?openelement">denied</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] motions to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the controversial Arizona <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>].

Hundreds of protestors, as well as seven presidential candidates, were arrested while protesting the results of the election, which declared incumbent Lukashenko the winner of the presidency for the fourth time with 79.7 percent of the vote. The government previously announced that the activists were being charged with organizing an unsanctioned meeting, a charge carrying a possible penalty of up to 15 years in prison. The <a href="http://minsk.usembassy.gov/election_violence122010.html">US</a> and <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/118650.pdf">EU</a> [press releases] have led an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gYHaqY8g2_oo5BWWFFEBxfXKhG-g?docId=CNG.83881cb4742d6ee8cf68ac1c3900d725.51">international condemnation</a> [AFP report] of the actions by the Belarusian police and have also questioned the legitimacy of the election results. The Belarusian <a href="http://www.kgb.by/belarus/">KGB</a> [official website, in Belarusian] announced the release of former presidential candidate Vladimir Neklyayev citing good behavior, but also noted that Neklyayev will remain under house arrest.  EU officials are expected to vote on reimposing the ban on visas on Monday. The previous ban on visas was lifted in 2008 in order to encourage reform within the country. 

<p><a href="/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were also arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports].While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report].

Speaking before a high level meeting on the situation in the Ivory Coast, Ban reiterated the UN's pledge to help resolve the tense situation in the country which has led to heightened violence and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-fears-genocide-possible-in-cote-divoire.php">fears that a genocide could occur</a> [JURIST report], as a result outgoing President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] refusing to leave office.

Ban also said that those responsible for the deaths of more than 260 people since December "must be brought to justice and held responsible for their crimes." 

<p>The UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-pledges-to-defend-Ouattara-and-warns-of-consequences-for-war-crimes-in-ivory-coast.php">pledged support</a> [JURIST report] for Ouattara in January, committing UN peacekeeping forces to his aid. The UN press release also noted reports of <a href="http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/15206">mass graves</a> [Newstime Africa report], and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] warned Gbagbo that he would be held accountable for continued post-election violence carried out in his name.

The comments come in the wake of a vote by Africa's foreign ministers, who on Friday supported Kenya's bid to defer the trials of numerous suspects who allegedly planned the <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/crisis-centre/crisis/kenya-violence?v=in_detail">2007 post-election violence</a> [Reuters backgrounder]. Ping <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/01/29/idINIndia-54506920110129">indicated</a> [Reuters report] that the AUC is not against the ICC, but just Moreno-Ocampo's involvement in it. Kenya awaits an approval from its head of state before it will invoke <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=276">Article 16</a> [text], which would allow the country to ask the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to have the case deferred or suspended. Kenya argues that its citizens should not be charged with crimes against humanity when people from other countries, such as Myanmar and Iraq, are not prosecuted by the ICC. Moreno-Ocampo previously rejected such criticism, noting the role of the ICC as a court of last resort for countries unable to prosecute supsects themselves. The Kenyan cases were refered to the ICC after they failed to be prosecuted locally. 

<p>Last months, the Kenyan Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kenya-lawmakers-approve-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion to withdraw the country from the ICC</a> [JURIST report]. The vote came a week after Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-accuses-6-kenyans-of-orchestrating-2007-post-election-violence.php">presented cases against</a> [JURIST report] six individuals believed to be responsible for the 2007 post-election violence that resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in the country. Although the vote was non-binding, it was a victory for the sponsor of the legislation, Isaac Ruto, who wants the six suspects to be tried in Kenya. The individuals being prosecuted include senior politicians and civil servants. Kenyan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7068055.stm">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [BBC profile] announced his opposition to leaving the ICC, stating that the trials will take place at The Hague. </p>]]></content:encoded>

President <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mwai+Kibaki">news archive</a>] announced on Friday the appointments of chief justice, top prosecutor, attorney general and budget chief. The appointments were made in an effort to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/kenyaNews/idAFLDE70S09N20110129?sp=true">increase public confidence</a> [Reuters report] in the judiciary and to pave the way for the possible prosecution of suspects accused of 2007 post-election violence. According to Odinga, the country's new constitution, which was created as <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kenya-president-opposition-reach.php">part of a power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] reached in 2009 following months of civil unrest, requires presidential appointments to be approved by the prime minister. Odinga indicated that the situation was a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gjdOs9ZdyFxYXCCFySS9cyEe7-MA?docId=CNG.4f79fd54def547db7a5c9f08426c8b87.c91">major setback to reform</a> [AFP report] that could lead to a legal crisis. He has threatened to block the appointments in court if they are not withdrawn.

<p>Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">ratified its new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in August, as part of a reform movement aimed at curbing vast presidential powers. Kenya's new constitution includes numerous checks on presidential authority, among which are the creation of a supreme court and senate. The new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">approved by popular referendum</a>, which took place amid concerns that high turnout and heated debate over the referendum could cause a repeat of the violence seen during the country's <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">presidential election</a> [JURIST reports] in 2007. The government is now expected to start implementing the new constitution, which could take as long as five years. This document has been received as one of the most significant events in Kenya since its independence. <br />

According to the council, the proposal, which entailed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12322151">cancellation of elections</a> [BBC report] scheduled for 2012 and 2017, was <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/kazakh_constitutional_council_rejects_referendum_to_extend_nazarbaev_rule/2292361.html">inconsistent with the constitution</a> [RFE/RL report]. In an address to citizens on Monday after the council's decision was announced, Nazarbayev said that in lieu of the referendum, which he said would divide society, he is now <a href="http://www.azattyq.org/content/kazakhstan_nazarbaev_has_announced_early_presidential_elections_instead_of_referendum/2292785.html">advocating for snap elections</a> [RFE/RL report, in Kazakh]. Nazarbayev has already expressed his intention to run for president again, and last week said he wants to lead the country <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110128/162344817.html">as long as his health permits</a> [RIA Novosti report].

<p>The referendum was <a href="http://www.constcouncil.kz/kaz/news/?cid=0&rid=672">forwarded</a> [press release, in Kazakh] to Kazakhstan's Constitutional Council after the <a href="http://www.parlam.kz/Information.aspx?lan=en-US">parliament</a> [official website, in Kazakh] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/kazakhstan-parliament-votes-on-presidential-term-extension-referendum.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] the proposal on January 14. The parliament's vote overruled Nazarbayev's decision earlier in the month to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70D2W920110114?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">veto the proposed referendum</a> [Reuters report]. Nazarbayev's current term is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hC0UZaZYP61Wl02Dqvs2siKnjthA?docId=CNG.c0a719d0daf7352ff943520a2d71d930.a1">set to expire in 2012</a> [AFP report], but, if the referendum had been been approved, he was poised to achieve a 30-year term in office. Supporters of the referendum said that it was <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=expert_opinions&news_id=248">necessary</a> [Interfax report] in order to ensure that Nazarbayev can continue to address issues facing the country. They also indicated that continuity of government was necessary for the country's continued growth. Opponents argued that Nazarbayev's political party was attempting to eliminate any political competition. The <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr">Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a> (ODIHR) [official website] emphasized the <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/74925">need for democratic elections</a> [press release], arguing that the proposed referendum "[did] not offer a genuine choice between political alternatives and would infringe on the opportunity of citizens to hold their representatives accountable and to effectively exercise their right to vote and be elected." In 2007, Nazarbayev <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/kazakhstan-president-approves.php">approved a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] removing term limits on his own presidency, effectively allowing him to remain president for life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/patterns-misconduct-fbi-intelligence-violations">report</a> [text] summarizes nearly 2,500 pages of government documents obtained by EFF through <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] litigation. Many of the documents are reports made to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/piab">Intelligence Oversight Board</a> (IOB) [official website], an independent agency within the office of the president that oversees the Intelligence Community's compliance with the Constitution and all applicable laws, executive orders, and presidential directives. The report states, "[t]he documents suggest that FBI intelligence investigations have compromised the civil liberties of American citizens far more frequently, and to a greater extent, than was previously assumed." According to the documents, the reported violations to the IOB included violations of intelligence procedures governing investigations and abuses of the FBI's National Security Letter authority, and nearly a fifth were violations of the Constitution, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act </a>(FISA) [text], or other laws governing criminal investigations. The FBI said the violations were <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fbi-violations-20110130,0,6047844.story">due to technical mistakes</a> [LAT report] and the amount of substantive violations is small.

<p>This is not the first time the FBI has faced allegations of illegal activity in the course of its investigations. Last September, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/doj-clears-fbi-of-wrongdoing-in-domestic-advocacy-group-probes.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] absolving the FBI of charges that agents conducted investigations of domestic groups based on their exercise of <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/print_friendly.html?page=bill_of_rights_transcript_content.html&title=The%20Bill%20of%20Rights%3A%20A%20Transcription">First Amendment</a> [text] rights. But the report criticized the FBI for beginning investigations on weak factual predicates, continuing investigations longer than necessary, inappropriately retaining information on file, misclassifying investigations, and probing issues of state, rather than federal, law. Also in 2007, the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/fbi-ignored-lawyers-warnings-on-phone.php">ignored growing concerns</a> [JURIST report] from its own lawyers and managers about the lawfulness of retrieving thousands of telephone records of US citizens between 2004 to 2006. The DOJ report by <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/glennfine.htm">Inspector General Glenn Fine</a> [official profile] on Patriot Act investigative practices revealed that the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/doj-review-criticizes-fbi.php">broke and misused laws</a> [JURIST report] in the process of obtaining personal information from telephone companies, Internet service providers, banks, credit bureaus and other business personal records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among the agencies affected are the <a href="http://www.cbi.iq/">Central Bank of Iraq</a>, the Supreme Commission of Human Rights, the <a href="http://www.ihec-iq.com/en/">Independent High Electoral Commission</a> (IHEC), the <a href="http://www.nazaha.iq/">Integrity Commission</a> [official websites], the Financial Inspection Office, and the Media and Communications Committee. The ruling, handed down two weeks ago, came at the request of Maliki, who had asked the court in December to clarify the government's role in the management of these bodies under the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/12/AR2005101201450.html">Iraqi Constitution</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+constitution">news archive</a>]. On Sunday, Maliki stated that challenging the ruling would be an impossible effort that would assail the legitimacy of the federal judiciary. The ruling has been criticized by Sinan al-Shebibi, Governor of the Central Bank, who has argued that the decision will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8h-h3ftciRwKfTOvCmRR5BJtHpA?docId=CNG.7bdc5ae33cb6afa079d4a84588e766f7.271">subject it to Iraq's international creditors</a> [AFP report]. The decision has also been criticized by a member of the IHEC, who has claimed that it will <a href="http://www.france24.com/ar/node/646912?quicktabs_1=0">adversely affect Iraqi democracy</a> [France24 report, in Arabic]. The Council of Representatives, which oversaw the functioning of the Central Bank before the ruling, will <a href="http://www.albaghdadia.com/n/iraq-polotics/23722-2011-01-26-10-43-24.html">hold an inquiry into the decision</a> [Al-Baghdadia report, in Arabic] on Tuesday.

<p>Maliki was recently able to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/iraq-parliament-approves-national-government-unity-agreement.php">form a coalition government</a> granting him a second term as prime minister following another <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-high-court-rules-delay-in-government-formation-unconstitutional.php">Supreme Court ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that ordered the parties to form a government nine months after the March <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/special/misc/iraqielections2010/">parliamentary elections</a> [CEIP backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">news archive</a>]. In November, Iraqi parliamentary officials unanimously approved the power-sharing agreement whereby Maliki and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile] will remain in power for an additional term, despite tension over governmental power positions for the country's minority Iraqiya alliance leader, <a href="http://www.ayadallawi.com/">Iyad Allawi</a> [official website; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/2010329495420860.html">profile</a>]. According to the basic terms of the deal, a new governmental office, the National Council for Strategic Policies, was created and led by Allawi as a check on the prime minister's power. The new agreement marked a significant step for the Iraqi government after months of political unrest following the elections. Key positions of ministers of defense, intelligence, security and interior remain unfilled following the deal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-genocide-court-indicts-4-ex-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in September, and they argue that court rules require a trial to begin within four months of indictment, rendering their continued detainment unlawful. In addition to the alleged rule violation, the lawyers argued that their clients' age and declining health should be taken into consideration, with both Chea and Thirith leaving the courtroom early on account of health conditions. The prosecution, on the other hand, maintains that no rules were broken and that continued detainment is not only lawful but also necessary, citing the possibility of public outrage if the suspects were released. A fourth individual, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ieng+sary">Ieng Sary</a> [JURIST news archive], was indicted in September as well, but he does not seek release and was absent from the hearing. The court is expected to rule on the request in February.

<p>In October, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] said that the ECCC will decide whether to prosecute additional Khmer Rouge officers. Ban spoke to reporters after visiting a genocide museum in Phnom Penh and said that the ECCC would decide if there will be more prosecutions as part of an "international judicial process." Beforehand, while speaking in front of the court, Ban called for those responsible to be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4878">held accountable</a> [text] for the tragic events that allegedly caused the death of more than two million civilians between 1975 and 1979. Ban also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36580&Cr=cambodia&Cr1=">praised</a> [UN News Centre report] the ECCC's work in pursuing justice, even 30 years after the fall of the regime, and asked for the government's "full cooperation" with the tribunal and "complete respect for its judicial independence." Ban's support followed comments by Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile], in which Hun Sen said that the Cambodian government will <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/cambodia-pm-rejects-further-prosecution-of-khmer-rouge-officials-by-un-tribunal.php">not allow the UN tribunal to continue prosecuting</a> [JURIST report] former Khmer Rouge officials because the cases disturb the country's ongoing peace process. Hun Sen was formerly a Khmer Rouge officer along with many of his closest allies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://robertamsterdam.com/thailand/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ICC-Petition-Final-with-Appendix.pdf">application for petition</a> [text, PDF] cites specific evidence developing a substantial basis to show that international crimes of murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivation of physical liberty, other inhumane acts, and persecution were committed in conjunction with the suppression of red shirt protests. Evidence obtained from multiple active-duty officers of the <a href="www.rta.mi.th/">Royal Thai Army</a> [official website, in Thai] recounts the planning and execution of the military response to the red shirts. The application also includes reports from Thai law enforcement officials knowledgeable of the official investigation conducted by the Thai Department of Special Investigations (DSI) into the killings of protesters. Representing the red shirts and the <a href="http://www.uddthailand.com/">United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship</a> (UDD) [advocacy website], Robert Amsterdam stated:<blockquote>This case represents a historic opportunity for international justice to confront governments who deploy their militaries to use violence against their own citizens. In light of repeated violent crackdowns throughout Thai history, this legal filing represents the first comprehensive attempt to obtain the facts and evidence of what happened during the 2010 massacres, let alone publish them before the public. What we have exposed is not just a botched security operation, but rather a determined policy of extermination and elimination of the Red Shirt movement by the military. These egregious violations require answers and accountability.</blockquote>Amsterdam's firm, <a href="http://www.amsterdamandperoff.com/">Amsterdam &#38; Peroff, LLP</a> [law firm website] also represents former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+Shinawatra">news archive</a>], a figurehead for the democratic red shirts, who is currently living in exile after being ousted during a <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">2006 coup</a> [JURIST report]. In August, the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/thailand.htm#ConstitutionalCourt">Supreme Court of Thailand</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-supreme-court-dismisses-ex-pms-asset-seizure-appeal.php">denied Thaksin's appeal</a> [JURIST report] contesting the seizure of his assets. In July, the criminal division of Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/thailand-court-issues-new-arrest-warrant-for-ex-pm.php">issued a new arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] against him and Thai police recommended <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/336995,terrorism-indictment-former-premier.html">terrorism charges</a> [DPA report] against Thaksin and 24 others for their alleged involvement in the Bangkok protests.

<p>In March, the red shirts began <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thailand-government-approves-use-of.php">protesting the current Thai government</a> [JURIST report] and called for elections. The conflict, leaving more than 80 dead, ended after nearly two months when <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-government-imposes-curfew-in-bangkok.php">protesters surrendered to police</a> [JURIST report]. In May, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacywebsite] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-fears-ill-treatment-of-imprisoned-thai-protesters.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the treatment of anti-government protesters detained during the political violence. The group chided the Thai government for enacting an emergency decree giving Thai security forces broad power to arrest individuals without formal charges and hold them in secret detention. Thai <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abhisit+Vejjajiva">news archive</a>] promised an <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-pm-promises-independent-probe-of-recent-violent-protests.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the clashes between security forces and the red shirts. Abhisit discussed plans for reconciliation aimed at helping the country heal and pledged that due process of law would play an important role in the reconciliation, and that all people would be encouraged to participate in the democratic process. During their protests, the red shirts demanded that Abhisit resign and called for new elections. The Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-government-imposes-curfew-in-bangkok.php">implemented a curfew</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and other areas of the country in response to violence that erupted when the leader of the red shirts announced an end to the protests. It was later <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-anti-government-leaders-plead-not-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

USA, a case regarding the constitutionality of the military's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) policy [10 USC &#167; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don't+ask+don't+tell">news archive</a>]. The government's <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/03/10-56813_Abeyance.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] requested that the court suspend its own appeal of an <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Central District of California</a> [official website] requiring the US military to end enforcement of DADT. In November, the government requested and received a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">stay</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] that suspended enforcement of the injunction. The government requested that the appeal be placed on hold in light of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [text and materials], which President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] on December 22.  The government argued that moving forward with the appeal would interfere with the repeal schedule that the Act sets in place.  In January, the government requested and received a delay in the case's briefing schedule, but Friday's motion reset the schedule. The government's opening brief is now due on February 25. The <a href="http://www.logcabin.org/site/c.nsKSL7PMLpF/b.5468093/k.BE4C/Home.htm">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website], the conservative gay activist organization that brought the suit, stated that it was <a href="http://www.logcabin.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=nsKSL7PMLpF&b=6420733&ct=9096599">pleased</a> [press release] with the court's decision:<blockquote>We are pleased by the Ninth Circuit Court's ruling denying the government's motion to stay its own appeal of a lower court decision declaring 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' unconstitutional. The government should not have appealed in the first place and has been trying ever since to dealy any decision by the Ninth Circuit. Now, the Justice Department has to file its brief in the appeal in a few weeks and it will be very interesting to see how the government will try to argue, as it must, that DADT is constitutional.</blockquote>The group stated it had made an offer to delay the appeal while the act is implemented if the government agreed to cease further to discharges under DADT. The group called the government's decision not accept the offer "unfortunate and inexplicable."

<p>The act states that the repeal of DADT will become effective 60 days after the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense</a> [official profile] receives a plan for the repeal's implementation from the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] and the plan is approved by Obama, the Secretary of Defense and the chairman of the <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/">Joint Cheifs of Staff</a> (JCS) [official website]. Until that time, the current DADT policy is to remain in effect.

In a letter responding to the European Commission's request for more information regarding the law, Navracsics continued to defend the law but said his government would make modifications if it is found to violate EU law. The new law creates the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media and Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the new law, the government can fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority, whose members are all loyal to the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Rovat=10036">Fidesz party</a> [party website, in Hungarian]. Apart from freedom of expression concerns, the law also appears to apply to media companies both inside and outside Hungary, which violates EU regulations, as broadcasters are only to be subject to the rules of the country in which they are established. Communications Chief Zoltan Kovacs told public radio MR1-Kossuth that Hungary's response would address all the commission's concerns and that the government was <a href="http://www.mr1-kossuth.hu/hirek/kulhon/kovacs-zoltan-a-mediatorveny-celjairol-az-unesco-konferenciajan.html">open to consultation</a> [MR1-Kossuth report, Hungarian] and change if necessary. 

<p>Throughout the month of January, the Hungarian government has continued to defend its controversial law in the face of criticism from the Hungarian media and other EU governments. The law officially entered into force earlier in January, and Hungary has said the law conforms to EU norms and contains passages present in similar legislation of other member states. The state secretary for communication, Zoltan Kovacs, has also told national radio that it is <a href="paperchase/2011/01/hungary-defends-controversial-media-law-in-face-of-eu-criticism.php">unnecessary to change the law</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">Hungarian Parliament </a>[official website, in Hungarian] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BK6KF20101221">approved the law</a> [Reuters report] in December, amid protests and criticism. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Connecticut announced in June that it would lead a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">multi-state investigation</a> [JURIST report] against Google for possible privacy law violations. Under the agreement, Google will not be required to produce the information it collected. Instead, Google must only <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/lib/ag/press_releases/2011/012811GoogleStipAttach.pdf">stipulate</a> [text, PDF] that its Street View cars did collect data that contained data and private information. Jepsen expressed his belief that choosing negotiations over court proceedings is the right course of action for the state: <blockquote>This is a good result for the people of Connecticut. The stipulation means we can proceed to negotiate a settlement of the critical privacy issues implicated here without the need for a protracted and costly fight in the courts, although we are ready to do so if we are unable to come to a satisfactory agreement through negotiation</blockquote>In light of Connecticut's investigation, Jepsen has <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/lib/ag/press_releases/2011/012811dataprivacy.pdf">urged Connecticut residents</a> [press release, PDF] to protect their personal and communications data by securing their wireless networks.

The lawsuit was joined by 26 states and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website] and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last March. The suit challenged the constitutionality of the health care reform law and sought an injunction and declaratory relief. Judge Roger Vinson held that requiring all Americans over the age of 18 to have health insurance violated the Constitution by exceeding Congress' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] power: <blockquote>I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate. That is not to say, of course, that Congress is without power to address the problems and inequities in our health care system. The health care market is more than one sixth of the national economy, and without doubt Congress has the power to reform and regulate this market. That has not been disputed in this case. The principal dispute has been about how Congress chose to exercise that power here.</blockquote>Vinson found that the individual mandate is "unconstitutional and not severable," declaring the entire act void. The decision may be appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges across the country. A Virginia appeals court is scheduled to hear challenges to two conflicting lower-court rulings in May&#8212;one upholding the legislation and the other invalidating part of it. In December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">individual mandate provision is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but left the remainder of the law intact. Earlier that month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A US trial to revoke Egner's citizenship was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/us-nazi-death-idUSTRE70U6D720110131">scheduled to begin on February 22</a> [Reuters report] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website].  Documents filed in the court showed that a pretrial conference and a telephone conference scheduled last week were canceled.  Egner was accused of being a part of <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005130">Einsatzgruppen</a> [USSHM backgrounder], a German military unit blamed for the deaths of more than 17,000 Serbian Jews and other minorities during Germany's occupation of Serbia in World War II. Egner admitted to US federal officials in 2007 that he had been a member of the squad, which is alleged to have rounded up women and children in specially modified vans to gas them with carbon monoxide.

<p>In November, the Serbian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/serbia-requests-extradition-of-accused-nazi-living-in-us.php">filed documents</a> [JURIST report] seeking Egner's extradition from the US to Serbia so he could stand trial on war crimes charges. Serbia's <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Office the War Crimes Prosecutor</a> [official website] announced in 2009 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-to-seek-us-extradition-of-nazi.php">ask the US</a> [JURIST report] for Egner's extradition. In July 2008, Serbian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-nazi-guards-living-in-us-may.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that they were gathering evidence for a case against Egner. Earlier that same week, the DOJ filed a <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/library/alleged_nazi_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking to revoke Egner's US citizenship. Egner became a US citizen in 1966 but failed to disclose his Nazi service on his citizenship application. The DOJ argued that he was ineligible for citizenship both because of his service and because he concealed that information on his application.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." Additionally, it would allow religious institutions within the state to choose whether to observe or officiate the union. Opponents fear that this bill will move Illinois closer to legalizing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] and will threaten the sanctity of marriage. The new law will take effect on June 1. 

<p>Illinois is the seventh US jurisdiction to legalize same-sex civil unions. The Illinois legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/illinois-legislature-approves-same-sex-civil-unions.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] and sent it to the governor in December. In September, 13 state attorneys general <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/states-file-amicus-brief-against-california-same-sex-marriage-decision.php">joined in an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overturn a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">federal district court decision</a> [JURIST report] striking down California's ban on same-sex marriage. The brief argued that the district court exceeded its authority because a federal court cannot "reorder this foundational legal and social institution." In July, Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov">Governor Linda Lingle</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed same-sex civil unions. In contrast, several jurisdictions in the US have legalized same-sex marriage. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">DC</a> became the sixth US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriages, joining <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/01/2044344/italian-court-convicts-ex-guantanamo.html">accused Nasri of working for a terror group</a> [AP report] associated with al Qaeda while living in Milan in the 1990s. The US <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">transferred Nasri</a> [JURIST report], who was arrested in Afghanistan, from Guantanamo Bay to Italy in 2009 along with <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/148-adil-mabrouk-bin-hamida">Abdel Ben Mabrouk</a> [NYT materials] as the part of the government's plan to shut down the detention center. Nasri's lawyer said he plans to appeal the conviction.

<p>The continued operation of Guantanamo Bay remains controversial. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized US President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility. Obama's stated desire to close Guantanamo has faced heavy opposition in Congress. In early January, Obama signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the US for trial. The legislation authorized funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs and barred the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and limited funds available for transfers to foreign countries. The administration plans to seek the repeal of these restrictions and opposes the extension or expansion of them in the future. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].

Judge B Lynn Winmill's ruling <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-01/judge-tosses-challenge-to-idaho-roadless-plan.html">upholds Idaho's plan</a> [AP report] to manage its 9 million acres of forests across the state. The <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a> (NFS) [official website] issued the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&navid=091000000000000&pnavid=null&ttype=roadmain&cid=FSE_003853&position=RELATEDLINKS&pname=Roadless-Home">Roadless Area Conservation Rule</a> [text] in 2001, which prohibited the building of roads or the use of roadless lands in National Parks for timber production. It is currently in force in all states except Idaho and Alaska's <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/">Tongass National Forest</a> [official website]. Idaho created its own roadless rule that the <a href="http://wilderness.org/">Wilderness Society</a>, <a href="http://wilderness.org/">Greater Yellowstone Coalition</a> (GYC), and the <a href="www.sierraclub.org">Sierra Club</a> [advocacy websites] were challenging. The groups <a href="http://www.greateryellowstone.org/issues/lands/Feature.php?id=286">argue</a> [GYC backgrounder] that Idaho's version of the rule gives less protection to about 5.3 million acres of roadless forests than the 2001 federal rule with some areas removed from all protections. Idaho's rule was backed by federal land and wildlife managers. The ruling is being <a href="http://risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=6c466b36-02e5-49d5-992f-db6acc3539d2">hailed</a> [press release] by US Senator <a href="http://risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Home">James Risch</a> (R-ID) and <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor CL Otter</a> (R) [official websites] who say it is an example of state's ability to create their own environmental regulations.

<p>Last February, a federal judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-upholds-rule-limiting.php">granted summary judgment </a> [JURIST report] for the NFS, upholding an agreement limiting the amount of timber that can be harvested in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. Several Alaska towns and companies challenged the 2008 forest plan, which, among other things, designated parts of the forest "old growth reserves," limiting the amount of timber that could be harvested. In 2009, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-prohibits-construction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a ruling reinstating the 2001 Roadless Rule. The Clinton administration measure was effectively overturned in 2005 by the <a href="http://fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5052609.pdf">State Petitions Rule</a> [text], enacted by the US <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> [official website] under then-president George W Bush. The State Petitions Rule allowed governors to petition for Roadless Rule protections, depending on their individual state needs, in lieu of blanket protection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protest movement in Tunisia ousted former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile], sending him into exile, and the UN reported this week that at least 219 have died as a result of the protests, including 72 killed in prison riots. In two reports this week, HRW is calling on the transitional government to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/29/tunisia-hold-police-accountable-shootings">investigate incidents of police violence against protesters</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/31/tunisia-end-police-attacks-protesters">end police brutality</a> [HRW reports]. It claims that a vast majority of protester deaths are due to police gunfire on crowds. They are urging the government to punish police action that goes beyond what is necessary to perform their duty. Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East and North Africa director, issued a statement:<blockquote>Things are moving fast in Tunisia, but finding out who opened fire on demonstrators and why can't wait. The units and commanders responsible for these apparently unlawful killings should be identified and held accountable.</blockquote>A unity government has taken control and the new Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi has promised that there will be elections within six months.

<p>Last week, Tunisia's Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi announced that the country has <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-former-president.php">issued an international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for ousted president Ben Ali. He, his wife and other family members face allegations that they <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-LwuYrv8kNfnY_cE6P_9SnMC9Qg?docId=CNG.189a3a1fe5c8bba71806f5a7de2822bc.671">illegally transferred money</a> [AFP report] out of the country, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/26/tunisia.warrant/">possessed unlicensed weapons</a> [CNN report] and incited armed violence. Earlier this month, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner on Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-rights-chief-to-send-human-rights-mission-to-tunisia.php">announced that UN experts would be sent to Tunisia</a> [JURIST report] to assess the human rights situation and meet with the country's interim leaders. Also, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] has urged government leaders in Tunisia to initiate dialogue between all sides in an attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-secretary-general-calls-on-leaders-in-tunisia-to-restore-rule-of-law.php">restore the rule of law</a> [JURIST report]. The Tunisia Constitutional Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">officially announced</a> earlier this month that Ben Ali had permanently left the office of the presidency after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST reports] and left the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

There are currently unconfirmed reports of 300 casualties and 3,000 injured. Citing <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Article 21 of the of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text], Pillay stated that the will of the people should determine the government:<blockquote>The authorities have a clear responsibility to protect civilians, including their right to life, and to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. People must not be arbitrarily detained, simply for protesting or for expressing their political opinions&#8212;however unwelcome those opinions may be to those in power.</blockquote><a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] has announced that he will <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112221313603381.html">not seek re-election</a> [speech transcript], although he does not plan on stepping down nor leaving Egypt. Protesters were not mollified by this statement, and protests have increased substantially since his speech. The protesters released their <a href = "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT_PROTEST_DEMANDS?SITE=ILEDW&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">official demands</a> [AP report], which include the removal of Mubarak and no transfer of power to his son, Gamal; negotiations with the military only after Murbarak's departure; and free and fair elections for the presidency and parliament.

<p>As of Thursday, more than 1,000 protesters have been reported as <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/over-1000-detained-in-egypt-amid-widespread-protests.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] as demonstrations against the 30-year reign of Mubarak continued. Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Egyptian opposition leader <A href = "http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-bio.html">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> [Nobel Prize profile] expressed his <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12300164">willingness to lead a transitional government</a> [BBC report]. Elbaradei, who previously led the <a href = "http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website], returned to Egypt and is reported to have joined the protests. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is modeled after recent civil unrest in Tunisia that culminated with the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report] The similarities between recent protests was analyzed by Forum contributing editor <a href = "http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L Ali Khan</a> [academic profile], professor of law at Washburn University in the op-ed <A href = "/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

CCR argued that the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) and <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.01927:">Protect America Act</a> (POA) [S 1927 materials], which allowed the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] to wiretap suspected terrorists without a warrant, chilled the CCR's ability to speak freely with its clients and probably intercepted communications that were subject to the attorney-client privilege. Judge Vaughn Walker, noting that the TSP was discontinued in 2007 and the POA <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/bush-says-no-compromise-possible-on.php">expired in 2008</a> [JURIST report], ruled that CCR lacked standing to challenge the programs since it could not show its communications had actually been intercepted as required to state a claim under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text] or that it had suffered any harm. Walker explained: "In short, plaintiffs have not shown that they personally have suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct, especially in light of the clear precedent requiring that the allegations of future injury be particular and concrete. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to establish standing for their First Amendment claim" [citations omitted]. CCR Senior Attorney Shayan Kadidal expressed displeasure with the ruling, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-warrantless-wiretapping-case-dismissed-federal-judge">saying</a> [press release], "It is astonishing that President Obama's administration continues to fight to hold on to the fruits of a patently illegal surveillance program, even where that surveillance was directed at attorneys engaged in suing the government."

<p>In October, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-guantanamo-wiretapping-appeal.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in a case brought on behalf of CCR lawyers who sought to learn under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) whether the NSA had recorded their conversations with clients detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. The petition for <em>certiorari</em> followed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-foia.php">2009 decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] that a FOIA exception allows the NSA and <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to withhold information or confirmation of the existence of information obtained by an intelligence program. In 2009, former DOJ attorney John Yoo <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/bush-administration-lawyer-defends.php">defended the use of warrantless wiretaps</a>, saying laws preventing them were outdated and contributed to the government's inability to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In April 2009, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-limits-nsa-surveillance-after.php">announced that it had limited</a> [JURIST report] the NSA's electronic surveillance after finding the NSA had committed privacy violations, but maintained that the information being received was still important.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report claims that the Iraqi Army's 56th Brigade controls the secret prison located in Camp Justice, and that Iraqi authorities ordered 280 detainees transferred there from Camp Honor in November 2010 days before international inspectors were to visit Camp Honor. The HRW report found that the 56th Brigade tortured suspects at Camp Honor, echoing a <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/23/world/la-fg-iraq-prison-20110124"><em>Los Angeles Times</em> report</a> [text] from last week. The <em>Times</em> found that the Camp Honor jail is run by the 56th Brigade rather than the Ministry of Justice, that prisoners face inhumane conditions, are held indefinitely and are often denied access to family members and lawyers. According to the HRW report, personnel in the overcrowded Camp Honor extracted confessions from suspected terrorists by beating them, suffocating them and making threats against their families. Deputy Justice Minister Buso Ibrahim <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hnsRxLFhauRMjkw9rIhvjv4C4kPw?docId=CNG.85bc84cf65dec965e2307bfe85784c7f.a41">denied the <em>Times</em> report</a> [AFP report] last week, claiming that inmates can communicate with lawyers and family members and that they do not face torture or inhumane conditions. Ibrahim claimed the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [advocacy website] had visited Camp Honor, but the ICRC denied this, saying that it canceled the planned visit because the Iraqi government wanted to restrict its ability to talk to prisoners. Deputy Middle East director at HRW Joe Stark commented, "Revelations of secret jails in the heart of Baghdad completely undermine the Iraqi government's promises to respect the rule of law. The government needs to close these places or move them under control of the justice system, improve conditions for detainees, and make sure that anyone responsible for torture is punished."

<p>In October, UN High Commissioner for Civil Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for the US and Iraq to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-iraq-abuses.php">investigate and prosecute</a> [JURIST report] those responsible for alleged abuses that came to light after <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] released documents showing extensive human rights abuses in Iraq and accusing US forces of turning prisoners over to Iraqi forces despite knowing those prisoners were likely to face torture. Days earlier, HRW called for the Iraqi and US governments to <a href="/2010/10/us-iraq-governments-urged-to-investigate-reports-of-detainee-abuse.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] and prosecute those responsible for alleged detainee abuse. The group said the WikiLeaks reports detail the US military's failure to prevent abuses, including beatings, burnings and lashings, of Iraqi detainees at the hands of their captors. In September, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iraq-unlawfully-holding-torturing-thousands-of-detainees-report.php">accused the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] of illegally detaining over 30,000 people and torturing many of them. Last April, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">accused Iraqi authorities of torturing detainees</a> [JURIST report] in another secret prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hood is seeking a federal judge to direct <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Kenneth_R._Feinberg">Kenneth Feinberg</a> [WP profile], administrator of the $20 billion fund established by <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] in the wake of the disaster, to remedy inadequate claims mechanisms and expedite the processes.  The filing alleges that Feinberg has yet to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/02/us-oil-spill-mississippi-idUSTRE71113Y20110202">establish a claims process</a> [Reuters report] consistent with the standards outlined in the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> [materials], state laws and the company's earlier promises.  Hood contends that the $3.3 billion GCCF has paid to individual and business claimants represents only a fraction of the victims seeking relief and the damages claimed, and that monitoring the process is significantly inhibited by a lack of transparency.   

<p>The <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/">National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</a> [official website] released its <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report">full final report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/national-commission-on-bp-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-releases-final-report.php">report</a>] earlier this month, tracing the deeper root causes of the spill and recommending steps to avoid future incidents.  In October, several environmental advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/environmental-groups-sue-bp-for-oil-spill-harm-to-endangered-species.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against BP for the ongoing harm to endangered and threatened wildlife caused by the spill.  The GCCF, an independent facility, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website].  Alabama <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Attorney General Troy King</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. In June, two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">filed against BP</a> [JURIST report] alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.] statute. The lawsuits allege that BP purposefully defrauded the American public in order to increase company profits. Also in June, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the DOJ is reviewing whether any <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">civil or criminal laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP resulting in the oil spill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was signed into law by Nazarbayev after unanimous approval by both houses of parliament. On Monday, Kazakhstan's <a href="http://www.constcouncil.kz/kaz/main/">Constitutional Council</a> [official website, in Kazakh] rejected a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/kazakhstan-constitutional-court-rejects-referendum-to-extend-presidency.php">proposed referendum</a> [JURIST report] extending Nazarbayev's presidency until 2020. Following the council's decision, Nazarbayev announced a proposal for <a href="http://www.azattyq.org/content/kazakhstan_nazarbaev_has_announced_early_presidential_elections_instead_of_referendum/2292785.html">snap elections</a> [RFE/RL report, in Kazakh] during an address to the citizens of Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev's current term in office expires in 2012 and he has already expressed his intention to run for president again in the upcoming election. A date for the new elections has not yet been announced but may be scheduled for as early as this spring.

<p>The proposed referendum was <a href="http://www.constcouncil.kz/kaz/news/?cid=0&rid=672">forwarded</a> [press release, in Kazakh] to Kazakhstan's Constitutional Council after the parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/kazakhstan-parliament-votes-on-presidential-term-extension-referendum.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] the proposal on January 14. The parliament's vote overruled Nazarbayev's decision earlier in the month to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70D2W920110114?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">veto the proposed referendum</a> [Reuters report]. Supporters of the referendum <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=expert_opinions&news_id=248">maintain that it is necessary</a> [Interfax report] in order to ensure that Nazarbayev can continue to address issues facing the country. They also indicated that continuity of government is necessary for the country's continued growth. Opponents have argued that Nazarbayev's political party is attempting to eliminate any political competition. The Kazakhstan Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kazakhstan-parliament-approves-plan-for-presidential-term-extension-referendum.php">initially approved</a> [JURIST report] the referendum last month. In June 2010, Nazarbayev announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kazakhstan-president-declines-to-sign-bill-extending-powers.php">would not sign a controversial law</a> [JURIST report] that would grant him several presidential powers for life, even if he stepped down from office.<br />

The report titled "The 'Anti-Nationals': Arbitrary Detention and Torture of Terrorism Suspects in India",  accuses Indian security forces at all levels of arbitrary arrests, detention, torture and religious discrimination in the aftermath of three deadly bombings of major Indian cities in 2008, for which the <a href="http://www.idsa.in/backgrounder/IndianMujahideen">Indian Mujahideen</a> [IDSA Backgrounder] took responsibility. The report also addresses the treatments of Hindu nationalists suspected to be responsible for a separate 2008 bombing.  According to the report, suspected terrorists are labeled "anti-national", held without bail, often jailed without being registered and forced to give confessions to crimes.  Lawyers who represent the suspected Muslim terrorists operate in an environment of open hostility, with several bar associations issuing instructions to their members to not represent the suspected terrorists. HRW also criticizes magistrates for not ordering independent investigations and ignoring the complaints of the suspected terrorists.  The report takes aim at state and federal laws that facilitate the abuse of terrorism suspects.  The <a href="http://164.100.47.4/Bios_Search/Bill_texts_pre.aspx?Bill_ID=3230&House=Lok%20Sabha">Amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a> (UAPA) [legislative materials] are criticized for vague definitions of terrorism, increased police powers and extending the pre-detention period for suspected terrorists  to 180 days. HRW analogizes these amendments to the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/POTA.htm">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a>, a law that was repealed in 2004 because it encouraged abuse. Among its many recommendations HRW urged Indian government at all levels to repeal unlawful provisions that encourage abuse, enact a Prevention of Torture Bill and investigate allegations of abuse by police. 

<p>The Indian government has faced both international and domestic criticism for its anti-terror laws. In December 2010, Amnesty International] criticized <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/india-court-sentences-rights-activist-to-life-in-prison.php">the guilty verdict for Binayak Sen</a> [JURIST report] on charges of aiding rebels of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/india/terror-groups-india/p12773#p4">Naxalite Maoist rebellion</a> [CFR Backgrounder]. In 2008, AI urged Indian <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/profile.html">President Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil</a> [official website] to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/12/rights-group-urges-india-president-to.php">reject</a> [JURIST report] the UAPA Amendment of 2008. The bill, which came in response to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+terror+attacks">news archive</a>]. Proponents of the UAPA have said that there are safeguards in place to make sure that the law is not misused. In 2006, the opposition <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP) [party website], alleged that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm">Mumbai train bombings</a> [BBC report] were <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-government-urged-to-revive.php">a fallout from</a> [JURIST report] the country's Prevention of Terrorism Act, set aside by the incumbent United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in 2004.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitri Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dmitri+medvedev">news archive</a>] signed a bill into law last week <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/russia-president-signs-bill-ratifying-new-start-nuclear-treaty.php">ratifying the treaty</a> after the Russian Federation Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/russia-parliament-approves-new-start-treaty.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] the treaty's ratification. The new treaty, which replaces the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START 1) [materials] that expired in December 2009, calls for each country to reduce its nuclear arsenal by about 30 percent and allows each country to maintain a nuclear arsenal of 1,550 warheads, as opposed to the 2,200 allowed under START 1. The treaty, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">agreed to</a> [JURIST report] in February, also allows for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12348780">visual inspections of nuclear capabilities</a> [BBC report] in order to verify compliance with the treaty's terms. The previous right of mutual inspection of the nuclear arsenals <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/02/obama.start/">ended</a> [CNN report] with the expiration of START 1. New START will formally go into effect on Saturday when US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> and Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bul_ns_en.nsf/kartaflat/en03.01">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profiles] exchange the signed documents. 

<p>New START is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. In December, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-ratifies-russia-nuclear-arms-treaty.php">voted 71-26</a> to ratify the treaty after the Russian Duma <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-lower-house-quickly-approves-new-start-treaty.php">voted overwhelmingly for approval</a> [JURIST reports] earlier in the month. US approval of the treaty came after some members of the legislative body <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-senator-predicts-no-approval-of.php">expressed doubt</a> [JURIST report] that the Senate would have the 67 votes required for approval. Obama and Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty in April</a> after the US State Department began <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">negotiating the treaty</a> [JURIST reports] with Russia in 2009.  Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abu Ali was convicted in November 2005 on <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-bush-assassination-plot.php">nine charges</a> [JURIST report] related to conspiracy to commit terrorist acts, including plotting to assassinate then-president George W. Bush. Attorneys for Abu Ali argued that the life sentence was unconstitutional and procedurally and substantively unreasonable, though the court ruled that the sentence fell within "well-established boundaries" and did not reflect an abuse of discretion.

<p>Abu Ali's original sentence of <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-bush-assassination.php">30 years imprisonment</a> [JURIST report], imposed in March 2006, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/us-usa-security-abuali-idUSTRE7109K320110201">increased to life</a> [Reuters report] following a successful appeal in 2008 brought by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website]. Sentencing proceedings were initially <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/judge-orders-abu-ali-sentencing.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] to allow lawyers in the case time to investigate whether evidence against Abu Ali had been obtained through warrantless domestic surveillance. His conviction came after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/federal-judge-allows-alleged-torture.php">denied</a> Abu Ali's motion to suppress his confession, which he claimed was a <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/student-accused-in-bush-assassination.php">byproduct of torture</a> [JURIST reports] at the hands of Saudi Arabian domestic security police.

John Kalymon, found to have personally shot Jews while serving in the UAP between 1942 and 1944 and participated in various violent anti-Jewish operations, will be deported to Germany, Ukraine, Poland or any other country that will admit him. UAP documents revealed that Kalymon took part in round-ups and forced transports of Jews repeatedly over two years. US Immigration Judge Elizabeth Hacker <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/02/AR2011020204544.html">rejected</a> [AP report] Kalymon's defense request for a mental-competency hearing because his dementia prevented him from testifying, ruling that he had adequate and competent legal counsel to represent him. Kalymon plans to appeal the order to the Board of Immigration Appeals or the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy for the Criminal Division's <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/hrsp/">Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section</a> (HRSP) [official website] Eli Rosenbaum said, "Ivan Kalymon was part and parcel of the Nazi machinery of persecution that ended the lives of more than 100,000 men, women and children in L'viv." Kalymon, now 89, immigrated to the US from Germany in 1949 and gained US citizenship in 1955. Hacker found that, when applying for his immigration visa, Kalymon concealed his UAP service. In 2004, the DOJ filed suit to revoke Kalymon's US citizenship. In 2009, the DOJ announced the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/doj-seeks-deportation-of-michigan-man.php">initiation of removal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Kalymon. 

<p>The DOJ's HRSP handles cases, including Kalymon's, aimed at denaturalizing or deporting former Nazis and other human rights violators who participated in wartime persecutions. Last May, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/sibpages/phi/phimain.htm">Philadelphia Immigration Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-immigration-court-orders-deportation-of-ex-nazi-guard-to-austria.php">ordered the deportation</a> [JURIST report] of former SS guard Anton Geiser to Austria for serving as an armed guard at the Sachsenhausen and the Buchenwald concentration camps during World War II. The court found that Geiser is removable under the 1978 Holtzman Amendment to the <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/uscode/8usc/www/contents.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [text] because a visa may not be granted to anyone who was involved in persecutions based on race, religion, or national origin. In 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-revokes-us-citizenship-of.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] Geiser's US citizenship because he had obtained it illegally. In May 2009, the DOJ succeeding in <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/accused-nazi-guard-deported-to-germany.php">deporting</a> [JURIST report] accused Nazi war criminal <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] to Germany to face trial. Earlier that year, German prosecutors charged Demjanjuk with 27,900 accessory counts stemming from his alleged involvement as a guard at the <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor</a> [Death Camps backgrounder] concentration camp where more than 260,000 people were executed in gas chambers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During a recent council meeting with Russian <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>], council member Tamara Morshchakova, a former judge for the <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/Pages/Default.aspx">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Russian] announced that the Council is <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/10194">planning to submit special analysis</a> [transcript, in Russian] for certain high-profile cases, including those of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, as well as Hermitage Capital lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Magnitsky">Sergei Magnitsky</a> [JURIST news archive]. Morshchakova said:<blockquote>The Council plans to submit to you expert legal analysis in connection with specific cases causing public outcry or defining trend of judicial practice. ... [M]aterials will be presented to Council shortly in connection with the case of well-known business lawyer Magnitsky. A similar expert analysis is being prepared by the Council on the relatively recent verdict in the case of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. It is clear that expert legal analysis of such processes may not have direct legal consequences. But it's is certainly intended that the state authorities take necessary response action, if the legal review of these processes are inconsistent with the law.</blockquote>Morshchakova also noted the council put forth a proposal to expand the use of jury trials in Russia. According to her, juries are an effective measure to fight corruption and develop a truly independent justice system. In particular, the Council's proposal seeks to increase the use of jury trials in cases involving murder, bribery and some types of economic crimes. 

<p>In January, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev's lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/khodorkovsky-appeals-extended-sentence.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging their six-year extended sentences for embezzlement and fraud. Unless the appeal succeeds, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are expected to remain imprisoned through 2017 after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] in the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovinchesky District Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on charges connected with his embezzlement of more than $27 billion from Yukos oil. Prior to this conviction, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were already serving eight-year prison sentences for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. Magnitsky was arrested after <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/20/AR2011012005687.html">implicating Russian police</a> [WP report] in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal, while working as outside counsel for the London-based investment fund <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Management</a> [corporate website]. Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. It is suspected that torture played a part in his death. In January, Magnitsky's former colleague William Browder announced that a group of independent UN human rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-rights-experts-to-investigate-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">experts will investigate</a> [JURIST report] the well-known lawyer's 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-lawyer-death-prompts-criticism.php">prison death</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Citing an intention to facilitate transparency, District Judge Carl Barbier ruled that the GCCF, a $20 billion fund established by BP to aid victims of the spill, is a "hybrid entity" that is not completely independent from BP. As such, <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Kenneth_R._Feinberg">Kenneth Feinberg</a> [WP profile], the fund's administrator, may not identify himself as a neutral third-party and must make clear that he represents BP in the company's efforts to satisfy its obligations as required by the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> (OPA) [materials]. Feinberg has previously asserted his neutrality to encourage claimants to accept lesser settlements, and it is believed that the ruling will lead to a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110203/ap_on_bi_ge/us_gulf_oil_spill_claims">rise in lawsuits</a> [AP report] against the company by victims who are less inclined to settle. Barbier also ordered lawyers to prepare briefs by the end of next week on whether BP's actions to this point in processing claims and settling with victims are sufficient to meet its legal responsibilities.

<p>On Tuesday, Mississippi <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] asked the same court to order the GCCF to fulfill its legal obligations to aid victims of the spill and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-ag-seeks-to-remedy-deficiencies-of-bp-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">remedy inadequate claims mechanisms</a> [JURIST report]. The GCCF <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website]. Alabama <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Attorney General Troy King</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. In June, two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">filed against BP</a> [JURIST report] alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations </a>(RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.] statute. The lawsuits allege that BP purposefully defrauded the American public in order to increase company profits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sebelius</a> [materials], the Commonwealth of Virginia's challenge to the recently enacted <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>]. In December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/12/13/va.healthcare.ruling.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] that the minimum coverage mandate provision of the law is unconstitutional. He left the rest of the law intact, holding that the coverage mandate was severable. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/11.html">Surpeme Court Rule 11</a> [text] allows the court to exercise direct discretionary appellate jurisdiction over cases with exceptionally far-reaching or urgent public policy implications. According to Cuccinelli, "a case cannot have public policy implications that are more important" than those at stake in the case:<blockquote>Given the uncertainty caused by the divergent rulings of the various district courts on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [PPACA], we feel that it is necessary to seek resolution of this issue as quickly as possible. Currently, state governments and private businesses are being forced to expend enormous amounts of resources to prepare to implement a law that, in the end, may be declared unconstitutional. ... We did not make this decision lightly. Given his unique responsibilities to fund and implement PPACA as Governor of Virginia, Governor McDonnell is particularly concerned about the possibility of wasting precious and strained taxpayer dollars preparing for a law that may well be struck down.</blockquote>The court's exercise of Rule 11 jurisdiction has been exceedingly rare, occurring only "upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance to justify deviation from normal appellate practice."</p>

<p>There are currently cases in 28 states challenging the provisions of the PPACA. Earlier this week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8DMNTD/$file/VinsonRuling1312011.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] the law as an unconstitutional overreaching of Congress' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell II backgrounder] power. The entire law was voided in that case, as the judge there found  the mandate to be unserverable. That decision is expected to be appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Earlier in January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The display, called "Philosophies of Law in Conflict," includes two columns bearing the headings "Moral Absolutes: The Ten Commandments" and "Moral Relatives: Humanist Precepts" and was situated above a sign encouraging readers to ask <a href="http://www.richlandcountyoh.us/cpc.htm">Richland County Common Pleas Court</a> [official website] Judge James DeWeese for additional information. The court rejected DeWeese's argument that the display is protected private religious expression and held that despite "replacing the word religion with the word philosophy," the display "sets forth overt religious messages and religious endorsements" in a public forum adjacent to a sitting judge.

<p>The Sixth Circuit in June <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sixth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-ten-commandments-in-kentucky-courthouses.php">upheld an injunction against similar displays</a> [JURIST report] in two Kentucky courthouses, finding that they represented simply another strategy "in a long line of attempts" to comply with the Constitution for litigation purposes and did not "minimize the residue of religious purpose." A month earlier, the same court denied an <em>en banc</em> rehearing in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0006p-06.pdf">another case</a> [opinion, PDF] involving the display of the Ten Commandments in a Grayson County, Kentucky, courthouse. The court found the display to be constitutional because it presented a valid secular purpose from the outset. In a 2005 decision, the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/ten-commandments-display-ruling-stirs.php">ruled in favor of a Ten Commandments display</a> [JURIST report] in a Mercer County, Kentucky, courthouse. A 2005 Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rejects.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting an earlier attempt at a similar display in Kentucky prompted lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/lawmakers-propose-amendment-to.php">propose a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] to overturn it. On the same day it issued that ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that a <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-high-court-allows.php">six-foot-tall display of the Ten Commandments</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds of the Texas state capitol was constitutionally acceptable because it had a secular purpose.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit alleged that Countrywide lured borrowers with low teaser rates prior to the mortgage crisis. The loan officers did not warn borrowers of the downside of these loans, leading tens of thousands of homeowners into foreclosure. Following the settlement, <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala D. Harris</a> [official website] <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/news/press_release?id=2031">announced</a> [press release] that the money would be used to a establish a statewide Foreclosure Crisis Relief Fund, which will help California residents affected by the mortgage crisis and high foreclosure rates. According to the settlement, <blockquote>At its discretion, the Office of the Attorney General may use the Fund to cover expenses it incurs in the course of investigating and prosecuting misconduct relating to mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, and foreclosures, and for consumer education regarding mortgage issues...The Office of the Attorney General, at its discretion, may also use these funds to develop and implement programs to help neighborhoods impacted by foreclosure or mortgage default rates.</blockquote> The court will maintain jurisdiction over the matter to ensure that the orders of the judgment are properly carried out.

<p>The decision is among several lawsuits relating to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Last month, the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/index.html">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.universalhub.com/2011/us-bank-national-association-trustee-vs-antonio-ib">decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/massachusetts-high-court-rules-against-banks-in-crucial-foreclosure-case.php">report</a>] against banks in two foreclosure cases that could have important implications on similar cases both inside and outside of the state. In December Arizona <a href="http://www.azag.gov/meet_the_ag.html">Attorney General Terry Goddard</a> [official profile] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/arizona-ag-sues-bank-of-america-for-mortgage-fraud.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/homepage/overview.go">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website] for misleading customers in mortgage modification and foreclosure practices. Specifically, the <a href="http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/dec/2010/BofAComplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] alleged that BOA violated a 2009 consent agreement, in which it agreed to develop and implement loan modification programs, by continuing to engage in widespread consumer fraud by misrepresenting to Arizona customers whether they were eligible for modifications of their mortgage loans. Additionally, in July 2010, The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [government website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/sec-citigroup-settle-for-75-million.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it charged <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup Inc.</a> [official website] with misleading investors about the company's exposure to sub-prime mortgage-related assets and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-136.htm">settled with the company</a> [press release] for $75 million. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Agreeing with an <A href = "/paperchase/2011/01/kenya-pm-calls-recent-presidential-appointments-unconstitutional.php">earlier pronouncement</a> [JURIST report] by <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/02/kenya.marktran">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile; JURIST <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Raila+Odinga">news archive</a>], Justice Daniel Musinga ruled in favor of eight advocacy groups, largely devoted to women's rights, which alleged that recent appointments violated promises of equality. Musinga found that Kibaki's appointments violated Article 27(3) of the <A href = "http://www.nation.co.ke/blob/view/-/913208/data/157983/-/l8do0kz/-/published+draft.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF], which states, "[w]omen and men have the right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres." Musinga declared that the error lied in Kibaki not consulting Odinga and other officials enough in the appointment process. The <a href = "http://www.communication.go.ke">Office of Public Communications</a> [official website] released a <a href = "http://www.communication.go.ke/media.asp?id=1260&media_type=2">statement</a> [text] following the announcement of the ruling: "President Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga had held extensive consultations prior to the announcement of the names on Friday evening." Although the High Court is the final arbiter on matters of constitutional interpretation, Musinga <A href = "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/Court-revokes-Kibaki-nominations-11535.html#ixzz1CuMIkLHM">stated</a> [<em>Capital News</em>], "unless the Speaker points out the unconstitutionality of such debates then the court cannot sit back and allow such violation." The Legislative Speaker of <a href = "http://www.bunge.go.ke/">Parliament</a> [official website], Kenneth Marende, was <A href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE71100Z20110202">expected to rule</a> [Reuters Africa] on the issue Thursday, but declined and <a href = "http://www.nation.co.ke/blob/view/-/1101022/data/233933/-/68o2iq/-/speakers%2527+ruling.pdf">directed the issue to two committees</a> [speaker's ruling, PDF]. The Justice and Legal Affairs committee and Finance Planning and Trade committee will research and deliberate on the issue, and announce their decision next week.

<p>Kenya <A href = "/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">ratified its new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in August, as part of a reform movement aimed at curbing vast presidential powers. Kenya's new constitution includes numerous checks on presidential authority, among which are the creation of a supreme court and senate. The new constitution was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">approved by popular referendum</a>, which took place amid concerns that high turnout and heated debate over the referendum could cause a repeat of the violence seen during the country's <a href = "/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">presidential election</a> [JURIST reports] in 2007. The government is now expected to start implementing the new constitution, which could take as long as five years. This document has been received as one of the most significant events in Kenya since its independence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECHR refused to grant the Government's request that a terror suspect be required to show that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to ill-treatment. The ruling lowered the suspect's burden of proving that he would be faced with ill-treatment upon returning to his home country. The reviewer of the sixth annual report, <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3756858.ece">Lord Carlile of Berriew</a> [Times  profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=carlile">news archive</a>], concluded that, despite political controversy and court decisions that challenged the system's goals, the control order system functioned well in 2010:<blockquote>[I]t is my view and advice that abandoning the control orders system now would have a damaging effect on national security. Of course, on their own control orders are not a failsafe or foolproof mechanism for full disruption of suspected terrorists. Further, because they are a resource-intensive tool for all involved in their management, self-evidently they cannot be used to manage the risk posed by all non-prosecutable suspected terrorists against whom there is robust intelligence.</blockquote>Carlile also called for a formal system for briefing political leaders to inform the debate on a possible replacement for the control order system.

<p>In January, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/home-secretary/">UK Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/press-releases/ct-powers">announced proposed changes</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uk-government-proposes-revised-control-order-policy.php">report</a>] to Britain's anti-terrorism policies, including the controversial use of control orders. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR45/012/2010/en/bbaadcd1-28fe-491f-9e4a-1550e63fbed9/eur450122010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/uk-control-orders-violate-suspects-rights-ai.php">report</a>] in August calling for an end to the use of control orders against terrorism suspects, characterizing the orders as legal sanctions without trial. A month prior, the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/civilappeals.htm">UK Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/869.html">ruled</a> [judgment, text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-appeals-court-rules-terror-suspects-may-sue-over-wrongful-control-orders.php">report</a>] that two terrorism suspects could sue the government for damages over wrongfully imposed control orders. In June, the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-supreme-court-rules-curfew-restrictions-violated-appellants-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a control order requiring an anonymous appellant to live 150 miles from his family and operate under a 16-hour curfew violated his rights under the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text]. In September 2009, then-Home Secretary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2091320.stm">Alan Johnson</a> [BBC profile] said the government would <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-government-to-review-control-order.php">undertake a review</a> [JURIST report] of the system. The UK Law Lords ruled in October 2007 that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-top-court-limits-control-orders.php">government may continue to impose control orders</a> [JURIST report] on terror suspects in lieu of detention, but said that some elements of the orders violate human rights. Control orders allow the British government to conduct surveillance and impose house arrest on suspects where there does not exist enough evidence to prosecute. The orders can also be used to forbid the use of mobile phones and the Internet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table> A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] heard arguments Wednesday on a new challenge to the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act of Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [materials]. Arguing before Judge John Bates, officials representing Shelby County, Alabama, together with a corps of conservative activists, argued that it is no longer constitutionally justifiable to subject Alabama and certain other states&#8212;virtually all Southern&#8212;to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> [DOJ backgrounder] pre-clearance rules under the VRA, requiring them to clear changes in voting districts, polling places and other electoral processes with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] or federal courts. The VRA was enacted to put an end to the systematic disenfranchisement of minority voters that ran rampant in Southern districts in the 1960s. Although the Senate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/washington/21vote.html">extended the act</a> [NYT report] an additional 25 years by an overwhelming 98-0 vote in 2006, its basis in a legacy of discrimination evidenced more than 45 years ago has gone largely unexamined. Bates <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g2ODzmtPO-690RGlrS_4WDXyBo0A?docId=ed9ac25967d145be963695f97d067187">expressed doubt</a> [AP report] at the notion that the policy considerations underlying the VRA could be considered salient by the end of the extension, 70 years after its enactment. The DOJ argued that the act remains justified by a continued, observable pattern of more subtle means of racial discrimination at the polls in the Section 5 districts. Civil rights groups point to a 2009 case in which the DOJ <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/metro.ssf?/base/news/1237968933248260.xml&coll=2">invalidated</a> [<em>Birmingham News</em> report] the 2006 redistricting of Calera, Alabama that eliminated the city's only majority-black district and cost black incumbent Ernest Montgomery his council seat.

<p>Bates' comments echoed similar sentiments expressed by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] last year when it <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>] a controversial provision of the VRA in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-322">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In that most recent challenge to the VRA, the court voted 8-1 in favor of permitting the appellant municipality to "bail out" from the Section 5 pre-clearance requirement if it can establish a history of compliance with the VRA, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of the 25-year extension of the act. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts opined that "things have changed in the South," observing that "[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare." The plaintiff was a municipal utility district in Texas that wanted to be exempted from the requirement and was challenging the most recent extension generally. At their enactment in 1965, the requirements were only supposed to be in place for five years. Section 5 has since been extended several times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Martin Feldman found that the government violated his <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/GENERAL/Notices/10-1663_doc67.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] to lift a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/obama-announces-new-regulations-stemming-from-gulf-oil-spill.php">six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling</a> [JURIST report] when US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] issued a new moratorium that was substantially the same as the previous one and that it would cause the same financial injury to the industry as the first moratorium. In holding the DOI in civil contempt, Judge Feldman ruled:<blockquote>Each step the government took following the Court's imposition of a preliminary injunction showcases its defiance: the government failed to seek a remand; it continually reaffirmed its intention and resolve to restore the moratorium; it even notified operators that though a preliminary injunction had issued, they could quickly expect a new moratorium. Such dismissive conduct, viewed in tandem with the reimposition of a second blanket and substantively identical moratorium and in light of the national importance of this case, provide this Court with clear and convincing evidence of the government's contempt of this Court's preliminary injunction Order.</blockquote>Feldman referred the matter to a magistrate judge to determine the amount of fees to be paid. 

<p>Feldman <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-reinstate-original-drilling-moratorium.php">refused to reinstate the moratorium</a> [JURIST report] last year at the request of advocacy groups such as the <a href="http://www.defenders.org/index_v2.html">Defenders of Wildlife</a> [advocacy website], which also argued that the judge should be disqualified from the case because he owned stock in several oil and drilling companies. Feldman <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/judge-refuses-to-withdraw-from-drilling-ban-case.php">refused to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in July, the Obama administration asked a federal appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">reinstate the original six-month drilling moratorium</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the ban should be upheld because the government would likely win its appeal of the lower court's ruling. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] originally asked the court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">stay the preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] in June, on the basis that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. Lawyers for the DOJ also claimed that that the district judge abused his discretion in issuing the injunction. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was a result of an oil well blowout that caused an explosion 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf. More than 120 million gallons of oil leaked from the rig's broken pipe causing the spill to surpass the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez</a> [JURIST news archive] as the worst oil spill in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay condemned Thursday's  <a href="http://www.hmlc-egy.org/node/1656">arrest of 20 activists and lawyers</a> [HMLC news release] from the <a href="http://www.hmlc-egy.org/">Hisham Mubarak Law Centre</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] in Cairo. Staff members from the international rights organizations <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites] were <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/human-rights-activists-detained-egypt-must-be-freed-2011-02-04">among those detained</a> [AI press release] at the law center. Pillay emphasized the importance of protecting human rights during a time of political change in the region: <blockquote>Governments should listen to their people, and start addressing their human rights deficits immediately. Waiting until unrest actually happens is, as we have seen in Tunisia and are now seeing in Egypt, not only perpetuating systems that to a greater or lesser degree transgress international laws and standards, it is also a classic case of acting too little, too late. We now see there is an intense hunger for human rights in the Middle East and North Africa - and of course in other countries in other regions. Governments who ignore these extremely loud and clear warning signals, are doing so at their own peril.</blockquote>Pillay also urged the Egyptian government to maintain open communications and protect media outlets, criticizing the government's "hijacking" of cell phone company <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/content/index.html">Vodaphone</a> [corporate website] in order to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/03/AR2011020301846.html">send political text messages</a> [WP report] to citizens. 

<p>Demonstrations against the 30-year reign of Egyptian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/over-1000-detained-in-egypt-amid-widespread-protests.php">began last week</a> [JURIST report] and have become more violent since Mubarak announced Tuesday that although he will <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112221313603381.html">not seek re-election</a> [speech transcript], he does not plan on stepping down nor leaving Egypt. Some reports allege as many as <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110203/162441336.html">300 deaths and 1,500 injuries</a> [Ria Novosti report] as a result of the protests. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Egyptian opposition leader <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-bio.html">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> [Nobel Prize profile] last week expressed his <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12300164">willingness to lead a transitional government</a> [BBC report], has returned to Egypt and is reported to have joined the protests. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">closely related to the recent civil unrest in Tunisia</a> [JURIST op-ed] that culminated last month with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The detainee, Awal Gul, had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002, suspected of having <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF]. Gul died on Tuesday of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises. The CCR believes that the circumstances surrounding Gul's death illustrate the inherent problem with the detention center and the policy the US follows in detaining and indefinitely holding suspected terrorists, claiming that the facility has become a purgatory, where people are held indefinitely:<blockquote>Awal Gul's death illustrates too well what Guantanamo has become - a prison where Muslim men are held indefinitely until they die because the president lacks political courage to release or charge them in any forum. President Obama must close Guantanamo lest more detainees die there, including roughly 90 men who are approved for transfer at some undetermined point in the future.</blockquote>Gul's attorney also released a statement, echoing many of the same issues raised by the CCR and taking issue with the DOD's press release which included claims against Gul that were not raised while he was alive.

<p>As the number of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility decreases, the issue of what to do with those remaining in US custody continues to be a significant issue. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign. Earlier last month, Obama signed a defense authorization bill that <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">prohibits the transfer of detainees to the US for trial</a> [JURIST report], further confusing the future of the 177 men currently at the facility. In an effort to reduce the population at the facility, the US has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-to-algeria-a-year-after-habeas-order.php">transferring detainees</a> [JURIST report], some to their native countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Geele was <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/component/content/50908.html?task=view">convicted</a> [<em>Copenhagen Post</em> report] on Thursday on charges of attempted murder and terrorism for <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/denmark-prosecutors-add-terrorism.php">breaking into</a> [JURIST report] Westergaard's home and threatening him with an axe and knife. In issuing its ruling, the court stated that Geele's attack amounted to an attempt to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14818503,00.html">destabilize Danish society</a> [DW report] and terrify the public. Upon completion of his sentence, Geele will face permanent expulsion from Denmark and deportation to Somalia. Lawyers for Geele had requested a lesser sentence of six years without deportation, expressing fear for Geele's safety if deported to Somalia due to present dangers in the war-torn nation. Geele's lawyers have announced that they will appeal the sentence. 

<p>Westergaard's 2005 picture of the Muhammad was one of a series of caricatures published by a Danish newspaper that infuriated Muslims around the world. Many Muslims consider depictions of Muhammad offensive, and when other newspapers reprinted the caricatures in 2006 it triggered violence in several countries, leading to multiple <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muhammad-cartoons-furor-kills-15-in.php">deaths</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muslim-cartoon-protestors-burn-danish.php">burning of Danish embassy buildings</a>[JURIST reports], and boycotts of Danish goods. In April, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/dutch-court-acquits-arab-group-of-hate.php">Dutch court acquitted</a> [JURIST report] the Arab European League (AEL) on charges of making discriminatory and defamatory statements against Jews when they posted a cartoon on their website that insinuated that the Holocaust was fabricated. The AEL argued that they posted the cartoon in response to what they saw as double standard in the distribution of Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad even though they did not actually deny the historical facts of the Holocaust.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Petitioner Dr. Rafik Sabir argued that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002339---B000-.html">18 USC &#167; 2339B</a> [text], the statute under which he was convicted of attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, was "unconstitutionally vague and overbroad" and that the evidence presented a trial was insufficient to support his conviction. Sabir specifically challenged the lower court's finding that providing medical treatment was the equivalent of providing "material support" to a terrorist organization. He argued that he had an ethical duty as a physician to offer medical treatment to those in need. The court rejected Sabir's arguments stating that the record did not support the characterization of Sabir's activities as merely meeting an ethical obligation. The court held: <blockquote>Sabir was not prosecuted for performing routine duties as a hospital emergency room physician, treating admitted persons who coincidentally happened to be al Qaeda members. Sabir was prosecuted for offering to work for al Qaeda as its on-call doctor, available to treat wounded mujahideen who could not be brought to a hospital precisely because they would likely have been arrested for terrorist activities.</blockquote>The court concluded that Sabir's actions went beyond honoring his Hippocratic oath, to swearing an allegiance to al Qaeda as "one of the soldiers of Islam." The court also rejected arguments that he was denied a fair trial and that district court abused their discretion in addressing alleged juror misconduct. 

<p>Sabir, a US citizen, was <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/florida-doctor-convicted-of-conspiracy.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on the terrorism-related charges by a federal court in 2007. He was <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/two-us-citizens-charged-with.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] in May 2005 following several meetings with an undercover FBI agent posing as an al Qaeda recruiter, during which Sabir pledged his loyalty to al Qaeda and agreed to provide medical assistance to wounded terrorists in Saudi Arabia. A second defendant, Tariq Shah, who was also caught in the FBI sting pleaded guilty in 2007 to providing material support to al Qaeda. Shah, who had agreed to teach hand-to-hand combat to al Qaeda operatives, is serving a 15-year sentence. Sabir is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200916216.pdf">revived</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit against <a href="http://www.drummondco.com/">Drummond Company</a> [corporate website] alleging that the company hired Colombian paramilitaries to assassinate plaintiffs' fathers. The plaintiffs brought suit against Drummond under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Torts Statute</a> (ATS) [28 USC &#167; 1350], the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/get_external.cgi?type=pubL&target=102-256">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> (TVPA) [materials], which allows US citizens to sue for terrorist acts committed by US firms abroad, and the wrongful death laws of Colombia. The <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] had <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/DrummondII.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] the suit, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit in federal court and that some of the claims were barred by <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/res_judicata"><em>res judicata</em></a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In reversing the ruling, the Eleventh Circuit found that the plaintiffs had met the requirements of standing under the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">Constitution</a> [text], holding that, due to the deaths of their fathers, the plaintiffs' legal rights had been violated, the violation was traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and monetary damages would be appropriate if liability was established. The court then held that the plaintiffs could bring suit as wrongful death claimants under the ATS and TVPA and that their claims were not subject to <em>res judicata</em>. The court explained in regard to the ATS claim:<blockquote>[T]he complaint alleges an intricate and vindictive plot, orchestrated by the defendants, that ultimately led to the assassinations of the [plaintiffs'] fathers. If true, such conduct establishes a violation of international law sufficient for purposes of triggering ATS liability. It is thus no surprise that the Northern District of Alabama concluded in prior litigation against these defendants that this misconduct would constitute a violation of the law of nations sufficient to fit within the ATS.</blockquote>The plaintiffs alleged that after Drummond employees in Colombia successfully unionized, the company paid the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/colombia/farc-eln-colombias-left-wing-guerrillas/p9272">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CFR backgrounder] to break up the union and murder its leaders, plaintiffs' fathers. 

<p>In April, victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/chiquita-sued-in-us-court-for-aiding.php">filed suit against Chiquita Brand International</a> [JURIST report], which has admitted to funding the AUC. In the complaint filed in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website], 242 Colombians alleged that they had been seriously injured or had family members killed by the group. The AUC has been accused of mass killings during the Colombia guerrilla warfare movement before disarmament in 2003. The plaintiffs, who are seeking over $1 billion in damages, brought suit under the TVPA. Last February, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-allows-suit-against.php">allowed a lawsuit to go forward</a> [JURIST report] accusing Chiquita of assisting Marxist rebels who killed Colombian missionaries. Chiquita admitted it had paid AUC for protection of its workers but it argued that it did not condone the killings. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after it admitted to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to AUC. Following that admission, hundreds of family members of Colombians killed by FARC filed lawsuits in the US against Chiquita under the ATS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement includes <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/americas/Cuba-to-Release-2-Political-Prisoners-115278709.html">allowing Angel Moya to stay in Cuba</a> [VOA report] and Guido Sigler to go to the US.

So far, most have been released on the condition that they relocate with their families to Spain. Moya's wife is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jmna515JWJs4aT97MF4oA6EZw-9A?docId=CNG.df91623da6926ca3cdfc80280770bcac.571">one of the leaders</a> [AFP report] of the <a href="http://www.damasdeblanco.com/">Ladies in White</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish] which is composed of relatives of the jailed dissidents. Sigler and Moya are part of the 52 prisoners authorities Cuba <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cuba-agrees-to-release-52-political-prisoners.php">agreed to free</a> [JURIST report] in July. Authorities indicated their refusal to leave Cuba <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12368275">resulted in their delayed release</a> [BBC report]. The nine remaining prisoners have likewise refused to leave Cuba, and no date has been set for their release. 

<p>Cuba continues to face criticism for its human rights record including claiming that the Cuban government repressed dissidents and violated fundamental civil liberties. In November, Havana released the only other dissident who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/cuba-releases-first-dissident-prisoner-refusing-exile-bargain.php">permitted to stay in Cuba</a> [JURIST report], reportedly because of advanced age. In October, dissident Guillermo <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/cuba-activist-awarded-top-eu-human-rights-prize.php">Farinas was awarded the Sakharov Prize</a> [JURIST report], given to those who work for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In July, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cuba-frees-first-of-52-political-prisoners-scheduled-to-be-released.php">first of the prisoners was released</a> [JURIST] a few days after the original deal was brokered. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sabri is currently 32 years old and has been held for more than eight years in the <a href="currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> detention facility. The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/02/05/2051678/guantanamo-hold-of-yemeni-captive.html">ruling</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] by Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/urbina-bio.html">Ricardo Urbina</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] was issued under seal, and it is not presently known why or which parts of the Pentagon's allegations he found convincing. District court judges have now upheld the detention of 21 individuals and allowed for the release of 38 others, with several cases being appealed.

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to highlight what it claims are <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-responds-death-of-awal-gul-guantanamo-bay">problems with the detention system</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">report</a>] currently used by the US for dealing with suspected terrorists. The deceased, Awal Gul, had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002, suspected of having <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF]. Gul died on Tuesday of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises. The CCR believes that the circumstances surrounding Gul's death illustrate the inherent problem with the detention center and the policy the US follows in detaining and indefinitely holding suspected terrorists, claiming that the facility has become a purgatory, where people are held indefinitely. What to do with Guantanamo detainees remaining in US custody continues to be a significant issue. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href="paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign. Earlier last month, Obama signed a defense authorization bill that <a href="paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">prohibits the transfer of detainees to the US for trial</a> [JURIST report], further confusing the future of the 177 men currently at the facility. In an effort to reduce the population at the facility, the <a href="paperchase/2011/01/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-to-algeria-a-year-after-habeas-order.php">US has been transferring detainees</a> [JURIST report], some to their native countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the security conference in Munich, US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] and Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profile, Russian] exchanged documents that finalized two years of negotiations aimed at improving relations between the two nations and marked the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/05/us-russia-usa-start-idUSTRE7141ED20110205?pageNumber=1">entering into force</a> [Reuters report] of the treaty. The nuclear disarmament treaty calls for each country to reduce its nuclear arsenal by about 30 percent and allows each nation to have 1,550 warheads as opposed to the 2,200 allowed under the old <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [materials], which expired in December 2009.

<p>In January, Russian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dmitry-medvedev">President Dmitri Medvedev</a> [Guardian profile; JURIST <a href="jurist_search.php?q=dmitri+medvedev">news archive</a>] signed into law a bill that ratified the New START treaty. The Russian Federation Council voted to <a href="paperchase/2011/01/russia-parliament-approves-new-start-treaty.php">ratify the treaty</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. Russia's lower house originally <a href="paperchase/2010/12/russia-lower-house-quickly-approves-new-start-treaty.php">approved the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in December. Earlier that month, the US Senate <a href="paperchase/2010/12/senate-ratifies-russia-nuclear-arms-treaty.php">voted 71-26</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the treaty. US President Barack Obama and Medvedev <a href="paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague in April. The agreement, <a href="paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] last February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department began <a href="paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Keith Starrett ruled that plaintiffs, Mississippi <a href="http://www.ltgovbryant.com/">Lt. Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official website] and 10 other Mississippi residents who filed the <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/assets/pdf/DB16992623.PDF">complaint</a> [text, PDF], failed to show they have legal standing pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html">Article III</a> [text] of the Constitution to challenge part of the health law that requires people to purchase insurance or face tax penalties. The plaintiffs argued that the "probability of injury" resulting from non-compliance with the legislation was sufficiently certain or imminent, and therefore met standing requirements. The defendants argued that the alleged injury, though economic, was too remote to confer standing. The court agreed that the plaintiffs' allegations were insufficient to show "certainly impending" injury. Starrett gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint.

<p>There are currently cases in 28 states challenging the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On Thursday, <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/Cuccinelli/AG_Bio.html">Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/020311_HealthCare_Expedited.html">announced</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-to-ask-supreme-court-for-immediate-review-of-health-care-case.php">report</a>] that he will file a petition for <em>certiorari</em> before judgment with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>], asking the court to hear an appeal in the case of <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2171285&t=Commonwealth-of-Virginia-v.-Sebelius">Commonwealth v. Sebelius</a> [materials], the Commonwealth of Virginia's challenge to the health care reform law. Earlier this week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8DMNTD/$file/VinsonRuling1312011.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] the law as an unconstitutional overreaching of Congress' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell II backgrounder] power. The entire law was voided in that case, as the judge found the individual insurance mandate to be unserverable. That decision is expected to be appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Earlier in January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A committee of judicial and political leaders from the government and from opposition parties will suggest constitutional amendments. The <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website], the oldest and largest Islamic political group in the world, will be a part of the discussions despite currently being banned from Egypt. Cooperation in the constitutional review, the Brotherhood said, will only continue if the current regime continues to meet other demands. These demands include the removal of Egyptian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] and the removal of emergency laws that have been in place for more than thirty years.

<p>UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] on Friday called on Egyptian authorities to immediately <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-release-of-egypt-lawyers-journalists-activists.php">release lawyers, journalists and human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who have been arrested and for the government to investigate whether the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-egypt-protest-casualties.php">violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] has been planned. Pillay condemned Thursday's arrest of 20 activists and lawyers from the <a href="http://www.hmlc-egy.org/">Hisham Mubarak Law Centre</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] in Cairo. Staff members from the international rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/human-rights-activists-detained-egypt-must-be-freed-2011-02-04">among those detained</a> [AI press release] at the law center.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The execution of the two prison officials was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jXWRaGvzH010dNiqhLgElTIXTF6w?docId=1a49f1e08ca147cabaa87d99e4cf293c">reported</a> [AFP report] by Abdolhossein Rouhalamini, the father of one of the deceased protesters. The men were charged with torturing and eventually killing Mohammad Kamrani, Amir Javadi-far and Mohsen Ruholamini while they were detained at Kahrizak jail south of Iran. The two men were sentenced to death by hanging last June in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iran-court-begins-trial-of-prison.php">highly controversial trial</a> [JURIST report] that included nine other defendants. Observers had accused the Iranian government of conducting the trial as a mere political move. The Iranian government was also sharply criticized by both pro-democracy leaders and government supporters for the death of the protesters, who were incarcerated after the June 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">disputed presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Authorities initially claimed that the three detainees had died from meningitis, holding that the torture accusations were the propaganda of the opposition party. This viewpoint began to shift in August when <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iran-official-acknowledges-torture-of.php">government officials spoke out</a> [JURIST report] against the abuse of protesters detained in Iranian prisons and Supreme Leader <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [official website] ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison as a result.

<p>In August, Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi was named among three top judicial officials who were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/iran-prosecutor-reportedly-suspended-over-detainee-deaths.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the detainee deaths. The suspension will strip Mortazavi of his judicial immunity and clear the way for his prosecution. Last January, an Iranian <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-parliamentary-inquiry-finds.php">parliamentary inquiry found</a> [JURIST report] that Mortazavi was responsible for the deaths. The report alleged that Mortazavi, the prosecutor responsible for overseeing the Kahrizak prison, ordered that the prisoners be transferred to Kahrizak, where they were tortured and beaten to death. The US government and EU <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/eu-us-condemn-iran-human-rights.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] in February condemning the human rights violations following the presidential election. In December, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] the human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, STL Prosecutor Daniel Bellemare <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-lebanon-tribunal-hands-down-sealed-indictment-in-hariri-assassination-case.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/Press/prosectution/STL_Prosecutor_video_statement_transcript_en.pdf">sealed indictment</a> [statement, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/239">press release</a>] with the tribunal's pretrial judge charging an unknown number of people for their roles in Hariri's assassination. The names of those indicted will be <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=123808#axzz1BOW9WVLn">kept confidential</a> [Lebanon Daily Star report] until the pretrial judge reviews and approves the indictment, but many believe that the indictment names members of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder]. In August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. Last February, the head of the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/lebanon-tribunal-head-says-hariri-probe.php">reassured</a> [JURIST report] the Lebanese public that the investigation is on track. When asked about the progress of the investigation into the death of Hariri, the head of the STL "underlined the fact that the Tribunal already has in place all the legal and administrative instruments necessary for its work, and is fully operational so that justice may be dispensed with complete independence and impartiality in accordance with the highest international standards." The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive]. The call came as the rights groups announced that <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/FINAL%207%20Feb%20BUSH%20INDICTMENT.pdf">two criminal complaints</a> [text, PDF] were to be filed on Tuesday in Switzerland against Bush before he canceled his February 12 trip to the country. Swiss law requires the defendant to be in the country before an investigation can be opened. The complaint was to be accompanied by extensive <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/BUSH%20EXHIBIT%20LIST.pdf">supporting documents</a> [materials, PDF]. The groups claimed that Bush canceled his trip due to the impending indictment, an assertion that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/feb/06/george-bush-trip-to-switzerland">Bush has denied</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], and called on other signatory states to begin similar investigations against Bush. The groups urged that he is not entitled to any immunity as a former head of state under the CAT, and argued that Bush "bears individual and command responsibility for the acts of his subordinates which he ordered, authorized, condoned or otherwise aided and abetted, as well as for the violations committed by his subordinates which he failed to prevent or punish." The CCR explained that CAT signatories, which comprise 147 countries including the US, are obligated to pursue charges:<blockquote>While the US has thus far failed to comply with its obligations under the Convention Against Torture to prosecute and punish those who commit torture, all other signatories, too, are obligated to prosecute or extradite for prosecution anyone present in their territory they have a reasonable basis for believing has committed torture. If the evidence warrants, as the Bush Torture Indictment contends it does, and the US fails to request the extradition of Bush and others to face charges of torture there, CAT signatories must, under law, prosecute them for torture.</blockquote>The indictment cites Bush's recent memoir <u>Decision Points</u> as establishing his individual responsibility. In the book, Bush admits to the personal authorization of waterboarding and other so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques." Criminal investigations against Bush are ongoing in Germany, France and Spain under those countries' universal jurisdiction statutes.

<p>Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">rejected consistently by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] urged US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Bush for violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340---A000-.html">federal statute prohibiting torture</a> [18 USC &#167; 2340A]. Also citing his memoir, the ACLU argued that the use of waterboarding has historically been prosecuted as a crime in the US. The letter also argued that failure to investigate Bush would harm the US's ability to advocate for human rights in other countries. Bush's secretary of defense <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Donald+Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] has also faced possible criminal charges in Europe, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senior UK judge, Lord Leonard Hoffman, wrote the foreword, saying the "Strasbourg court has taken upon itself an extraordinary power to micromanage the legal systems of the member states," pointing specifically to a <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/british-prisoners-may-be-given-right.php">controversial ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the UK could not take away convicted prisoner's right to vote. The report, written by former government adviser Dr. Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, explains that the ECHR has gradually grown in power. It calls for the UK to try to negotiate reforms with the court to limit its jurisdiction, and, if unsuccessful, states "the UK should consider withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and establishing the Supreme Court in London as the final appellate court for human rights law." The UK currently incorporates the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] into its law, but the ECHR has the final interpretation. The report suggests that, if the UK pulls out, a domestic court would be final arbiter on human rights issues, and there would be no right to appeal to the ECHR. Still, some legal experts in the UK say that severing ties with the European court would <a href="http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12338931">harm its commitment</a> [BBC report] to protecting human rights and to the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> and the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">EU</a> [official websites].

<p>The ECHR and the UK have also clashed over the issue of extradition of terror suspects. Last month, the UK government's independent reviewer of terror laws <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-terrorism-expert-criticizes-European-court-rulings-on-control-orders.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that rulings from the ECHR made it difficult to remove foreign terror suspects from Britain. The ECHR refused to grant the government's request that a terror suspect be required to show that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to ill-treatment. The ruling lowered the suspect's burden of proving that he would be faced with ill-treatment upon returning to his home country. Last July, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">stayed the extradition of four terrorism suspects</a> [JURIST report] from the UK to the US, holding that potential punishment could violate Convention's provisions on the prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The replacement panel will now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12380167">hear the case</a> [BBC report] against Wilders, which stems from charges that he made inflammatory statements against Islam, calling the religion "fascist" and comparing the Koran to Hitler's book <u>Mein Kampf</u>. An independent appeals panel <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-dismisses-judges-for-bias-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">dismissed the original judges</a> [JURIST report] in October amidst allegations of bias against Wilders that his lawyer argued was illustrated by their refusal to allow the defense to recall a witness. Wilders' initial trial was scheduled to conclude in November, and he intends to call witnesses and present evidence that was barred during that trial. If convicted on the charges, he faces fines or a maximum sentence of one year in prison.

<p>Prior to their dismissal, the panel members heard the prosecution's case, which culminated in a request that Wilders be <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-prosecutor-requests-politicians-acquittal-for-anti-islamic-statements.php">acquitted on all charges</a> [JURIST report]. The prosecutors based their request on determinations that the politician's statements were directed at Islam and not Muslims themselves and additionally, that the evidence failed to establish that he intended to incite violence. The presentment of the prosecution's case followed an order from a panel of Dutch judges to resume the trial after <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-rejects-bias-allegations-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">rejecting claims of judicial bias</a> [JURIST report]. The trial had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-politicians-trial-suspended-soon-after-it-begins.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] after a lawyer representing Wilders accused one of the judges of making a statement which cast him in an unfavorable light to the jury. Prior to the start of his trial, Wilders <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the Dutch government would attempt to ban the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and other full Islamic veils to secure the support of Wilders' <a href="http://pvv.nl/">Freedom Party</a> [party website, in Dutch] in forming a coalition government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

After the official results were announced in the northern capital of Khartoum, Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>], who campaigned against secession, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?src=twrhp">issued a formal decree</a> [NYT report] accepting the result of the referendum. In an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/07/us-sudan-referendum-idUSTRE7161KV20110207?pageNumber=1">address</a> [Reuters report] on state television, al-Bashir said that he welcomed the results because they represent the will of the southern people. Experts had feared that the ruling <a href="http://www.ncpsudan.com/">National Congress Party</a> (NCP) [party website] of al-Bashir would try to stop the election because, depending on where the border is drawn, it could result in as much as 80 percent of the nation's oil reserves landing in the new southern state. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/sudan-referendum-voters-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-secession.php">preliminary results revealed</a> [JURIST report] an overwhelming majority of voters voted in favor of secession. With the South's secession from the North, the world's 193rd country will be announced on July 9 in Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan.

<p>In September, a human rights expert told the UN that Sudan was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-expert-tells-un-sudan-unprepared-for-january-self-determination-referendum.php">not prepared</a> [JURIST report] for the referendum. Mohamed Chande Othman, a Tanzanian judge and independent expert on the Sudan human rights situation, presented a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.CRP.1_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in Geneva warning that Sudan did not have the necessary infrastructure in place and cited major setbacks, including the suppression of free speech and of the press, restrictions on other civil and political rights, and inadequate protection of society due to a lack of well-trained police officers, prosecutors and judges. The report also stated that there are unresolved issues, including border demarcation, residency and voter eligibility, as well as the lack of a referendum commission in the contentious region of Abyei in southern Sudan. According to the 2005 <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8306.doc.htm">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) [UN report], the 10 states of Southern Sudan may form a new nation if voter turnout for the referendum exceeds 60 percent and 50 percent of voters approve of independence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement, marking the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Genital Mutilation and Cutting, encourages abandonment of the practice that has long-term health effects and is, according to the UN officials, a clear violation of girls' and women's fundamental human rights. The officials, UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, Anthony Lake, head a program formed by the two organizations that is designed to eliminate this practice. The goal of the program, started in 2008, is to encourage voluntary abandonment of practicing FGM and avoid condemnation of nations involved in that participate in this cultural practice. The officials said the joint program was making significant progress in many nations around the world:<blockquote>All girls deserve to grow up free from harmful practices that endanger their health and well-being. ... Governments, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders and community groups are making real progress. Three years into the programme, more than 6,000 communities in Ethiopia, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea and Somalia have already abandoned the practice. Social norms and cultural practices are changing, and communities are uniting to protect the rights of girls.</blockquote>To further promote the effort to preserve women's and girls' human rights, the program will be represented in an event, organized by the <a href="http://www.iac-ciaf.net/">Inter-African Committee</a> (IAC) [official website],  called "Building Bridges between Europe and Africa." The event will include representatives of governments in Africa, Europe and Latin America, several UN agencies, other international groups and women who have undergone FGM.

<p>As many as 140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of FGM, which is defined by the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website] as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons." Efforts in several countries, however, have sought to eliminate or reduce the practice. In 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">Uganda unanimously outlawed FGM</a> [JURIST report] and imposed harsh penalties anyone who conducts the procedure to face imprisonment. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php">called on the government of Iraqi Kurdistan</a> [JURIST report] to outlaw female genital mutilation and to develop a comprehensive legislative plan to reduce FGM in the region. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-secretary-orders.php">released from custody</a> [JURIST report] in August 2009 on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with terminal cancer and subsequently returned to his native Libya. Libyan officials began lobbying for Megrahi's release after his diagnosis in September 2008, stating that allowing Megrahi to die in Scottish custody would be the equivalent of a death sentence. The officials threatened "severe ramifications to UK interests" if Megrahi was not released. <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=david+cameron">news archive</a>] commissioned <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4096328.stm">Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell</a> [BBC profile] to review government documents and correspondence to determine the previous UK government's involvement in Megrahi's release. O'Donnell determined that there was no evidence the previous government "pressured or lobbied" the Scottish government to transfer or release Megrahi, but also stated that the previous government had an "underlying desire" of which the Scottish Government was aware to have Megrahi released.
<blockquote>Although it is likely that the Scottish Government was aware of this desire, there is no record that it was communicated or that UK interests played a part in Mr. Megrahi's release by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds. When the matter came to the then Prime Minister ... he did not seek to exercise any influence on the First Minister or the Scottish Government. Mr. Megrahi's release on cmpassionate grounds was a decision that Scottish Ministers alone could - and did - make.</blockquote>This "underlying desire" was fueled by a policy adopted after Megrahi's diagnosis "based upon an assessment that UK interests would be damaged if Mr. Megrahi were to die in a UK jail." The motivating factor was "normalizing relations" with Libya and avoiding harm "to UK nationals, to British interests and to cooperation on security issues." One British interest that weighed heavily on this policy was <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP">news archive</a>], which was engaged in contract negotiations to explore drilling in Libya and was suffering "significant financial loss" while these contracts remained unsigned. Doctors predicted Megrahi had only three months to live when released, but he is still living today in his native Libya.

<p>Last August, the Obama administration urged Libyan authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-administration-urges-return-to-prison-for-lockerbie-bomber.php">return Megrahi to a Scottish prison</a> [JURIST report] to serve the remainder of his sentence. Also in August, the opposition <a href="http://www.scottishlabour.org.uk/home">Scottish Labour Party</a> [party website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/scotland-lawmakers-call-for-release-of-lockerbie-bomber-medical-records.php">publication of all medical evidence</a> [JURIST report] related to Megrahi's release. In July, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-lawmakers-call-for-investigation-into-bp-involvement-in-release-of-lockerbie-bomber.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the role that BP may have played in Megrahi's release. Megrahi's release was controversial, with both <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-officials-criticize-lockerbie-bomber.php">US officials</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/scotland-parliament-votes-to-condemn.php">Scottish Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] condemning it. Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the Pan Am bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison, which he subsequently appealed. Libya <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/libya-makes-final-payment-to-terrorism.php">made its final compensation payment</a> [JURIST report] to a US fund for victims' families in November 2008 after agreeing to accept responsibility for the 1988 airline bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland that <a href="http://www.victimsofpanamflight103.org/">killed all 259 on board</a> [memorial website] including 180 Americans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ciavarella, a former judge in Pennsylvania's <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a>, is accused of receiving kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which they had a financial interest. Ciavarella is <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/02/07/Corruption-trial-for-Pa-judge-begins/UPI-75591297093481/">charged</a> [UPI report] with 39 counts of honest services fraud, racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud, bribery, extortion and tax evasion. Opening statements are scheduled to begin Tuesday.

<p>In July, Judge Edwin Kosik <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.wbcitizensvoice.com/pdfs/conplea.pdf">plea agreement</a> [text, PDF] with former Pennsylvania judge Michael Conahan for his involvement in the juvenile sentencing scandal. Conahan now faces a 20-year prison sentence, a fine of up to $250,000 and disbarment. Kosik had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and Ciavarella, finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed].

Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September of 2009, following a <a href="paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the guilty pleas they <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">entered</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

BOA is among more than two dozen US, Canadian and European lenders named as defendants in the class action lawsuit, which consolidated claims across the country in 2009. In their <a href="http://www.bank-overdraft.com/pdf/20091102-bofa-complaint.pdf">amended complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plaintiffs claimed that BOA's practices were deceptive in that they did not reasonably notify customers that they had the option of opting out of the overdraft scheme and declining transactions. The complaint also alleged that BOA's excessive fees disproportionately effect low-income customers. A judge must now approve the settlement agreement.

<p>BOA has recently been the target of several lawsuits. In January, plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/investors-sue-bank-of-america-subsidiary-for-fraud.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/countrywide_financial_corporation/index.html">Countrywide Financial Corporation</a> [NYT backgrounder], a BOA subsidiary, in <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/supctmanh/">New York State Supreme Court</a> [official website] alleging widespread fraud that resulted in substantial financial losses.

The judge <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/Politics/Italy-Tunisian-terror-convict-kept-at-Guantanamo-in-inhumane-conditions-freed_311649774802.html">handed Mabrouk a two-year suspended sentence</a> [AKI report] for terrorist association based on recommendations from Mabrouk's lawyer and prosecutor Armando Spataro. The fact that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is illegal under Italian law played a role in the prosecution's agreement to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jz4zJK7F7vfuE37ZMCiIlJszEWbQ?docId=5879028">seek a lenient sentence</a> [CP report]. The US government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">transferred Mabrouk</a> [JURIST report] from Guantanamo Bay to Italy in 2009 along with fellow Tunisian <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/510-mohamed-ben-riadh-nasri">Mohamed Ben Riadh Nasri</a> [NYT materials], whom an Italian court <a href="/2011/02/italy-court-convicts-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">sentenced to six years in prison</a> [JURIST report] last week, as part of the US government's attempt to shut down the detention center. It is unclear where Mabrouk will go after being released, especially given the political situation in his home country.

<p>The continued operation of Guantanamo Bay remains controversial. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized US President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility. Obama's stated desire to close Guantanamo has faced heavy opposition in Congress. In early January, Obama signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the US for trial. The legislation authorized funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs and barred the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and limited funds available for transfers to foreign countries. The administration plans to seek the repeal of these restrictions and opposes the extension or expansion of them in the future. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].

UN prosecutors said the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/8311185/Charles-Taylor-fails-to-return-to-war-crimes-tribunal-after-lawyer-row.html">trial will proceed</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] despite Taylor and his lawyer, Courtenay Griffiths, leaving the courtroom at the beginning of the prosecution's closing arguments. Griffiths <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12395445">called the tribunal a "farce"</a> [BBC report] after it refused to accept the defense's written brief because it was 20 days past the deadline. He addressed the court saying, "[o]ur very presence in court is incompatible with our duty to protect Mr. Taylor's interest. And it is our intention ... to leave court at this point." Griffiths argues that the court will not have the foundational information from his brief, but asserts that they are not withdrawing entirely from the court. They only want to wait for an appeals court to decide whether the court should accept the brief before reaching a verdict. 

<p>Taylor's <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">charges</a> [indictment, PDF], including murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism, stem from from a "campaign to terrorize the civilian population" of Sierra Leone. Taylor's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">opened their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 and have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia. His trial continued after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-denies.php">denied his motion for acquittal</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. Prosecutors previously expressed concern that the defense's list of 256 witnesses could make the trial last up to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-warns-taylor-trial-at.php">four additional years</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf's name was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12384840">included on an interim criminal charge-sheet</a> [BBC report] after investigations revealed that he appointed and allegedly gave orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto on the day she was assassinated. Specifically, the prosecution document alleges that Musharraf ordered the officers to remove a security detail for Bhutto prior to her departure and that he later ordered the same officers to hose down the scene of the assassination. In December, a Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/pakistan-court-orders-police-arrested-in-bhutto-assassination-investigation.php">issued warrants</a> [JURIST report] for the arrest of Syed Saud Aziz and Khurram Shahzad, the two accused of carrying out Musharraf's orders. Information gathered during questioning of these officers influenced the decision to include Musharraf's name on the charge-sheet, which does not act as a formal indictment. 

<p>In January, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">assassinated</a> [JURIST report] by one of his own security guards, apparently due to his opposition to Pakistan's <a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net/Shaikh/blasphemy_laws_in_pakistan.htm">blasphemy law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+blasphemy">news archive</a>]. Taseer, a senior member of the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a> (PPP) [official website], was shot while getting into his car at Islamabad's Kohsar Market and died later at a hospital. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the guard immediately surrendered to police and confessed to shooting Taseer because he had spoken against the blasphemy law. This was the most high-profile assassination since that of Bhutto in 2007 and again involved issues of security. The Pakistani government and police forces have been criticized for their part in Bhutto's assassination. In April 2010, an independent UN commission formed to investigate the assassination, issued a report <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-commission-report-blames-pakistan.php">holding the Pakistani government and police forces responsible</a> [JURIST report] for failing to provide adequate security. The report also accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into the assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, "Broken Bodies, Tortured Minds: Abuse and Neglect of Detainees in Iraq," alleges that Iraqi and US forces have detained tens of thousands of people without trials, access to lawyers or opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=central+criminal+court+of+iraq">Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a> (CCCI) [JURIST news archive], according to the report, regularly convicts defendants based on confessions extracted with the use of torture and ill-treatment. AI claims that, upon release, prisoners often leave the detention centers with serious physiological and psychological injury:<blockquote>After US forces handed over tens of thousands of prisoners to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and July 2010 without any guarantees that they will be protected, there is every likelihood that torture and ill-treatment will remain widespread. Such abuses have a devastating impact on the victims not just when they are being tortured or ill-treated, but often for years afterwards or even for the rest of their lives. Urgent action is needed to end the pattern of abuse and to help the victims and their families.</blockquote>Overcrowding and lack of medical treatment also contribute to the poor conditions enumerated in the report. Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110206-318693/Iraqi-PM-we-have-no-secret-prisons">denied similar claims</a> [AFP report] made by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] earlier this week.

<p>Numerous human rights groups have responded to reports of detainee torture in Iraq. In September, AI published a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE14/006/2010/en/c7df062b-5d4c-4820-9f14-a4977f863666/mde140062010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] alleging that the Iraqi government is <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/thousands-iraqi-detainees-risk-torture-after-us-handover-2010-09-13">unlawfully detaining and torturing</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iraq-unlawfully-holding-torturing-thousands-of-detainees-report.php">report</a>] thousands of detainees. In June, UN Special Representative to Iraq Ad Melkert <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-advises-iraq-to-ratify-convention-against-torture.php">urged the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. Melkert stated that Iraq had made several advances in recognizing human rights violations, but the government's policy implementation still faces several obstacles. The convention was adopted by the UN in 1984 and has been ratified by 147 countries. Iraq remains one of 45 member-countries that have yet to ratify the treaty. In April, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">reported on the repeated torture</a> [JURIST report] of Iraqi detainees in a secret prison in Baghdad. HRW reported that detainees held at the secret Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law, which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers, and online news sites, has been criticized as being too restrictive of freedom of expression. Last month, European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/11/6&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">challenged the legality of the act</a> [statement, text] under EU law, specifically provisions that apply to media originating in countries other than Hungary, regulate media beyond simple broadcasting and require media outlets to register with a new authority. Hungary's Communication Minister Zoltan Kovacs said that officials will address the problems noted by the European Commission and change the text to make the media law more clear and precise. The Hungarian government plans to revise the text and <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14824823,00.html">submit changes</a> [DW report] to the law on Thursday. 

<p>Hungary's parliament passed the new media law last December amid protests and criticism. The law took effect on January 1, 2011, the same day the Hungarian government assumed the presidency of the EU. Despite criticism, the Hungarian government initially <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-defends-controversial-media-law-in-face-of-eu-criticism.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the law, which created the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media and Communications Authority </a>(NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian]. Under the new law, the NMHH can fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority, whose members are all loyal to the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Fidesz party</a> [party website, in Hungarian]. The law has been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1344032/Front-page-protests-Hungary-media-law-threatens-fines-unbalanced-coverage.html">harshly criticized</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] by members of the media, as well as other European governments, as being too restrictive of free expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Syria appears to be lifting the ban imposed in 2007 as a <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=2&articleId=73460">concession to avoid popular upheaval</a> [DP report] in Syria. Because both Facebook and YouTube are routinely accessed by Syrians through international proxy servers, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/08/AR2011020803022.html">concession may have limited impact</a> [AP report]. The move follows a recent interview in which President Bashar Al-Assad indicated he would push for political reforms including <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/08/syria-facebook-unbanned-people">municipal elections and a new media law</a> [CP report]. Other websites, such as Amazon and Wikipedia, remain blocked for the time being.

<p>Several countries have banned and unbanned popular media sites in recent years. In November, Turkish authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/turkish-government-lifts-youtube-ban.php">lifted a nearly three-year ban</a> [JURIST report] on YouTube after disputed videos that allegedly insulted Turkey's founder, <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [Turkish News profile], were removed from the site's content. In July, a Russian court made public a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-bans-youtube-for-extremist-content.php">banning access to five websites</a> [JURIST report], including YouTube, for extremist elements. In June, a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/pakistan-court-reimposes-ban-on-youtube-for-offensive-content.php">reimposed a ban on YouTube</a> [JURIST report] after content deemed offensive to Muslims resurfaced on the website when a previous ban was lifted last month. In May, the <a href="http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php?cur_t=vnormal">Pakistan Telecommunications Authority</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/pakistan-government-blocks-facebook-over-mohammed-drawing-competition.php">ordered Internet service providers to block Facebook</a> [JURIST report] in response to a competition created by a group of the website's members entitled "Draw Muhammad Day."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote was <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll026.xml">277 to 148</a> [roll call], falling short of the two-thirds majority required for the "suspension of the rules" procedure. The provisions in question, set to expire on February 28, create the authority for roving surveillance, including wire-taps and cell phone monitoring; compel production of business records and "other tangible things" under section 215 of the Act; and allow the US to target non-US persons "who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist group," under the "lone wolf" amendment, section 6001. Earlier this month, the Obama administration released a <a href = "http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">Statement of Administration Policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the features, but expressed support for the now-failed House bill. A major opponent of the bill, the <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], was <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/national-security/house-blocks-extension-overbroad-patriot-act-provisions">pleased with the vote</a> [press release], with Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office stating:<blockquote>The House should be commended for refusing to rubberstamp the continuation of these provisions. For the nearly 10 years it has been law, the over-reaching Patriot Act has been abused by law enforcement to violate innocent Americans' privacy. We urge both the House and the Senate to keep up this momentum and continue to fight the extension of these provisions that put Americans' privacy at risk.</blockquote>Republican lawmakers are expected to bring the bill up again for a vote by simple majority before the provisions expire.

<p>In September 2009, the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> the Patriot Act, which it <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">did in February 2010</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-rejects-patriot-act.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the Patriot Act in December 2009 due to lack of standing. The <a href = "http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> [official website] had previously ruled that <a href = "/paperchase/2007/09/federal-judge-rules-patriot-act.php">certain provisions of the act were unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The Patriot Act was passed in 2001, on the heels of the 9/11 attacks, greatly expanding US law enforcement's powers of surveillance and discretion when conducting terrorism investigations, and the US Government's ability to regulate foreign individuals' and immigrants' financial transactions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Phillips explained that unexpectedly low contributions from civil courts coupled with the economic crisis had forced the Supreme Court to turn to the Lord Chancellor, a member of parliament, for funding. One method of funding discussed and ultimately dismissed before the court <a href="/2009/10/uk-supreme-court-hears-inaugural-case.php">opened in 2009</a> [JURIST report] was submission of a budget directly to the treasury. Phillips endorsed this approach. He told the audience:<blockquote>My conclusion is that our present funding arrangements do not satisfactorily guarantee our institutional independence. We are, in reality, dependent each year upon what we can persuade the Ministry of Justice of England and Wales to give us by way of "contribution". This is not a satisfactory situation for the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. It is already leading to a tendency on the part of the Ministry of Justice to try to gain the Supreme Court as an outlying part of its empire.</blockquote>Phillips also said he was concerned by comments from members of parliament criticizing judicial review of parliamentary and executive actions. <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/clarke.htm">Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Kenneth Clarke</a> [official profile] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9391000/9391865.stm">dismissed Phillips' concerns</a> [BBC report, audio] saying that the Supreme Court is fully independent in judicial matters, but does not have the right to determine its own budget. Phillips "can order me through his court to do whatever he likes, to obey the law," Clarke said, " [but] he can';t tell me how much he wants to spend and be free of the [budget] cuts. In that respect I'm afraid inevitably he's going to be subject to the same public expenditure negotiations as everybody else."

<p>The Supreme Court was created to emphasize the split between the judicial and legislative branches of government. The court has said that "it will transform the public's awareness of justice at the highest level" and a "fundamental aim is to be as transparent as possible." The court is the first in the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-justice-minister-favors-televising.php">record proceedings</a> [JURIST report] and make them available to the media. In most cases, the court stands as the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Additionally, the justices of the Supreme Court are no longer able to sit or vote with the House of Lords as they had done in their capacity as Law Lords. The Law Lords <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-law-lords-order-clarification-of.php">issued their final ruling</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, public gatherings in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, West Bank and Yemen have encountered force from security officials. In Ramallah, Palestine peaceful demonstrators were punched and kicked by the "special forces." Two journalists, a HRW research assistant and organizers of the demonstrations in Ramallah have been detained.  In Syria, police forces stood by as 20 people in civilian clothing beat demonstrators that had assembled to hold a candlelight vigil for Egyptian demonstrators. On February 4, police detained Ghassan al-Najjar, the leader of the Islamic Democratic Current, after he issued calls for Syrians to demonstrate for more freedom in their country. In Saudi Arabia, citizens canceled their plans for a peaceful sit-in to urge reform and better jobs after they were summoned by Interior Ministry officials. Sudanese authorities have also targeted journalists and censored newspapers covering protests. On February 2, more than a dozen of the staff of al-Maidan, a communist newspaper, were arrested. HRW also reports of an unconfirmed death of a student, Mohammed Abderahman, who was part of a protest in late January which was suppressed by excessive force. In Yemen, 6 people were injured and 28 arrested, including journalists and human rights activists, according to the <a href="http://www.yohr.org/">Yemeni Observatory of Human Rights</a> [official website; in Arabic]. In Bahrain, the government shut down a Facebook page calling for protests. 

<p>The violent response to the protests comes at a time of uncertainty in the region. Demonstrations against the 30-year reign of Egyptian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/over-1000-detained-in-egypt-amid-widespread-protests.php">began last week</a> [JURIST report] and have become more violent since Mubarak announced Tuesday that although he will <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112221313603381.html">not seek re-election</a> [transcript, text], he does not plan on stepping down nor leaving Egypt. Some reports allege as many as <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110203/162441336.html">300 deaths and 1,500 injuries</a> [Ria Novosti report] as a result of the protests. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Egyptian opposition leader <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-bio.html">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> [Nobel Prize profile] last week expressed his <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12300164">willingness to lead a transitional government</a> [BBC report]. He has returned to Egypt and is reported to have joined the protests. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is closely related to the <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">recent civil unrest in Tunisia</a> [JURIST op-ed] that culminated last month with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Suleiman announced Egypt's timetable for a peaceful transition of power and discussions that have taken place with opposition party representatives. The various participants involved in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/06/AR2011020601767.html?hpid=topnews">discussions with Suleiman</a> [WP text of statement] expressed their "appreciation and respect" for the movement that took place beginning on January 25. Discussion participants expressed the need to address the lack of security in Egypt, disturbances and obstruction of public services, the suspension of education, delays in delivery of essential goods, losses of the Egyptian economy and attempts of foreign entities to intervene in Egyptian affairs. Suleiman indicated that a committee of judicial and political leaders from the government and from opposition parties will suggest constitutional and legislative amendments to address the current state of affairs in Egypt. The proposal period is expected to be completed by early March.

<p>Egypt's government has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/joint-egypt-panel-to-study-constitutional-reform.php">reached out</a> [JURIST report] to various opposition leaders since demonstrations erupted in the country, including the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood </a>[official website], the oldest and largest Islamic political group in the world and currently banned from Egypt. Cooperation in the constitutional review, the Brotherhood said, will only continue if the current regime continues to meet other demands. These demands include the removal of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the repeal of emergency laws that have been in place for more than thirty years. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Friday called on Egyptian authorities to immediately <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-release-of-egypt-lawyers-journalists-activists.php">release lawyers, journalists and human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who have been arrested and for the government to investigate whether the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-egypt-protest-casualties.php">violence against protesters </a>[JURIST report] has been planned. Pillay condemned the arrest last Thursday of <a href="http://www.hmlc-egy.org/node/1656">20 activists and lawyers</a> [HMLC news release] from the <a href="http://www.hmlc-egy.org/">Hisham Mubarak Law Centre</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] in Cairo. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-bc-il--baldknobcross,0,1319272.story">rejected</a> [AP report] an argument that the $20,000 grant constituted a legislative earmark, thereby violating the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] by directing state funds to support religion.  Judge Michael McCuskey held that the <a href="http://www.commerce.state.il.us/dceo/">Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity</a> [official website] may allocate its funds as it sees fit, and that the grant in question represents permissible discretionary spending by the executive branch.  The challenge was initially brought in August by Rob Sherman, who has indicated on his <a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/2011/02/09.htm">website</a> [advocacy website] that he intends to appeal the "bizarre" decision to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>In October, the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-illinois-school-moment-of-silence-law.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Sherman's challenge to the constitutionality of an Illinois statute that mandated a daily moment of silence in public schools.  The court reversed an April 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-illinois-school.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=9&SessionID=51&GA=95&DocTypeID=SB&DocNum=1463&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session">Illinois Reflection and Silent Prayer Act</a> [text] is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion in public schools. The appellate court instead found that the statute had a secular legislative purpose that neither advanced nor inhibited religion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Cuccinelli <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/020311_HealthCare_Expedited.html">announced last week</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-to-ask-supreme-court-for-immediate-review-of-health-care-case.php">report</a>] that he was going to petition the court for an expedited review due to the far-reaching public policy implications inherent in the implementation of the legislation and the potential cost to the states as uncertainty surrounding the legislation's constitutionality remains. In December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/12/13/va.healthcare.ruling.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] the individual mandate portion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), but left the remainder of the bill intact. Cuccinelli is asking the court to rule on whether the lower court erred when it found that the individual mandate was a violation of Congress' powers under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the Constitution and whether it erred in determining that the individual mandate provision of the law was severable from the remainder of the act, leaving the majority of the provision of the PPACA in place. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] has indicated that they believe the challenge <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020903000.html">should be heard by the court of appeals</a> [AP report] before being considered by the Supreme Court. The court of appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2171285&t=Commonwealth-of-Virginia-v.-Sebelius">Commonwealth v. Sebelius</a> [materials] in May. 

<p>There are currently cases in 28 states challenging the provisions of the PPACA and the lower court rulings on issues surrounding the legislation have been mixed. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Mississippi <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/assets/pdf/DB16992723.PDF">dismissed a lawsuit challenging the law</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">report</a>] on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing because their allegations were insufficient to show "certainly impending" injury. In January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8DMNTD/$file/VinsonRuling1312011.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] the law as an unconstitutional overreaching of Congress' Commerce Clause power. The entire law was voided in that case, as the judge found the individual insurance mandate to be unserverable. That decision is expected to be appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Earlier in January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Momic, who has allegedly been living under a false name in France, was arrested last week in Grenoble under an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/france-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-massacre-suspect.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report]. An alleged former member of the Serbian paramilitary group known as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scorpions">Scorpions</a> [JURIST news archive], Momic is <a href="http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/croatia-seeks-extradition-of-war-crimes-suspect-from-france_128798.html">charged</a> [AFP report] in a Vukovar court for the murder of one Croat citizen and the physical intimidation of others. A spokesman for the court claims that Momic was a citizen of Croatia in September 1991, when the crimes were committed in the village of Berak, near Vukovar. In addition to Croatia, Momic's native Serbia also seeks his extradition to try him for crimes against humanity. Serbian officials suspect Momic participated in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] in Bosnia, where a total of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed. Serbian prosecutors believe that Momic is part of a Scorpion group that <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/srebrenica-video-from-milosevic-trial.php">videotaped the murder</a> [JURIST report] of Bosnian Muslims near Srebrenica. The <a href="/monitor/2005/06/srebrenica-killings-video-icty.php">graphic 1995 video</a> [JURIST video; WARNING: this video may be disturbing to some viewers] first surfaced in 2005 during the <a href="/hottopics/milosevic.php">trial of Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] by the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website].

<p>Serbia has undertaken an ongoing effort to apprehend those responsible for the atrocities that occurred in the region during the 1992-95 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Suspected Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) war criminal Dragan Crnogorac was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November in connection with the Srebrenica massacre.

On Thursday morning, security forces reportedly took control of the area outside of Karroubi's residence and have barred all family members, except his wife, from entering. The report indicates that the arrest is related to calls by Karroubi and fellow opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8103851.stm">Mir-Hossein Mousavi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mir-Hossein+Mousavi">news archives</a>] for rallies in support of the recent political reform movements in <a href="http://www.cfr.org/egypt/ripple-effect-egypts-protests/p24007?cid=rss-middleeast-ripple_effect_of_egypt_s_prote-020411">Tunisia and Egypt</a> [CFR backgrounder]. Karroubi and Mousavi <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/day_of_rage_blog/2299873.html">sought permission</a> [RFE/RL report] from the government to hold such a rally on Monday, but State Prosecutor Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110210/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_opposition">rejected the request</a> [AP report] and warned that there would be serious consequences if the rally went ahead unsanctioned. In lieu of attending the opposition rally, Iran's government is encouraging citizens to <a href="http://isna.ir/isna/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1711851&Lang=P">attend a government-sanctioned rally</a> [ISNA report, in Persian] on February 11 to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.

<p>Last month, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he would prosecute opposition leaders for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Dolatabadi <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/02iran.html?_r=1">threatened to prosecute</a> [NYT report] Mousavi and Karroubi and former Iranian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3027382.stm">Mohammad Khatami</a> [BBC profile]. Mousavi and the other leaders called for continuing protests [JURIST report] to oppose the results of the 2009 presidential election, arguing that it was fraudulent. The three leaders would join a long line of individuals detained or already prosecuted for their roles during the election protests. In September, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist arrested after the 2009 elections, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iran-court-sentences-journalist-charged-with-warring-against-god-to-six-years.php">sentenced to six years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for charges including "warring against God" and distributing anti-government propaganda. Also in September, Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent Iranian human rights lawyer known for representing political activists following the 2009 election, was detained for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-detained.php">spreading propaganda and colluding against national security</a> [JURIST report]. In August, an Iranian court sentenced Qorban Behzadianejad, Mousavi's campaign manager, to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/aid-to-iran-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-report.php">five years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. The Iranian government detained hundreds of protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">sentenced several to death</a> [JURIST report].

His sentence reduced to just two years, al Qosi could return to his native Sudan as soon as summer of 2012, and he will serve the balance of his sentence in a minimum-security Guantanamo Bay facility until then. Unbeknownst to the 10-officer jury that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-jury-recommends-14-year-sentence-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">sentenced him to 14 years</a> last August, al Qosi had <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/guantanamo-detainee-agrees-to-plea-deal-at-military-tribunal.php">struck a secret plea deal</a> [JURIST reports] with Pentagon officials that will remain sealed until his eventual release. Under the terms of the deal, the Convening Authority for Military Commissions (CAMC), which has final review authority over military tribunal sentences, agreed to cut al Qosi's jury sentence to the extent that it exceeded the bargained-for term. Senior CAMC overseer <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] had the authority to reduce al Qosi's sentence further, but adhered to the two-year maximum term in the plea agreement. </p>

<p>Al Qosi, one of the first to be detained at Guantanamo Bay in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=war+on+terror">war on terror</a> [JURIST news archive], has been in US custody for nine years. His July sentencing marked the fourth time a Guantanamo detainee had been convicted by a military tribunal since the detention center opened in 2002 and the first time a captive had been convicted since the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">ordered the facility shut down</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. In December 2009, a military judge ruled that the US government could <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/military-judge-denies-admission-of-new.php">partially amend the charges</a> [JURIST report] against al Qosi by changing his jurisdictional basis but could not include four additional years of alleged activities under the charges. In October 2009,<a href="/paperchase/2009/10/military-judges-grant-continuances-in.php"> military judges granted continuances</a> [JURIST report] for prosecutors in the case against al Qosi. At the time, it was expected that the continuances would make way for a decision on whether to hold the remaining Guantanamo detainee proceedings in civilian or military court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW, in conjunction with <a href = "http://egyprotest-defense.blogspot.com/">Front for the Defense of Egyptian Protesters</a> (FDP) [advocacy website, in Arabic], has calculated at least 119 arbitrary detentions and five incidents of torture, providing <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/02/08/egypt-statements-protesters-detained-army">detainee accounts</a> [text]. The organizations contend that the military is targeting human rights activists, protesters and journalists:<blockquote>Military police arrested at least 37 human rights defenders and activists since January 31 and held them from periods ranging from 12 to 48 hours. On the afternoon of February 3, military police, accompanied by a uniformed policeman and plainclothes security officers, raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center (HMLC), a human rights organization, and arrested 28 Egyptian and international human rights researchers, lawyers, and journalists.

On January 29, the military took over policing duties from the <A href = "http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website], whose forces were also accused of arbitrary arrests and abuse.

The court affirmed the constitutionality of a provision that vests the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court</a> [official website] with, and removes from trial judges, the authority to determine the national security implications of evidence that prosecutors seek to withhold. In reaching its conclusion, the court noted the balance that must be struck between ensuring security and a fair judicial system:<blockquote>As we have stated, co-operative arrangements between the prosecution and the defence are to be encouraged, as they have the potential to greatly facilitate complex trials for all parties involved and to reduce the strain on judicial resources. However, the defence is under no obligation to cooperate with the prosecution and if the end result of non-disclosure by the Crown is that a fair trial cannot be had, then Parliament has determined that in the circumstances a stay of proceedings is the lesser evil compared with the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information.</blockquote>The case stems from the prosecutions of the <a href="http://www3.thestar.com/static/toronto18/index.html">"Toronto 18"</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Toronto+18">news archive</a>], who were arrested in 2006 after police learned of their plans to bomb sites throughout Ontario using fertilizer explosives in response to Canada's military involvement in Afghanistan.

<p>The final two members of the Toronto 18 were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-court-convicts-remaining-toronto-18-terrorism-suspects.php">convicted</a> in June, a month after accused group leader Fahim Ahmad <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/accused-toronto-18-leader-pleads-guilty-mid-trial.php">switched his plea to guilty mid-trial</a> [JURIST reports].  Last February, Toronto 18 member Shareef Abdelhaleem was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-judge-convicts-toronto-18-member.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] after a Canadian judge found no evidence of entrapment. In January 2010, Amin Mohamed Durrani was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/toronto-18-member-released-after.php">released</a> [JURIST report] after pleading guilty to participating in and assisting a terrorist group. Also in January, Zakaria Amara and <a href="/forumy/2008/04/toronto-18-terrorism-case-no-trial-by.php">Saad Gaya</a> [JURIST op-ed] were <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-toronto-18.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to life and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in the plot.

Voting to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hYVIv1cm3uZ0vmPDL5H7d5Odb73w?docId=N0671471297361503992A">extend the ban</a> [UKPA report] by an overwhelming 212-vote majority, MPs have now forced British <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website], who supports the ban, to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704629004576136481974753902.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">decide whether to ignore</a> [WSJ report] the ECHR's ruling or <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8317387/MPs-vote-against-giving-prisoners-the-right-to-vote.html">risk lawsuits</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] by prisoners over their lost rights. Some lawmakers have suggested meeting the minimum standards required by international law by restricting the right to vote to inmates serving sentences of less than four years, while others have demanded that the UK withdraw from ECHR membership entirely. The UK currently incorporates the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] into its law, but the ECHR has the final interpretation.

<p>Earlier this week, UK think tank <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/">Policy Exchange</a> [think tank website] <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/PX_Keeping_Human_Rights_at_Home_WEB_07_02_11.pdf">called</a> [text, PDF] for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-urged-to-withdraw-from-europe-rights-court.php">UK to withdraw from the ECHR</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a domestic high court. The report, written by former government adviser Dr. Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, explains that the ECHR has gradually grown in power. It calls for the UK to try to negotiate reforms with the court to limit its jurisdiction, and, if unsuccessful, states "the UK should consider withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and establishing the Supreme Court in London as the final appellate court for human rights law." Some legal experts in the UK say that severing ties with the European court would <a href="http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12338931">harm its commitment</a> [BBC report] to protecting human rights and to the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> and the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">EU</a> [official websites]. The controversy over UK prisoner voting rights stems from a 2005 case filed by John Hirst, who had been sentenced to life in prison for killing his landlord. Hirst claimed he should be able to vote while in prison and the ECHR agreed, <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=28&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=66362626&skin=hudoc-pr-en">ruling</a> [judgment; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=29&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=66362626&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/schedule2/ccrorder45.htm">Representation of the People Act of 1983</a> [text] breached Hirst's human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The counterclaim contains five counts accusing the federal government of violating the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ367/pdf/PLAW-109publ367.pdf">Secure Fence Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF] by losing control of the border with Mexico, violating <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Article 4</a> [text] of the US Constitution by failing to protect Arizona from an "invasion" of illegal immigrants, failing to enforce federal immigration law <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/usc_sec_08_00001373----000-.html">8 USC &#167;1373</a> [text] requiring the government to respond to state inquiries about individuals' immigration status, refusing to reimburse the state costs of battling illegal immigration under the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ojp.usdoj.gov%2FBJA%2Fgrant%2F2006_SCAAP_Guidelines.pdf&rct=j&q=State%20Criminal%20Alien%20Assistance%20Program%2C&ei=NGVVTa3TJcvngQet-6yNDQ&usg=AFQjCNE6ErBn5hd2S1WLcI0dC3P0vyrNGA&sig2=ojnD8cFGvdWN1zZXwWigUg&cad=rja">State Criminal Alien Assistance Program</a> [text, PDF] and violating the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text] of the Constitution by infringing on state rights. Brewer said that the state has been <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2011/02/11/20110211arizona-to-sue-federal-government-over-border-security.html">collecting private donations</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] to help fund the lawsuit. 

<p>In October, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] motions to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the immigration law. The class action joined two other lawsuits <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] earlier last year that also challenged the law. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Brewer seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Three of the seven suspects are only 15 years old and will not face the death penalty because of their age.

<p>Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is an ongoing international concern, and several countries have started taking legal action against suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia+pirates">Somali pirates</a> [JURIST news archive].

The trial in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] is the first US piracy trial in more than 100 years.

The SCSL will allow Taylor to appeal a ruling that denied the admission of a defense document due to untimely filing. Friday's <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/02/11/general-eu-war-crimes-taylor_8303705.html">court ruling</a> [AP report] comes following a boycott by Taylor and his lawyers of this week's <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/closing-arguments-begin-in-trial-of-former-liberian-president-taylor-enters.php">closing arguments</a> [JURIST report] in protest of the court's decision to refuse to accept a written defense brief that was filed 20 days late. Taylor's lawyer, Courtenay Griffiths, said that he viewed the court's decision optimistically and expressed hope that the court's decision to hear the appeal is an indication that the remainder of the trial will be <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/sierraLeoneNews/idAFLDE71A1MX20110211?sp=true">conducted in a reasonable manner</a> [Reuters report]. Griffith also stated that the disputed document was not filed in a timely manner because the defense was waiting on the court to rule on eight legal matters before they could complete their brief. Taylor's trial, which has lasted nearly three years, will resume after the appeals chamber decides whether to accept the defense document.

<p>Taylor is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied all allegations</a> [JURIST report] against him.  Charges <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">include</a> [indictment, PDF] murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism, all stemming from from a "campaign to terrorize the civilian population" of Sierra Leone. Taylor's defense lawyers, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">began presenting their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009, have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia. His trial continued after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-denies.php">denied his motion for acquittal</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. Prosecutors previously expressed concern that the defense's list of 256 witnesses could make the trial last up to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-warns-taylor-trial-at.php">four additional years</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The council also promised not to prosecute "honourable people who refused corruption and demanded for reform."

Chen, who is blind, is currently under house arrest, and the beating may have been <a href="http://chrdnet.org/2011/02/11/chinese-government-must-end-persecution-of-family-members-of-activists/">related to a video released</a> [CHRD press release] on Wednesday by China Aid in which Chen talks about the frustrating circumstances surrounding his confinement. In the video, Chen described the condition of confinement, including 24-hour surveillance, cut phone lines and the <a href="http://www.chinaaid.org/2011/02/china-blind-activist-beaten-senseless.html">inability to receive medical attention</a> [China Aid press release].

In January 2007, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/china-court-upholds-sentence-of-rights.php">rejected</a> Chen's final appeal after a Chinese intermediate appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/china-appeals-court-orders-retrial-of.php">ordered a retrial</a> [JURIST reports] in November 2006.

The panel's final report indicates at least <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jK3IgJl6rYAjWWgxJkbp_wkJmAsQ?docId=CNG.680158c3fc877f3521627185c89de338.be1">two activists were killed before commandos boarded</a> [AFP report] the Mavi Marmara, the largest ship in the flotilla. According to the report, an additional <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkey-to-release-its-flotilla-raid-report-2011-02-11">five persons were shot in the head from close range</a> [<em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> report], including an injured Turkish-American who was shot execution-style in the back of the head. The Turkish report concludes that Israeli soldiers used <a href="http://www.startribune.com/world/115907179.html">excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate force on unarmed civilians</a> [AP report] as part of a full-fledged and well-planned attack. The report reasons that, because Israel's naval blockade is illegal, any action related to the blockade is likewise illegal, including the raid on the flotilla. 

<p>The findings directly contradict those of Israel's <a href="http://www.turkel-committee.gov.il">Turkel Commission</a> [official website]. Last month, the Turkel Commission, a civilian committee assigned to investigate the May 31 flotilla raid, concluded that Israel did <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/commission-concludes-israel-did-not-violate-international-law-in-flotilla-raid.php">not violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. In September, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] released a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-report-finds-israel-flotilla-raid-violated-international-law.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] Israel's interception of the Gaza-bound flotilla as a violation of international law.

In July, an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">Israeli military probe</a> [JURIST report] found insufficient intelligence and planning in the May 31 raid on the Gaza-bound flotilla, but also concluded that no punishments were necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Aamer has been held by the US since 2002 on claims that he was fighting with the Taliban. This weekend marks the ninth full year of his detainment, and the US is yet to charge him with any crime. Aamer is the last UK resident being held at Guantanamo, and he is the center of a high-profile <a href="http://action.amnesty.org.uk/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=1194&ea.campaign.id=9032">Amnesty campaign</a> [campaign website] pushing for him to receive a fair trial or to be released so he may return to his family in the UK. Commenting on Aamer's incarceration AI UK Director Kate Allen stated: 
<blockquote>The treatment meted out to Shaker Aamer has made a total mockery of justice. It&#8217;s been nine years without charges, without a trial and, in many ways, without much hope for Shaker, and we are determined to see his basic human rights restored. Now there could be light at the end of the tunnel for Shaker. Thousands of people on both sides of the Atlantic have recently called on senior UK and US politicians to break the deadlock over his case...Given the time involved, the lengthy spells in solitary confinement and the torture allegedly used against him, Shaker Aamer&#8217;s plight has been one of the worst of all the detainees held at Guantanamo. There are strong humanitarian and human rights grounds for the UK government to step up its efforts to secure a fair trial or a safe release for Shaker.</blockquote> Aamer is originally from Saudi Arabia, but is married to a British citizen, and has four British children. He had been given permission to live in the UK indefinitely when he was arrested in 2001. 

<p>In November AI <a href="paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-calls-for-release-of-last-uk-guantanamo-detainee.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US and the UK to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19100">work towards the release</a> [press release] of Aamer. Allen called on Foreign Secretary William Hague and US officials to give a specific timetable for Aamer's release. The Hague and the US have been in discussions over Aamer's release, but no formal indications of a release have been made. The UK agrees that if Aamer is released, they will be wiling to accept him, as they did with former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">Binyam Mohammed</a> [JURIST report]. Aamer is one of 16 Guantanamo Bay detainees for whom the UK government recently announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] agreement for allegations of torture. Those allegations prompted the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">launch an investigation into torture allegations</a> in May, as well as issue a ruling that state intelligence agencies <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">cannot use secret evidence</a> [JURIST reports] in their defense against abuse. Aamer has been described as an activist within Guantanamo, negotiating with US military officials over camp conditions and organizing hunger strikes when conditions did not improve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Marshall</a> [official website] stated that it is the duty of the city to anticipate the needs of its citizens in a state of emergency, and to minimize last minute, individualized requests by persons with disabilities. Marshall ruled that Los Angeles' emergency preparedness program fails to proactively address the needs of all of its citizens. <blockquote>The City provides a comprehensive emergency preparedness program to the general public but it denies individuals with disabilities meaningful access to the program while the benefits of the program remain open and easily accessible to other residents. Because of the City&#8217;s failure to address their unique needs, individuals with disabilities are disproportionately vulnerable to harm in the event of an emergency or disaster. The City's practice of failing to address the needs of individuals with disabilities discriminates against such individuals by denying them meaningful access to the City's emergency preparedness program.</blockquote> Shawna L. Parks, counsel to the plaintiffs, also stated that the decision is not just a victory for people with disabilities and seniors but for all Los Angeles residents who need to know that the city is prepared when disaster strikes. City officials have been ordered to meet with the parties that brought the lawsuit within three weeks to come up with a plan that better accounts for all. This is the first decision of its type in the nations history.

<p>This federal class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of all people with disabilities in Los Angeles, which is estimated to be around 800,000 individuals. The complaint was filed in January 2009 by Audrey Harthorn and a nonprofit independent living center located in downtown Los Angeles, <a href="http://www.calif-ilc.org/">Communities Actively Living Independent and Free</a> [official website]. The plaintiffs are represented by <a href="http://www.dralegal.org/">Disability Rights Advocates</a> [official website] and the <a href="http://disabilityrightslegalcenter.org/">Disability Rights Legal Center</a> [official website]. Advocates stated that the need for a plan encompassing the disabled was highlighted during Hurricane Katrina, as mortality rates among the disabled and seniors were drastically disproportionate. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In dismissing plaintiff Joseph Casias' lawsuit, Judge Robert Jonker determined that the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%2825v2i0bs52jxpi45skttxm55%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Initiated-Law-1-of-2008">Michigan Medical Marijuana Act</a> (MMMA) [materials] is in place to protect licensed medical marijuana users, but employers are not prohibited from adopting policies that ban marijuana use regardless of cause. Casias was administered a drug test per Wal-Mart policy, tested positive, and was subsequently notified of the termination of his at-will employment. As Jonker stated in the opinion, the MMMA does not regulate private employment: <blockquote>Nowhere does the MMMA state that the statute regulates private employment, that private employees are protected from disciplinary action should they use medical marijuana, or that private employers must accommodate the use of medical marijuana outside of the workplace. Under Plaintiff's theory, no private employer in Michigan could take any action against an employee based on an employee's use of medical marijuana. This would create a new protected employee class in Michigan and mark a radical departure from the general rule of at-will employment in Michigan.</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] said it will <a href="http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform/aclu-appeal-todays-dismissal-lawsuit-against-wal-mart-firing-cancer-patient-who-lega">appeal the ruling</a> [press release], arguing that the court's decision does not uphold the intentions of Michigan voters.  

<p>Courts have been forced to interpret state medical marijuana statutes in recent years. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S164830.PDF">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">report</a>] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. Earlier that month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. California's Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report], and does not violate the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed changes meet many of the demands made by protesters in Egypt, but the military did not address protesters' demands to lift the <a href="http://www.emerglobal.com/lex/law-1958-162">emergency laws</a> [text, in Arabic] that have been in place for 30 years. Perhaps partly due to this omission, Egyptians continued to protest in Cairo's main square on Sunday, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/thousands-flood-cairo-square-defying-army-bid-to-quell-protests-1.343111">defying an order by the military</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report] to disperse.

<p>The military had earlier <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">pledged to lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that have been in place since former President <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] assumed power. Prior to Mubarak's resignation, Egypt's government had <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/joint-egypt-panel-to-study-constitutional-reform.php">reached out</a> [JURIST report] to various opposition leaders in the wake of demonstrations that have swept the country. Among those in the opposition that have been approached are the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website], the oldest and largest Islamic political group in the world, currently banned from Egypt. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is closely related to the recent <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">civil unrest in Tunisia</a> [JURIST op-ed] that culminated last month with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court determined Musharraf had not cooperated during the investigation of Bhutto's death, and investigators have alleged that <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/02/13/warrants-issued-for-musharraf.html">Musharraf did not provide adequate security</a> [DAWN report] for Bhutto when she was assassinated during a campaign rally in Pakistan in 2007. According to an interim criminal charge sheet <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">issued last week</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/">Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan</a> (FIA) [official website], Musharraf appointed and allegedly gave orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto on the day she was assassinated. Specifically, the prosecution document alleges that Musharraf ordered the officers to remove a security detail for Bhutto prior to her departure and that he later ordered the same officers to hose down the scene of the assassination. Fawad Chaudry, a spokesman for Musharraf's All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) Party, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Musharraf-will-not-comply-with-Pakistan-warrant-Spokesman/articleshow/7482407.cms">told reporters</a> [Times of India report] that Mushattaf would not comply with the warrant, which demands he appear in Pakistan February 19 for a court date, saying there is "no possibility" that Musharraf will appear in court. According to an unnamed FIA official, Pakistan <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/118167/benazir-assassination-case-musharrafs-extradition-to-be-sought-following-warrant/">will seek extradition</a> [Express Tribune report] of Musharraf, who is living in exile in London.

<p>In January, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Salman Taseer, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">was assassinated</a> [JURIST report] by one of his own security guards, apparently due to his opposition to Pakistan's <a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net/Shaikh/blasphemy_laws_in_pakistan.htm">blasphemy law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+blasphemy">news archive</a>]. Taseer, a senior member of the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a> (PPP) [official website], was shot while getting into his car at Islamabad's Kohsar Market and died later at a hospital. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the guard immediately surrendered to police and confessed to shooting Taseer because he had spoken against the blasphemy law. This was the most high-profile assassination since <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">that of Bhutto in 2007</a> [JURIST report] and again involved issues of security. The Pakistani government and police forces have been criticized for their part in Bhutto's assassination. In April 2010, an independent UN commission formed to investigate the assassination issued a report holding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-commission-report-blames-pakistan.php">Pakistani government and police forces responsible</a> [JURIST report] for failing to provide adequate security. The report also accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into the assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bashir is charged with <a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/bashirs-aceh-camp-start-of-islamic-state-prosecutors/422648">operating a terrorist training camp</a> [<em>Jakarta Globe</em> report] in the mountains of the northwestern province of Aceh to prepare Islamic radicals to carry out attacks in the capital of Jakarta. Prosecutors allege that this group was also planning attacks modeled after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mumbai+attacks">Mumbai attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and were targeting high-profile members of the Indonesian government, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8127421.stm">President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [BBC profile]. It was also charged at the opening of the trial that <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2011/02/201121442836375689.html">Bashir aimed to establish an Islamic state</a> [Al Jazeera report], using the province of Aceh as a base from which to conduct operations. He also allegedly amassed Rp1 billion (USD $112,285) to purchase weapons for the group, and sought to justify robberies and murder to his followers as a necessary tool in waging a holy war, according to the prosecutor. In addition to multiple terror charges, Bashir is also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12445335">charged with mobilizing people to commit terrorist acts</a> [BBC report], charges that carry a potential death sentence. Following Monday's proceedings, the trial adjourned until Thursday when the defense will begin preliminary arguments. Bashir has maintained his innocence, arguing that the charges against him are part of a US conspiracy.

<p>Bashir was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/radical-indonesia-cleric-charged-with-terrorism-charges.php">originally charged in August</a> [JURIST report], and was suspected of links to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9126/alqaeda_aka_alqaida_alqaida.html">al Qaeda</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">news archive</a>]. He is also suspected of ties to <a href="http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/jemaah.html">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder], a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda that has been implicated in a multitude of attacks in Indonesia, including the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bali+nightclub">2002 Bali nightclub bombing</a> [JURIST news archive] that left more than 200 people dead. In 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/indonesia-high-court-overturns.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Bashir's conviction on conspiracy charges connecting him with the 2002 Bali bombings. He was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-distressed-over-release-of.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] earlier in 2006 after spending 26 months in jail on different charges related to the bombings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Natalya Vasilyeva made the allegations in an interview she gave to <a href="http://gazeta.ru/">Gazeta.ru website</a> [official website] and the TV channel Dozjd. According to Vasilyeva, Danilkin, a judge for the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovnichesky District Court</a> [official website, in Russian], was pressured and coached by officials from the Moscow City Court. "When something happened, when something went wrong, he had a duty to provide information to the Moscow City Court and, accordingly, received certain instructions on how to behave," she said. At the end of the trial, Danilkin wrote a verdict, but Vasilyeva said it probably "did not satisfy the higher ups" and he was therefore given a different verdict, which he was ordered to issue. Danilkin has responded to Vasilyeva's comments calling them <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2308757.html">slander</a> [RFE/RL report]. </p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bW2P70J25Sw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p>In December, Danilkin <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky and his business partner, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=platon+lebedev">news archive</a>], to six additional years in prison, extending their imprisonment to a total of 14 years. Their defense counsel staunchly criticized the ruling, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission. The verdict drew vehement <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution." The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable." The men are currently serving eight-year prison sentences for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], to which they were sentenced in 2005 for the same money laundering from Yukos.

In March, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement comes after large demonstrations erupted across the country, with thousands violating a police ban by protesting in the capital Algiers. Medelci said that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was considering making concessions and adjusting the government. Bouteflika's comments earlier this month also suggested an end to the state of emergency. 

<p>Algeria has been under a state of emergency since 1992 when the military <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021401386.html">canceled elections</a> [WP report] fearing a win by religious fundamentalists. The state of emergency was <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm">declared</a> [DOS backgrounder] after it became apparent that the militant Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would win control of the government. The FIS grew in popularity after Algeria's new constitution in 1989 that allowed multiple political parties. Bouteflika came to power, winning the presidency in 1999 with 70 percent of the official vote and appearing to have the backing of the military. Algeria has struggled to maintain a stable government since gaining its independence from France in 1961. Voters in France <a href="/thisday/2009/01/france-approves-self-determination-for.php">overwhelmingly approved self-determination</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for Algeria on January 8, 1961, by a 75 percent margin, ending nearly a decade of fighting in the French-Algerian War. On July 1, 1961, Algerians elected to become an independent nation by a near-unanimous margin. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill will now <a href="http://www.necn.com/02/11/11/Civil-unions-moving-toward-becoming-law-/landing_politics.html?&blockID=3&apID=f712598b56d94d8b984c318d86aa5da5">advance to the state Senate</a> [AP report] for a vote before reaching the desk of Hawaii's new democratic governor, <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov">Neil Abercrombie</a> [official website], who has previously voiced his support for civil unions. If successful, the bill will not only recognize civil unions, but will also provide partners lawfully entering into them with "all the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law" as are granted to individuals entering into marriage. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">similar bill was vetoed</a> [JURIST report] in July by former governor Linda Lingle (R), who felt that, because it was an issue of "such significant societal importance," it was better suited for a vote in a public referendum. Hawaii would be the seventh state to offer essentially the same benefits and protections afforded to marriages to civil unions.

<p>Earlier this month, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn (D) <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions in the state. The "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." Additionally, it would allow religious institutions within the state to choose whether to observe or officiate the union. Opponents fear that this bill will move Illinois closer to legalizing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] and threaten the sanctity of marriage. The new law is set to take effect on June 1. In contrast, last month the Wyoming Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-senate-advances--banning-same-sex-marraige.php">voted 20-10 in favor of a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages from any jurisdiction. The decision, which was split down party lines, will advance to the state House of Representatives, where it needs a two-thirds vote to succeed. If approved there, it will need to be signed by Governor Matt Mead (R) and then appear as a referendum item on the 2012 ballot. The following day, the House Judiciary Committee also <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_ce747eaa-2aff-11e0-b207-001cc4c03286.html">voted 5-4</a> [Star-Tribune report] to defeat House Bill 150, which would have recognized civil unions in the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs claim that <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/ase/japan/japan_civ_code.htm">Article 750 of the Japan Civil Code</a>, requiring a husband and wife to assume the same surname when married, violates <a href="http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html">Articles 13 and 24 of the Japanese Constitution</a> [texts], which ensures respect for individuals and equality between husband and wife in a marriage. Filing the first lawsuit challenging the surname requirement, the plaintiffs argue that, while the constitution requires equal rights between partners, the civil code requires the bias of one by forcing them to choose a single surname. The case also challenges the government of <a href="http://www.n-kan.jp/">Prime Minister Naoto Kan</a> [official website, in Japanese], whose Democratic party, when elected in 2009, promised, but failed to pass legislation amending the one-surname law. The plaintiffs, four women and one of their husbands, are demanding that local government offices accept marriage certificates listing different surnames and seek six million yen (USD $70,000) in <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gUUQJLZTaO8C4BpKr04uG8LO-uxw?docId=CNG.f6fcd5bb2a7f891c8156a12d7845d240.a71">damages</a> [AFP report] from the government for emotional distress.  

<p>In 1996, the Japanese <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/index.html">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Japanese] Legislative Counsel <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/women_rep5/part2_16.html">outlined an amendment to the Civil Code</a> [text], proposing that couples may retain their respective surnames. Again last year, the Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/ministry-outlines-separate-surnames-plan-civil-code-revision">proposed a similar amendment</a> [<em>Japan Today</em> report] after a <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/hisho/kouhou/kaiken_point_sp100219-01.html">policy meeting</a> [transcript, in Japanese]. However, due to political opposition, no further actions were ever taken on either of the proposals. Japan is the last remaining member of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/3777557.stm">Group of Eight</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=g8">news archive</a>] nations to require that married couples have the same surname. Civil advocates argue that the forcible use of one surname implicates serious human rights abuses. In 2009, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a> [text] <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=CEDAW/C/JPN/5&Lang=E">urged Japan</a> [UN report, PDF] to eliminate the "discriminatory" one-surname requirement and "take immediate action to amend the Civil Code."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Qadri reportedly told the court that he did <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i2cn4FlkAMCjxFy-FxYJcGrJwjFA?docId=CNG.9d00ea2df5d6129be7cac650dbbd7208.b1">not murder anyone intentionally</a> [AFP report] but had taught a lesson to an apostate. The next hearing is scheduled for February 26, and witnesses and evidence will be presented. Taseer's assassination has increased tensions in Pakistan, as the nation's religious right has publicly praised Qadri for his actions, bringing the liberal elite's reform efforts to a halt. Pakistan has never executed anyone under its blasphemy law, and most sentences are overturned or commuted by appellate courts. This is the most high-profile assassination in Pakistan since the 2007 assassination of former prime minister and <a href="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v6.57/t.gif">Pakistan People's Party </a> (PPP) [official website] leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>].

<p>Taseer <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">was shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] on January 4, while getting into his car at Islamabad's Kohsar Market by one of his own security guards, apparently because of his opposition to Pakistan's blasphemy law. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the guard immediately surrendered to police and confessed to shooting Taseer because he had spoken against the blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year. Tasseer had spoken in Bibi's defense. In December, the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> (LHC) [official website] <a href="paperchase/2010/12/pakistan-court-delays-efforts-to-amend-blasphemy-laws.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a stay against any amendments to Pakistan's blasphemy laws pending further proceedings. The blasphemy laws were introduced in 1986 as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults. In response to the repeated calls for repeal, Pakistani <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Mom/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNLE_1wkA6zeAMcwNEAIo_LBEMTfT-P_NxU_YLs7DRHR0VFAGW7A9Q%21/dl2/d1/L0lDU0lKSWdrbUEhIS9JRFJBQUlpQ2dBek15cXchL1lCSkoxTkExTkk1MC01RncvN19VRkpQQ0dDMjBPVVFFMDJFVDlGTVBKMzBPMC9Ga19fXzE3/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_UFJPCGC20OUQE02ET9FMPJ30O0_WCM&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MomCL/ministry/about/minister">Federal Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti</a> [official profile] has said the laws may be amended to prevent misuse, but they will not be repealed.

The judiciary has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021300394.html">set up a special prosecutors office</a> [AP report] to handle alleged offenses committed in media and cultural platforms. Both the court and office will operate under the supervision of Tehran's chief prosecutor. The head of Iran's Government Employees Court, Abbas Zagholi, said the new court is necessary because of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/13/iran.media.crimes/index.html">advances in mass media</a> [CNN report]. Opponents, however, worry that the new court will be used to crack down on dissidents. The new court is set to begin operations next month.

<p>Iran has faced criticism in its efforts to control the media following the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].

Media freedom group <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] stated that it was the longest sentence ever imposed on a blogger in Iran and urged <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10866448">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahmadinejad">news archive</a>] to intercede.

Kepiro was convicted both in 1944 and 1946 and sentenced to 10 years for involvement in the raids. He was, however, released, and promptly fled to Argentina. The <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish human rights organization committed to finding and prosecuting Holocaust war criminals, is responsible for finding the former Hungarian military officer in 2006 helping bring him into the custody of Budapest officials.  SWC Israel director Dr. Efraim Zuroff, <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441467&ct=9121477">expressed the importance</a> [press release] of convicting their top-listed Nazi criminal and its impact on Hungarian society: <blockquote>It is they [the families of victims] who so deserve that justice finally be achieved in this case, so that they can finally achieve a measure of closure, even if it is many years after the crimes. 

<p>The indictment of Kepiro also sends a powerful message that the passage of time does not diminish the guilt of the killers and that old age should not protect those who committed such heinous crimes. ... [W]e finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</blockquote>Kepiro has denied all charges. His lawyers have expressed confidence that the Hungarian prosecutors will not produce sufficient documentation to uphold his conviction. </p>

<p>One of the major goals of SWC is to prosecute Nazi criminal suspects before they die. Kepiro, 97, is at the top of the list for oldest Nazi criminal suspects that have been convicted for war crimes. In November, Nazi guard <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial. He was accused of aiding in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Jewish people at the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/belzec.html">Belzec concentration camp</a> [HRP backgrounder]. In November, alleged Nazi death camp prison guard <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1887487,00.html">John Demjanjuk</a>, 90, [TIME profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=John+Demjanjuk">news archive]</a>  <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/alleged-nazi-guard-accuses-judges-in-germany-trial-of-bias.php">accused the German judges</a> [JURIST report] conducting his <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/91023/">trial of bias</a> [text] after the they rejected a number of  23  defense petitions to discontinue his trial.

Chevron <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/02142011_illegitimatejudgmentagainstchevroninecuadorlawsuit.news">vowed to fight the ruling</a> [press release], calling it "illegitimate and unenforceable" and "the product of fraud." The plaintiffs' lawyer said he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/world/americas/15ecuador.html?_r=1&src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB">also plans to appeal</a> [NYT report], after the court awarded far less than the $113 billion for which the plaintiffs reportedly asked. It is unclear when, if ever, the Chevron will <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703584804576144464044068664.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">pay the judgment</a> [WSJ report]. Chevron has no assets in Ecuador, and it recently won rulings from a <a href="http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/TribunalInterimMeasuresOrder.pdf">panel of arbitrators</a> [order, PDF] at the <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] in The Hague and a <a href="http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/SDNYRestrainingOrder.pdf">judgement</a> [order, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] temporarily barring the enforcement of any judgment against Chevron. 

<p>Earlier this month, Chevron <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/02012011_chevronfilesfraudandricocaseagainstlawyersandconsultantsbehindecuadorlitigation.news">filed a lawsuit</a> [press release] against plaintiffs' lawyers and consultants in the case, claiming that professionals for the plaintiffs were attempting to extort Chevron. In July, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/entertainment/la-et-crude-20100716">upheld</a> [LAT report] a <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/judge-rules-that-filmmaker-must-give-footage-to-chevron/">May ruling</a> [NYT report] by the Southern District of New York ordering filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over to Chevron certain outtakes from his 2009 documentary <a href="http://www.crudethemovie.com/"><em>Crude</em></a> [film website]. Chevron claims the outtakes show plaintiffs' lawyers discussing illegal and unethical tactics, including ghost-writing a court appointed expert's report, intimidating a judge and colluding with government officials. Chevron claims to have evidence that the plaintiffs influenced a court appointed expert who, in 2009, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0713/texaco-ecuador-pollution-chevrons-27-billion-problem.html">recommended Chevron be found liable</a> [Forbes report] for $27 billion. The suit was <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LCT1G00.htm">re-filed in Ecuador</a> [AP report] in 2003 after being dismissed by the Southern District of New York in 1996. Chevron claims that a 1995 cleanup agreement between Ecuador and Texaco that was completed in 1998 at a cost of $40 million absolves Chevron of all liability. Plaintiffs originally filed suit against Texaco, which operated the oil fields from the 1960's until the early 1990's, in the Southern District of New York in 1993.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A vote on the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.00514:">bill</a> [HR 514] to extend the provisions <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/patriot-act-extension-fails-in-house.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] last weak under a special rule that required a two-thirds majority, but passed Monday with a simple majority. The provisions set to expire included the authority: for roving surveillance, including wire-taps and cell phone monitoring; to compel production of business records and "other tangible things" under section 215 of the Act; and to allow the US to target non-US persons "who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist group," under the "lone wolf" amendment, section 6001. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has been an outspoken critic of the Patriot Act. ACLU legislative counsel Michelle Richardson <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/house-passes-extension-overbroad-patriot-act-provisions">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>It has been nearly a decade since the Patriot Act was passed and our lawmakers still refuse to make any meaningful changes to this reactionary law. The right to privacy from government is a cornerstone of our country's foundation and Americans must be free from the kind of unwarranted government surveillance that the Patriot Act allows. If Congress cannot take the time to insert the much needed privacy safeguards the Patriot Act needs, it should allow these provisions to expire.</blockquote>Though most Republicans supported the Bill, the vote did <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/us/politics/15terror.html">not come down on strict party lines</a> [NYT report] with 65 Democrats voting in favor of it, including Representative <a href="http://dutch.house.gov/">CA Dutch Ruppersberger</a> (D-MD) [official website], the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

<p>Earlier this month, the Obama administration released a <a href = "http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">Statement of Administration Policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the provisions, but expressed support for the Bill passed Monday. The provisions were previously <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended in February 2010</a> after the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> [JURIST reports] the Patriot Act. The <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-rejects-patriot-act.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the Patriot Act in December 2009 due to lack of standing. The <a href = "http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> [official website] had previously ruled that <a href = "/paperchase/2007/09/federal-judge-rules-patriot-act.php">certain provisions of the act were unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The Patriot Act was passed in 2001, on the heels of the 9/11 attacks, greatly expanding US law enforcement's powers of surveillance and discretion when conducting terrorism investigations, and the US Government's ability to regulate foreign individuals' and immigrants' financial transactions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">highlight what it claims are problems</a> [JURIST report] with the detention system currently used by the US for dealing with suspected terrorists. The detainee, Awal Gul, had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002, suspected of having <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF]. Gul died of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises. The CCR believes that the circumstances surrounding Gul's death illustrate the inherent problem with the detention center and the policy the US follows in detaining and indefinitely holding suspected terrorists, claiming that the facility has become a purgatory, where people are held indefinitely. As the number of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility decreases, the issue of what to do with those remaining in US custody continues to be a significant issue. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

EU member states have attempted to establish a uniform patent system for several years, but a unanimous vote was unobtainable due to disapproval from a few member countries. The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Lisbon Treaty</a> [text] generally requires a unanimous vote from EU member states, but the <a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/enhanced_cooperation_en.htm">"enhanced co-operation"</a> [EU backgrounder] provision allows groups of member states to adopt new common rules when unanimity is difficult to achieve.

The <a href="http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] will then submit its legislative proposals.

<p>The EU has applied the "enhanced co-operation" provision in only one other resolution.

Berlusconi allegedly paid 7,000 euros to then 17-year-old dancer, Karima El Mahroug, for sex and later <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12083491">called police to secure her release</a> [BBC report] while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. Berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing and lashed out at the charges, calling them <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-15/berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-prostitution-charge.html">groundless</a> [Bloomberg report]. Judge Cristina di Censo announced the indictment against the premier, which included approving a request from prosecutors to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/02/15/italy.berlusconi.trial/index.html">expedite the trial</a> [CNN report], which is set to begin on April 6 in Milan. The expedited trial skips the preliminary hearing and is approved in cases with overwhelming evidence. The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357182/Silvio-Berlusconi-WILL-face-trial-sex-17-year-old-Moroccan-belly-dancer.html">prosecution has submitted</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] 782 pages of wire taps, intercepted text messages and bank details as part of the case. The trial will be heard by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/15/AR2011021500612.html">three randomly-selected judges</a> [WP report], all women. Berlusconi's legal team has argued that the judge does not have the power to order the trial of the premier.

<p>Although not the first political scandal for Berlusconi, this recent fiasco has prompted widespread demonstrations and renewed calls for the premier to step down. Last month, the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">law</a> [materials, in Italian] backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office. The court ruled in a vote of 12-3 to modify the law to allow up to a six-month postponement of charges, and gave the court the power to assess the severity of the charges in relation to how much they would disrupt state business. In October, Italian prosecutors launched a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/prosecutors-launch-tax-inquiry-against-italy-pm-berlusconi.php">tax inquiry against Berlusconi</a> [JURIST report] for tax declarations he made in 2003 and 2004 relating to the commercial broadcast company <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian], which Berlusconi founded. The investigation is the fourth time Berlusconi has faced allegations of fraud in relation to his Mediaset company. In addition to the trial for abuse of power and underage prostitution, Berlusconi faces three other ongoing judicial proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

When the council assumed power on Sunday, it indicated that part of its <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1102/S00429/egypt-constitutional-proclamation.htm">transition plan</a> [proclamation text] was to form a committee to amend constitutional articles prior to holding a public referendum. The plan follows the intentions of ousted president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile], who had approved the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-vp-announces-political-agreements-and-committee-to-reform-constitution.php">formation of a panel</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution before he resigned. The changes may also allow the creation of new political parties. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is currently banned in Egypt, announced on Tuesday that it will <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-egypt-constitution-20110216,0,5662653.story">form a party</a> [LAT report] to participate in upcoming elections. Critics say that 10 days is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8326469/Egypt-Islamist-judge-to-head-new-constitution-committee.html">not enough time</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] for the committee to make substantial changes to the constitution, such as abolishing Article 2, which upholds <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia">news archive</a>]. However, the new committee also suggests that the military council is on track to <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Egypt-military-plans-constitution-referendum-soon/750598">hold elections in six months</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] and return power to the Egyptian people. 

<p>The military pledged last week to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that have been in place since Mubarak assumed power. Prior to Mubarak's resignation, Egypt's government had <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/joint-egypt-panel-to-study-constitutional-reform.php">reached out</a> [JURIST report] to various opposition leaders in the wake of demonstrations that swept the country. Among those in the opposition that have been approached are the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest and largest Islamic political group in the world. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is closely related to the recent <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">civil unrest in Tunisia</a> [JURIST op-ed] that culminated last month with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <em>per curiam</em> opinion, the judges stated that the lower court's decision was inconsistent with current laws on detainees, and that, since advances in the law had been made since Hatim's case came to trial, his case must be reconsidered:<blockquote>The district court ruled that the military could detain only individuals who were "part of" al-Qaida or the Taliban; and that Hatim did not fit that description. That ruling is directly contrary to Al-Bihani v. Obama, which held that "those who purposefully and materially support" al-Qaida or the Taliban could also be detained. Hatim admits the error, but says it was harmless. We cannot see how. As the district court stated in issuing the stay, Al-Bihani "calls into question" a "key determination" upon which the  order rested. The district court also ruled that in order to detain Hatim the government had to prove that he was part of the "command structure" of al-Qaida or the Taliban. Our intervening decisions in Bensayah v. Obama and Awad v. Obama held that although it is sufficient to show that an individual is in the command structure, such a showing is not necessary in order to defeat a habeas petition.</blockquote>A judge for the <a href = "http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.law.northwestern.edu/macarthur/guantanamo/caselisting/documents/Hatim%20DDC.pdf">granted</a> [opinion, PDF] Hatim's petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> in December 2009, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-orders-release-of-yemeni.php">ordering his release</a> [JURIST report]. The US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] alleged that Hatim trained at the al Farouq paramilitary camp in Afghanistan. Tuesday's opinion ordered future proceedings in Washington's federal trial court.

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, detainee <a href = "http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsNoor.html">Noor Uthman Mohammed</a> [DOD materials] <a href = "http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14266">pleaded guilty</a> [press release] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/guantanamo-detainee-pleads-guilty-to-terror-charges-before-military-tribunal.php">before a military tribunal to terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report].  Earlier this month, the <a href = "http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">highlight what it claims are problems</a> [JURIST report] with the detention system currently used by the US for dealing with suspected terrorists. The detainee, Awal Gul, had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002, suspected of having <a href = "http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF]. Gul died of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises. The CCR believes that the circumstances surrounding Gul's death illustrate the inherent problem with the detention center and the policy the US follows in detaining and indefinitely holding suspected terrorists, claiming that the facility has become a purgatory, where people are held indefinitely. As the number of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility decreases, the issue of what to do with those remaining in US custody continues to be a significant issue. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed amendment, which <a href="http://www.southbendtribune.com/article/20110216/News01/102160319/1011/News">passed by a margin of 70-26</a> [<em>South Bend Tribune</em> report], reads: "Only a marriage between one (1) man and one (1) woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Indiana. A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized." In order to become law, Indiana's constitution <a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-16.html">requires</a> [Art 16 text] that both houses of the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">General Assembly</a> [official website] approve the resolution, that both houses of the next separately elected General Assembly approve the resolution, and finally that the voters approve the resolution after it has been approved by consecutive General Assemblies. This means that the resolution cannot take effect until at least 2014. The Indiana Senate has yet to vote on the resolution.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/house/house.asp">Hawaii House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-house-passes-bill-recognizing-same-sex-civil-unions.php">legalizing same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST report] in the state. The bill must still survive a vote in the state senate and be signed by Governor Neil Abercrombie. Earlier this month, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn (D) <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions in the state. The "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." The law, which opponents fear move Illinois closer to approving same-sex marriage, will go into effect June 1. Last month the Wyoming Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-senate-advances--banning-same-sex-marraige.php">voted 20-10 in favor of a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages from any jurisdiction. The decision, which was split down party lines, will advance to the state House of Representatives, where it needs a two-thirds vote to succeed. If approved there, it will need to be signed by Governor Matt Mead (R) and then appear as a referendum item on the 2012 ballot. The following day, the House Judiciary Committee also <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_ce747eaa-2aff-11e0-b207-001cc4c03286.html">voted 5-4</a> [Star-Tribune report] to defeat House Bill 150, which would have recognized civil unions in the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month in order to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. In its ruling, the court stated that they are bound by statute to define the term terrorism using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF] and that they may not apply any international definition of terrorism. The court held that, under Article 314 of the criminal code, a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger." In order to define the term "means," the court examined Lebanese case law, which offered a narrow interpretation of the term, limiting the definition to a specific list enumerated in the code. The court rejected the narrow interpretation for the purposes of the international tribunal, stating:<blockquote>[W]hile fully respecting the Lebanese jurisprudence relating to cases of terrorism brought before Lebanese courts, the Tribunal cannot but take into account the unique gravity and transnational dimension of the facts at issue and the Security Council's consideration of them as particularly grave international acts of terrorism justifying the establishment of an international court. As a result, for the purpose of adjudicating these facts, the Tribunal is justified in applying, at least in one respect, a construction of the Lebanese Criminal Code's definition of terrorism that does not necessarily coincide with that the construction suggested by Lebanese courts.</blockquote>Instead of defining means by the enumerated list, the court held that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case.  

<p>The court's ruling is expected to clear the way for the pretrial judge to determine whether to confirm a sealed <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/Press/prosectution/STL_Prosecutor_video_statement_transcript_en.pdf">indictment</a> [statement, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/239">press release</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-lebanon-tribunal-hands-down-sealed-indictment-in-hariri-assassination-case.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last month by STL prosecutors and charging an unknown number of people for their roles in Hariri's assassination. The names of those indicted will be <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=123808#axzz1BOW9WVLn">kept confidential</a> [<em>Lebanon Daily Star</em> report] until the pretrial judge reviews and approves the indictment, but many believe that the indictment names members of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder]. In August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. Last February, the head of the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/lebanon-tribunal-head-says-hariri-probe.php">reassured</a> [JURIST report] the Lebanese public that the investigation is on track. When asked about the progress of the investigation into the death of Hariri, the head of the STL "underlined the fact that the Tribunal already has in place all the legal and administrative instruments necessary for its work, and is fully operational so that justice may be dispensed with complete independence and impartiality in accordance with the highest international standards." The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay stated that "authorities everywhere must scrupulously avoid excessive use of force, which is strictly forbidden in international law. They must conduct prompt, impartial and transparent investigations where there have been breaches of this obligation." Pillay emphasized the importance of freedom of expression and the right of peaceful assembly for Bahrain's stability. Pillay also stressed that Bahrain has an obligation to respect human rights as a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. The protest in Bahrain, calling for democratic change, was sparked by the uprising in Egypt that ousted the 30-year reign of <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile].

Pillay emphasized the importance of protecting human rights during a time of political change in the region. In January, shortly after the protests in Egypt began, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon </a>[official website] and Pillay urged the Egyptian government to exercise restraint and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">respect the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report].

The court amended without explanation two of the <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/pdf/preguntas_referendo.pdf">10 referendum questions</a> [text, PDF; in Spanish] that Correa <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ecuador-president-proposes-constitutional-reforms-to-combat-rising-crime.php">offered</a> [JURIST report] last month, but otherwise <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h2xhYf4uKXnffvlTMXnvlOfxUKfg?docId=CNG.6e7d38f3d3563d211f3069125ba98dc4.2d1">authorized</a> [AFP report] the proposals to proceed to the Electoral Council for approval. The proposed reforms would alter the way judges are chosen, amend a preventative detention law and revoke measures intended to protect those accused of serious crimes. In addition, the questions probe public support for restricting media companies from owning non-media companies and limiting banking entities to financial services. Opponents have claimed that the measures are aimed at solidifying power and quieting dissent, and have accused Correa of following the authoritarian model of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

<p>In October, the Ecuadorian government announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ecuador-to-revise-austerity-law-following-unrest.php">revise a controversial austerity law following unrest</a> [JURIST report] and a suspected coup attempt in September. Police officers fired tear gas at Correa, surrounded the hospital at which he was being treated and trapped him there for 12 hours while protesting the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/Ley%20Org%C3%83%C2%A1nica%20del%20Servicio%20P%C3%83%C2%BAblico.pdf">public service law</a> [text, PDF; in Spanish], which they feared would reduce their pay and benefits. In September 2008, Ecuadorian voters overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-in.php">approved a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] that consolidated and significantly expanded the powers held by Correa, including the power to dissolve the legislature and pass laws by decree. The Special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-by.php">provisionally approved</a> [JURIST report] the document in July 2008. The success of Correa's referendum fulfilled his pledge to rewrite the country's constitution after his coalition's <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-ruling-coalition-wins-majority.php">landslide victory</a> [JURIST report] in October 2007.

Bates of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Bates-order-on-Bagram-2-15-11.pdf">granted a motion to amend</a> [order, PDF] petitions for writs of <em>habeas corpus</em> on Tuesday for four detainees held at <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Force Base</a> (Bagram) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bagram">news archive</a>]. Bates' <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Bates-on-Bagram-2-15-11.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] granted the amended petition on the basis of new evidence offered by the petitioners, including assertions that civilian criminal trials for Afghan nationals have begun in Bagram, that movement and retention of detainees in Afghanistan reflects the Executive Branch's aim to avoid judicial scrutiny of detention policies, and that there are plans to hold non-Afghans in order to avoid obligations before courts. The petitioners claim that the new evidence undercuts the jurisdictional analysis applied by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in its May 21, 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dc-circuit-dismisses-bagram-detainee-habeas-petitions.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] denying the defendants' <em>habeas corpus</em> challenge. The respondents countered that the new information is not factually based and would not change the court's analysis of the issue. Bates expressed doubts regarding the success of the petitioners amended writ, but allowed the motion to amend concluding that:<blockquote>While the Court has some doubts about the consequence of the additional evidence under that analytical framework, that issue is better explored through full consideration of the evidence and the parties' positions, rather than under the limited "futility" appraisal in which it is now presented. That will, moreover, be consistent with Rule 15's strong encouragement of amendment -- if the facts presented may enable relief then amendment should be "freely given" and a plaintiff should be permitted the opportunity to have the claims tested on their merits.</blockquote>
Bates denied the petitioners request for jurisdictional discovery. He instead directed them to assert the jurisdictional discovery issue in opposition to the expected request to dismiss the amended <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. The amended petitions must be filed by March 28, 2011. 

<p>The DC District Court has been the venue for many <em>habeas</em> challenges during the course of the war on terror. In April 2010, Judge Thomas Hogan <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-dismisses-105-former.php">dismissed as moot</a> [JURIST report] 105 <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions of former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees no longer in US custody. Hogan wrote that in deciding the case, the court was answering one of the questions left open by the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [JURIST report], "what happens to a Guantanamo detainee's <em>habeas</em> claim once he is transferred or released." In June 2009, Bates <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-court-stays-habeas-proceedings.php">granted</a> a government <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-to-appeal-bagram.php">motion</a> [JURIST reports] to certify and suspend these defendants' <em>habeas</em> petitions, pending appeal to the Circuit Court. The certification allowed the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to seek interlocutory appeal from the DC Circuit. The DC Circuit's decision to deny <em>habeas corpus</em> relief in May 2010 drew <a href="/forum/2010/05/the-bagram-habeas-ruling.php">criticism from commentators</a> [JURIST op-ed] who stated that the decision provided the Executive branch with virtually unlimited cover to deny human rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Muse had originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/somalia-piracy-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-federal-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May to hijacking, kidnapping and taking hostages in the matter. Muse has claimed to be a minor at the time of the attack on the Maersk Alabama, an item used by his defense team in an <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/somaliaNews/idAFN1611538720110216">effort to have the sentence reduced</a> [Reuters report]. Judge Loretta Preska, unswayed by the defense, imposed a sentence on the high end of the range of possible sentences, saying that such a long prison term was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-16/somali-pirate-muse-gets-34-year-prison-sentence-for-indian-ocean-hijacking.html">necessary to deter piracy</a> [Bloomberg report]. 

<p>Piracy near the continent of Africa has become an increasingly serious problem for private shipowners and many nations. Also on Wednesday, a Norwegian ship owner suggested that pirates should be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jonEwOlq7wFpHHSoJaGozZwbTrGg?docId=3c228e121b9d44378f529a6ab52a2872">executed on the spot</a> [AP report] when they attempt to hijack ships, a stance that drew criticism from the Norwegian government. While private citizens have their own opinions, the tact by governments has been to arrest and imprison pirates. In November, a Somali pirate was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-30-years.php">sentenced to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge in Virginia for an attack on a Navy vessel.

The measures were set to expire on February 28. The provisions extended include roving wiretaps, "lone wolf" terrorism suspects and the government's ability to seize "any tangible items" in the course of surveillance. The vote garnered support from both parties, and was seen as a delay tactic to allow Congress to further debate and hold hearings over the controversial counter-terrorism law. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/senate-passes-short-term-extension-troublesome-patriot-act-provisions">released a statement</a> [press release] chiding the Senate's decision, but urged Congress to use the time permitted by the extension wisely:<blockquote>Every day that Congress continues to push back the February expiration deadline, the Patriot Act continues to erode one of Americans' most basic rights -- the freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into their privacy. If there has to be an extension of this law, we urge Congress to use the time well to finally rein in the pernicious impact of the intrusive provisions at stake.</blockquote>The bill will now be sent back to the US <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] for approval. 

<p>Earlier this week, the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/house-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a similar bill that would extend the three provisions until December. A vote on the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.00514:">bill</a> [HR 514] to extend the provisions <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/patriot-act-extension-fails-in-house.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] last week under a special rule that required a two-thirds majority, but passed Monday with a simple majority. Earlier this month, the Obama administration released a <a href = "http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the provisions, but expressed support for the bill passed Monday. The provisions were previously <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended in February 2010</a> after the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> [JURIST reports] the Patriot Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In November, <a href="http://trialcourts.nashville.gov/portal/page/portal/trialCourts/judges/ClaudiaBonnyman/">Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman</a> [official profile] ruled that the state's method of lethal injection <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101120/NEWS03/11200332/TN-judge-strikes-down-lethal-injection">violated</a> [<em>The Tennessean</em> report] the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentviii">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] after lawyers for death row inmate <a href="http://news.tennesseeanytime.org/node/6073">Stephen Michael West</a> [execution advisory] revealed evidence to the court that inmates were awake and in pain when the lethal drugs were administered. Bonnyman found that the current method did not specify a sufficient dosage of sodium thiopental, part of a three-drug "cocktail," to ensure the prisoner was fully anesthetized, allowing for "death by suffocation while the prisoner is unconscious." The state proposed a revised plan to confirm the prisoner is unconscious: having the warden call out his name, shake him, and brush his eyelashes. Bonnyman found the revised procedure, administering the two remaining drugs only once there were no signs of consciousness, <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110216/NEWS03/110216033/1969/NEWS/Judge-declares-lethal-injection-protocol-sufficient-?odyssey=nav|head">constitutional</a> [<em>The Tennessean</em> report]. After Bonnyman's November decision, the <a href="http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/">Tennessee Supreme Court</a> [official website] temporarily <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/tennessee-courts-again-address-humaneness-lethal-injection">stayed the executions</a> [<em>Nashville City Paper</em> report] of four prisoners, effectively placing the <a href="http://www.tn.gov/correction/media/deathpenalty.html">second moratorium on executions</a> [TN.gov backgrounder] in Tennessee in the last three years. 

<p>In September 2007, a federal judge held that Tennessee's <a href="http://tennessean.com/assets/pdf/DN71684430.PDF">revised death penalty protocols</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/federal-judge-rules-tennessee-lethal.php">report</a>], devised earlier that year by the Tennessee Department of Corrections at the request of then-governor Phil Bredesen, did not ensure that prisoners' are properly anesthetized before they receive a lethal injection and thus constitute "cruel and unusual" punishment. Bredesen ordered a <a href="http://www.tennesseeanytime.org/governor/AdminCMSServlet?action=viewFile&id=969">moratorium on executions</a> [executive order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/tennessee-governor-stops-executions.php">report</a>] earlier that year and directed the Tennessee Department of Corrections to review the manner in which death sentences are administered. Bredesen accepted new protocols and the state <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/tennessee-resumes-lethal-injection.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] under the new rules in May 2007. The protocol included more detailed guidelines for administering lethal injections but still includes a controversial three-drug "cocktail" which some said may be <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/lethal-injection-protocols-may-violate.php">ineffective in preventing inmates from suffering a painful death</a> [JURIST report]. The number of executions that took place in the US in 2010 was down 12 percent from 2009, according to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> (DPIC) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/2010YearEnd-Final.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-execution-rates-continue-to-drop-during-2010.php">report</a>]. DPIC attributes the decrease in executions to several factors, including controversy over lethal injections [JURIST news archive]. The report also states that a recent poll shows 61 percent of Americans would choose various alternative sentences over the death penalty as the proper punishment for murder. Executions resumed in the US in April 2008 after the Supreme Court lifted an effective ban on the death penalty by <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">upholding the constitutionality of lethal injection</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkaradzic2.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The trial chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Wednesday ordered the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tdec/en/110216.pdf">suspension</a> [decision, PDF] of the trial of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>] for six weeks beginning after witness testimonies already scheduled for March. The postponement allows Karadzic to review 32,000 pages and 200 hours of video material that the prosecution sent to him in January. In requesting the suspension, Karadzic alleged that he was prejudiced when he did not have all of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Rules_procedure_evidence/IT032Rev45_en.pdf">Rule 68</a> [text, PDF] exculpatory material in the possession of the Prosecution before he started his cross-examination of witnesses. The trial chamber orally granted the motion last week and wrote in its decision:<blockquote>The suggestion by the Prosecution that 32,000 pages of documents and 200 hours of video ... can be disclosed <em>en masse</em> to the Accused on a single day, with an expectation that he should be able to continuously review and incorporate this volume of material, if necessary, into the conduct of his defence is untenable. ... The Chamber is not satisfied that continuing with the trial proceedings, and allowing the Accused to later recall certain witnesses for further cross-examination following his review of the Disclosed Material, if necessary, is sufficient, in this instance, to ensure his fair trial rights. Moreover, it will not be, in practical terms, conducive to the smooth conduct of the trial. In reaching this conclusion the Chamber also notes that the pattern of disclosure violations in this case has continued and is mindful of the impact which this has had on the smooth and orderly conduct of the trial. ... The Chamber reiterates its deep concern about the volume of potentially exculpatory material which the Prosecution continues to disclose to the Accused, and the impact which this has had on the Accused's preparations and the smooth conduct of this trial.</blockquote>Karadzic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 war crimes charges</a> [indictment, PDF], including counts of genocide and murder, for alleged crimes he committed during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Karadzic is defending himself in court and has denied all of the charges against him.

<p>Karadzic's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icty-delays-karadzic-trial-for-one-month.php">previously suspended</a> [JURIST report] in November for a month to allow him to read 14,000 pages of evidence the prosecution sent to him in October. The court's decision to delay the trial was partially because of the prosecution's repeated violations of its obligation to disclose evidence to the accused. In September, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/karadzic-takes-stand-as-war-crimes-trial-resumes.php">trial resumed</a> [JURIST report] as Karadzic defended himself before the ICTY after repeated attempts to delay proceedings. The trial previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/karadzic-war-crimes-trial-resumes-with.php">resumed in April</a> [JURIST report], after the ICTY <a href="/pdf/KaradzicDecisionOnMotionToStay.pdf">denied</a> [judgment PDF, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/karadzic-fails-in-latest-bid-to-delay.php">report</a>] Karadzic's <a href="/pdf/KaradzicMotionToStay.pdf">attempt</a> [motion, PDF] to delay court proceedings, in which he argued a violation of his right to a fair hearing due to the court's rejection of evidentiary challenges. In March, Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/icty-denies-karadzic-appeal-to-delay.php">lost another motion</a> to postpone his war crimes trial for charges committed during the Bosnia conflict. Following repeated delays in the proceedings, the ICTY judges warned in September that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icty-judges-warn-karadzic-trial-likely-to-continue-until-2014.php">trial might continue until 2014</a> [JURIST report], which is two years longer than expected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Governor <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/about/governors-bio/neil-abercrombie.html">Neil Abercrombie</a> (D) [official profile] must now sign the bill into law within 10 days, and the law could <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/02/17/hawaii.civil.unions/?hpt=T2">come into effect</a> [CNN report] in January 2012. In a <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/in-the-news/statement-by-governor-abercrombie-on-passage-of-civil-union-bill">statement</a> [text], Abercrombie said the bill "represents equal rights for all the people of Hawaii," adding "I have always believed that civil unions respect our diversity, protect people's privacy, and reinforce our core values of equality and aloha." If signed, the bill will not only recognize civil unions, but will also provide partners lawfully entering into them with "all the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law" as are granted to individuals entering into marriage. Hawaii's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-house-passes-bill-recognizing-same-sex-civil-unions.php">approved the same bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week. A similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] in July by former governor Linda Lingle (R), who felt that, because it was an issue of "such significant societal importance," it was better suited for a vote in a public referendum. Hawaii would be the seventh state to offer essentially the same benefits and protections afforded to marriages to civil unions. 

<p>Earlier this month, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn (D) <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions in the state. The "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." Additionally, it would allow religious institutions within the state to choose whether to observe or officiate the union. Opponents fear that this bill will move Illinois closer to legalizing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] and threaten the sanctity of marriage. The new law is set to take effect on June 1. In contrast, last month the Wyoming Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-senate-advances--banning-same-sex-marraige.php">voted 20-10 in favor of a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages from any jurisdiction. The decision, which was split down party lines, will advance to the state House of Representatives, where it needs a two-thirds vote to succeed. If approved there, it will need to be signed by Governor Matt Mead (R) and then appear as a referendum item on the 2012 ballot. The following day, the House Judiciary Committee also <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_ce747eaa-2aff-11e0-b207-001cc4c03286.html">voted 5-4</a> [Star-Tribune report] to defeat House Bill 150, which would have recognized civil unions in the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In January, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/04/1016696o.pdf">asked</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">report</a>] the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether supporters of Proposition 8 have standing to defend the measure when state officials have refused to do so. The issue requires the court to interpret <a href="http://www.iandrinstitute.org/New%20IRI%20Website%20Info/I&R%20Research%20and%20History/I&R%20at%20the%20Statewide%20Level/Constitution%20and%20Statutes/California.pdf">Article II, Section 8 of the California Constitution</a> [text, PDF] to determine:<blockquote>Whether ... the official proponents of an initiative measure possess either a particularized interest in the initiative's validity or the authority to assert the State's interest in the initiative's validity, which would enable them to defend the constitutionality of the initiative upon its adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the initiative, when the public officials charged with that duty refuse to do so.</blockquote>If the court answers in the negative, the Ninth Circuit would likely dismiss the case, and it is unclear whether the August <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">invalidation</a> [JURIST report] of Proposition 8 by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] would stand. The parties disagree as to what effect a dismissal would have, and the circuit court noted the issue but did not address it. 

<p>When Judge Vaughn Walker of the Northern District of California struck down Proposition 8, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report], leaving defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Project Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law.

Through various detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." In addition, protesters contend that they were told to confess that they were trained by the Israeli or Iranian governments. AI's director for the Middle East and North Africa Malcolm Smart stated, "The Egyptian military authorities have committed publicly to creating a climate of freedom and democracy after so many years of state repression. Now they must match their words with direct and immediate action." Last week, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) published <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">similar concerns</a> [JURIST report], specifically about the detention of journalists, human rights activists, and protesters. UN <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has also called on Egyptian authorities to immediately <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-release-of-egypt-lawyers-journalists-activists.php">release lawyers, journalists and human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who have been arrested and suggested that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-egypt-protest-casualties.php">violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] has been planned. The AI report demands immediate disclosure of the names and whereabouts of all detainees, and for either official charges to be drawn against them, or their prompt release.

<p>Earlier this week the Supreme Council <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-appoints-judges-to-amend-constitution.php">appointed a panel of judges</a> [JURIST report] to amend Egypt's <A href = "http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolcon.htm">constitution</a> [text] prior to public referendum. This decision was part of the transition plan put in place by ousted president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile] before leaving office earlier this month. Last week the military pledged to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that have been in place since Mubarak assumed power. Prior to Mubarak's resignation, Egypt's government had <A href = "/paperchase/2011/02/joint-egypt-panel-to-study-constitutional-reform.php">reached out</a> [JURIST report] to various opposition leaders in the wake of demonstrations that swept the country. Among those in the opposition that have been approached are the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest and largest Islamic political group in the world. According to some commentators, the unrest in Egypt is closely related to the <a href = "/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">recent civil unrest in Tunisia</a> [JURIST op-ed] that culminated last month with the <A href = "/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">resignation of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Samantar, who has lived in the greater Washington, DC, area for more than 15 years, was sued in 2004 by two Somali men who alleged he spearheaded a campaign of ethnic repression against the northern Somali Isaaq clan during his tenure in office. Last June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] unanimously <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1555.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-foreign-officials-not-immune-from-suit.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1555">Samantar v.

The court remanded the case back to the Eastern District of Virginia, instructing the lower court to resolve questions of possible immunity under common law and other defenses.

<p>Respondents are seeking damages from Samantar under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350 text]. Samantar was minister of defense and later prime minister of Somalia from 1980 to 1990. Respondents claim that Samantar authorized torture and the extrajudicial killing of them and members of their family. The Isaaq clan, of which the respondents are members, was subjected to systematic persecution during Samantar's time in office before the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm">collapse of the Somali government in 1991</a> [DOS backgrounder].

US, British and German ambassadors to the UN <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/02/17/idINIndia-54949720110217">expressed reservations</a> [Reuters report] about establishing an <em>ad hoc</em> investigatory mechanism, as well as their support for the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) in conducting the inquiry. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, however, argued that EULEX is inadequately equipped to do so, as the allegations include activities throughout Europe and in Asia and Africa.

<p>The COE report alleges that Thaci was the leader of the KLA Drenica Group, a criminal network that controlled the heroin trade and the black market trafficking of kidneys of executed Serbian and Albanian war prisoners. News of the report's accusations prompted the government to <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,1782">respond</a> [press release], denying the allegations and calling them an attempt to harm Thaci's reputation following his party's victory in the nation's parliamentary elections last year. Claims of Kosovo's involvement in human organ trafficking originated in 2008 when former prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=del+ponte">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged in a book</a> [JURIST report] about her time at the tribunal that roughly 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of organ trafficking during the war. That year, Serbian prosecutors condemned Albania's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/albania-prosecutor-refuses-to.php">refusal to initiate</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo. Albanian Prosecutor General Ina Rama refused to cooperate with Serbian war crimes prosecutor <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Vladimir Vukcevic</a> [official website] and said that her country would only pursue the allegations if the ICTY decided to reopen its investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measures were set to expire on February 28. The provisions extended include roving wiretaps, "lone wolf" terrorism suspects and the government's ability to seize "any tangible items" in the course of surveillance. The brief extension has been viewed as a delay tactic to allow Congress to continue debate and hold hearings over the controversial counter-terrorism law. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/house-passes-three-month-patriot-act-extension">statement</a> [press release] critical of the House's decision, but urged Congress to use the additional time wisely:<blockquote>It is regrettable that this extension means living with a bad law for three more months, but the silver lining is an opportunity for Congress to focus fully on making necessary reforms to the Patriot Act. The intrusive and extensive power that this law grants our government has very real and serious effects on Americans' lives, and has been in place for far too long. Congress should use the next three months for the kind of vigorous debate Americans' privacy deserves.</blockquote>The bill will now be sent to President Barack Obama for his signature.

<p>The US <a href="http://senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/senate-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill on Tuesday by an 86-12 vote. Earlier in the week, a simple majority of the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/house-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">approved a similar bill</a> that would have extended the three provisions until December after it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/patriot-act-extension-fails-in-house.php">failed</a> [JURIST reports] the prior week under a special rule that required a two-thirds majority. Earlier this month, the Obama administration released a <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the provisions, but expressed support for the bill passed Monday. The provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended in February 2010</a> after the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> [JURIST reports] the Patriot Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/district/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website], names 12 defendants, including members of the FBI, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites]. Stanford alleges that the defendants used "abusive law-enforcement methods" to pursue a frivolous <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20901.pdf">civil suit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">report</a>] against him in order to gather evidence for his criminal prosecution. He also alleges that federal agents prevented him from mounting a proper defense by freezing his assets and then using $51 million of his own assets to fund the civil suit against him. Stanford is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-17/stanford-sues-u-s-prosecutors-sec-and-fbi-agents.html">seeking</a> [Bloomberg report] $7.2 billion in damages. 

<p>Stanford donated more than $2.3 million to lawmakers' campaigns and spent more than $5 million in lobbying efforts while allegedly carrying out the fraud. He has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him and was originally set to be released on $500,000 bail until prosecutors successfully appealed the decision. Through three of his investment companies, Stanford allegedly violated the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/33Act.htm">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/34Act.htm">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and the <a href="http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/uscode15-80a-1.htm">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [texts]. In January, a federal judge declared Stanford <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-deems-financier-stanford-incompetent-to-stand-trial.php">incompetent to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in connection with a $7 billion fraud scheme. Judge David Hittner of the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, who <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-orders-stanford-trial-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month, ordered Stanford to enter detoxification for an addiction to anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications prescribed to him by prison physicians that has rendered him unable to meaningfully contribute to his defense. A new trial date has yet to be scheduled, though Hittner advised lawyers for both sides to prepare themselves to proceed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Padilla alleged he was isolated and tortured while being detained on a Navy military brig in Charleston, South Carolina. US District Judge Richard Gerge ruled that the defendants, including US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] and former defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], are immune from suit, finding Padilla "failed to allege facts" sufficient to establish standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief and that allowing the trial to proceed further would cause a spectacle:<blockquote>A trial on the merits would be an international spectacle with Padilla, a convicted terrorist, summoning America's present and former leaders to a federal courthouse to answer his charges. This massive litigation would have been authorized not by a Congressionally established statutory cause of action, but by a court implying an action from the face of the American Constitution.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/blow-rule-law-court-dismisses-lawsuit-hold-former-government-officials-accountable">criticized the ruling</a> [press release], calling it "troubling" and a "blow to the rule of law" and demanding that the right to be free from torture be protected. 

<p>A federal judge in San Francisco reached the opposite conclusion in June 2009 when he <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss.php">allowed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-sues-law-professor-who-helped.php">lawsuit filed</a> [JURIST reports] by Padilla to move forward against University of California Berkeley <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">law professor John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>], the author of controversial US government memos arguing that detained enemy combatants could be denied Geneva Conventions protections against torture. The suit alleges that Yoo's memos, written while he was a senior lawyer in the US Justice Department, helped set the Bush administration's policy that terrorism detainees are not protected by the Geneva Conventions. Padilla was convicted and sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">17 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], along with Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifadh Wael Jayyousi, on charges of conspiracy to commit illegal violent acts outside the US, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and providing material support to terrorists.

Responding to a question from the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Forces Committee</a> [official website], Gates said that the odds of closing the detention facility are "very, very low," particularly because of congressional opposition, the difficulty in predicting which detainees are likely to return to terrorist activities and restrictions on detainees being brought to the US for trial under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.6523:">Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act of 2011</a> [HR 6523]. Gates made his comments one day after <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership/leon-e-panetta.html">CIA Director Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] told Congress that, if captured, <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive] and his second-in-command would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/16/AR2011021607294.html">probably be sent to Guantanamo Bay</a> [WP report]. At his first press briefing on Wednesday, <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Jay_Carney">Press Secretary Jay Carney</a> [WP profile] said that President Barack Obama still <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/16/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-2162011">aims to close Guantanamo</a> [briefing text], despite Panetta's comments.

<p>The Obama administration continues its push to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, despite running into several hurdles in closing the prison, including the suspension of detainee <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">transfers to Yemen</a> and a new law <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST reports] to the US for trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Thursday asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="http://aca-litigation.wikispaces.com/file/view/U.S.+motion+to+clarify.pdf">clarify his ruling</a> [motion, PDF] to require states to enact the <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] during the pendency of the government's appeal. In the motion, the government focused on the substantial uncertainty that would be faced by people who currently enjoy benefits from portions of the law that went into effect immediately. The motion also focused on the fact that the portion of the law ruled unconstitutional, the minimum coverage mandate, is not scheduled to go into effect until 2014, meaning there would be no prejudice to states if they would be required to enact the earlier-scheduled provisions. The government additionally noted the significant number of states, including those that are parties to this suit, have applied for funding under enacted portions of the law. The government concluded by focusing on Vinson's own words from the <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8DMNTD/$file/VinsonRuling1312011.pdf">grant of summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF]:<blockquote>The Court gave no indication, however, that it intended or anticipated the specific potential disruptions of ongoing programs and operations (discussed above) and the questions that would arise about which parties are bound by the Court's order while the appellate courts resolve constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act. And despite its clear recognition of the complexity of the [law] and the difficulty in determining how the reasoning of its declaratory judgment would affect existing programs, this Court expressly declined to grant "injunctive relief enjoining implementation of the Act."</blockquote>The DOJ also expressed its intent to appeal Vinson's ruling to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>Vinson <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the states' motion for summary judgment in January, finding that the minimum coverage mandate exceeded Congress' authority under the commerce clause. The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges and inconsistent rulings across the country. A Virginia appeals court is scheduled to hear challenges to two conflicting lower-court rulings in May&#8212;one upholding the legislation and the other invalidating part of it.

Pillay claimed that the Russian people do not trust government institutions, in part because of the ongoing harassment of journalists and human rights activists. She said that the "rule of law, including accountability and protection of rights for all citizens and non-citizens on Russian territory, is an essential prerequisite for true democracy, peace and development." Pillay met with Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] to discuss possible reforms and suggested that the success of the new <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2011/02/07/police-dok.html">Law on Police</a> [text, in Russian], which takes effect March 1 and <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100809/160124047.html">restricts the level of force</a> [RIA Novosti report] that police may use, will be a preview of future revisions to Russian law. During her visit, Pillay also met with human rights activists at a community center in Moscow and talked about the <a href="http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/18/44976584.html">growing role of public organizations</a> [Voice of Russia report] in the country.

<p>Russia faces ongoing criticism from the international community regarding its human rights record. In July, Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-president-signs-bill-expanding-secret-police-powers.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that granted controversial new powers to the Russian <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/fsb.htm">Federal Security Service</a> (FSB), the Russian Federation's successor to the former USSR's <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/kgb.htm">KGB</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders]. The bill, which the Russian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-upper-house-approves-bill-expanding-secret-police-powers.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month, gives the FSB authority to question citizens about actions that may create the conditions for a crime and <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5816106,00.html">issue warnings</a> [DW report] not to engage in unapproved acts. However, Russian courts have recently taken action against extremist groups in the country. A Russian court in July made public a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-bans-youtube-for-extremist-content.php">banning access to five websites</a> [JURIST report], including the video-sharing network <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> [website], for what it called extremist elements. Also in July, a Russian court sentenced 14 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=neo-nazi">neo-Nazis</a> [JURIST news archive], including a group leader and several teenagers, to jail terms for <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-jails-neo-nazis-for-hate-crimes.php">committing hate crimes against ethnic minorities</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Defreitas and co-conspirator Abdul Kadir, <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/doj-charges-4-in-alleged-jfk-airport.php">originally arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, were convicted by a federal jury in July on charges of conspiracy to attack a public transportation system, conspiracy to destroy a building by fire or explosive, conspiracy to attack aircraft and aircraft materials, conspiracy to destroy international airport facilities and conspiracy to attack a mass transportation facility. Kadir was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-sentences-jfk-airport-bomb-plotter-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] in December for his role in the plot. A third defendant, Abdel Nur, pleaded guilty in June for supporting the plot and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. A fourth co-conspirator, Kareem Ibrahim, awaits trial on the same charges as Defreitas and Kadir. US Attorney Loretta Lynch, said, "Russell Defreitas plotted to commit a terrorist attack that he hoped would rival 9/11. But law enforcement detected and thwarted the plot, saving lives. Now, our courts have dispensed justice by handing out the life sentence that Defreitas richly deserves." 

<p>According to the original <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2007/Defreitas.complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plot was intended to "cause greater destruction than in the Sept. 11 attacks," according to one of the suspects. The plot could have destroyed parts of New York's <a href="http://www.queensbp.org/">borough of Queens</a> [official website], where an underground fuel pipeline serving the airport runs. Defreitas, designer of the plot, sought to use his experience as a cargo handler for the airport to attack JFK's fuel tanks and pipelines. He recruited Kadir, Nur and Ibrahim during several trips he made to Guyana and Trinidad. Authorities tracked the plot for more than a year before making the arrests. Defreitas had said he formed the plot more than a decade ago, saying he chose the airport because its destruction would put "the whole country in mourning."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Members of the Ergenekon plot allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website]. Soner Yalcin, the owner of <a href="http://www.odatv.com/">Oda TV</a> [media website, in Turkish], an online news website that has been critical of the Turkish government, and two of his colleagues were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021800502.html">formally arrested</a> [AP report] following several days of interrogations.

US officials have <a href="http://turkey.usembassy.gov/statements_021611.html">voiced concerns</a> [statement] over the treatment of journalists in Turkey, while Turkish officials have warned other countries not to become involved in their domestic matters.

<p>In June, a Turkish criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 33 retired and active naval officers accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule as part of the Ergenekon plot. The Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-authorities-charge-33-for.php">indicted the 33 defendants</a> [JURIST report] in March on charges of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule. Also in March, Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-arrests-20-more-in.php">detained 20 people</a> in connection with the plot, and Turkish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon and plotting to overthrow the AKP.

Trials against the Ergenekon group <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">started</a> [JURIST report] two years ago and nearly 200 people have been charged in connection with it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban said that he is "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists." Ban went on to urge restraint:<blockquote>Here as elsewhere, violence should not be used against peaceful demonstrators and against journalists. It must stop. Those responsible must be brought to justice. Above all we have insisted on respect for the rights of peaceful protest and assembly, freedom of the press and access to information.  There should be no violence from any quarter. I urge all parties to exercise restraint.  The situation calls for bold reforms, not repression.</blockquote>In conjunction, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">condemned violence</a> [press release] by security forces in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen against anti-government demonstrators as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021803224.html">illegal and excessively heavy-handed</a> [WP report]. Pillay blamed the protests on decades of neglecting legitimate aspirations to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE71H1G320110218">realize civic, political, economic, social and cultural rights</a> [Reuters report]. Pillay also acknowledged that journalists, lawyers and activists <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1620369.php/UN-rights-chief-slams-heavy-handed-Middle-East-governments">seem to have been targeted for attack</a> [DPA report].

<p>Protests have swept across the Middle East and North Africa since protesters in Tunisia <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">ousted President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report] last month. On Monday, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci said the government will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-to-lift-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">end the 19-year-old state of emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] amidst growing protests in Algeria.

Ciavarella, a former judge in Pennsylvania's <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website], was implicated in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sentencing+scandal">juvenile sentencing scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] and accused of receiving kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which he had a financial interest. Ciavarella was charged with 39 counts of honest services fraud, racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud, bribery, extortion and tax evasion. He will remain free pending sentencing, and he is <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/defense-prosecution-declare-victory-in-ciavarella-conviction-1.1107461#axzz1EPumBZg2">expected to serve</a> [<em>Scranton Times-Tribune</em> report] between 13 to 15 years.

<p>The trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/former-pennsylvania-judge-goes-on-trial-over-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">began</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. In July, Judge Edwin Kosik <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.wbcitizensvoice.com/pdfs/conplea.pdf">plea agreement</a> [text, PDF] with former Pennsylvania judge Michael Conahan for his involvement in the juvenile sentencing scandal. Conahan now faces a 20-year prison sentence, a fine of up to $250,000 and disbarment. Kosik had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and Ciavarella, finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="paperchase/2011/02/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September 2009, following a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the guilty pleas they <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">entered</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mohammed admitted earlier this week to meetings with al Qaeda and acting as a weapons instructor and manager at the Khaden military camp in Afghanistan, where hijackers and other members of al Qaeda trained prior to the 9/11 attacks. Mohammed was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/pentagon-files-terrorism-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in May 2008 and has been detained at Guantanamo since his capture in Pakistan in 2002. As part of his plea agreement, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h8nfTQpIpXrN_IBCMW7NyRQCJt7Q?docId=CNG.0fa794225a1dc218031fb89f47003c8c.8e1">Mohammed promised to cooperate with US investigators</a> [AFP report] in ongoing investigations. If he does so, he will likely be released in advance of the 14 years to which he was sentenced.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">highlight what it claims are problems</a> [JURIST report] with the detention system currently used by the US for dealing with suspected terrorists. The detainee, Awal Gul, had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002, <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">suspected of having aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF]. Gul died of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises. The CCR believes that the circumstances surrounding Gul's death illustrate the inherent problem with the detention center and the policy the US follows in detaining and indefinitely holding suspected terrorists, claiming that the facility has become a purgatory, where people are held indefinitely. The issue of what to do with remaining detainees in US custody continues to be a significant issue. In January, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">Human Rights Watch criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Authorities were unable to serve an arrest <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-issues-arrest-warrant-for-former-president-musharraf-in-death-of-bhutto.php">warrant issued last Saturday</a> [JURIST report] because Musharraf is currently living in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/02/19/paskistan.musharraf.warrant/">self-imposed exile in London</a> [CNN report]. Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/">Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan</a> (FIA) [official website] Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali said the latest court order allows authorities to serve the new warrant at Musharraf's residences both in Pakistan and abroad. Musharraf's defense counsel, <a href="http://pakistanherald.com/Profile/Barrister-Muhammad-Ali-Saif-338">Muhammad Ali Saif</a> [<em>Pakistan Herald</em> profile], said that the charges were politically motivated and unwarranted. The court adjourned the hearing until March 5 to ensure Musharraf is present.

<p>Earlier this month, the court determined Musharraf had not cooperated during the investigation of Bhutto's death, and investigators have alleged that <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/02/13/warrants-issued-for-musharraf.html">Musharraf did not provide adequate security</a> [DAWN report] for Bhutto when she was assassinated during a campaign rally in Pakistan in 2007. According to an interim criminal charge sheet <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">issued earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] by the FIA, Musharraf appointed and allegedly gave orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto on the day she was assassinated. Specifically, the prosecution document alleges that Musharraf ordered the officers to remove a security detail for Bhutto prior to her departure and that he later ordered the same officers to hose down the scene of the assassination. The January <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">Salman Taseer assassination</a> [JURIST report] was the most high-profile assassination since <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">that of Bhutto in 2007</a> [JURIST report] and again involved issues of security. The Pakistani government and police forces have been criticized for their part in Bhutto's assassination. In April 2010, an independent UN commission formed to investigate the assassination issued a report holding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-commission-report-blames-pakistan.php">Pakistani government and police forces responsible</a> [JURIST report] for failing to provide adequate security. The report also accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into the assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Ricardo Urbina held that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mashour Abdullah Muqbel Alsabri was a part of and provided material support to the Taliban, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] or associated enemy forces. The court found that the petitioner traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban or al Qaeda, stayed at Taliban or al Qaeda guesthouses, received military training at an al Qaeda facility, traveled to the battle lines and was captured during armed conflict. Furthermore, the court found no evidence that the petitioner dissociated with these enemy forces at any point prior to his capture. These findings taken together, the court said, support the government's contention that the petitioner was lawfully detained. The petitioner was arrested in 2002 and filed his <em>habeas corpus</em> petition in October 2006.

<p>Federal courts have struggled with <em>habeas corpus</em> rights for Guantanamo detainees. In September, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=odah">Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Al-Odah-cert-petition-9-28-10.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201007/09-5331-1253722.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">report</a>] <em>habeas corpus</em> relief to al Odah in July. The court affirmed the district court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-639">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-denies-al-odah-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that there was sufficient evidence against al Odah for him to be considered "part of" al Qaeda and Taliban forces.

In the ruling, Marende found that Kibaki's nominees to the positions of chief justice, attorney general, director of public prosecutions and controller of budget had violated Article 29(2) of the constitution, which states: "when this Constitution requires an appointment to be made by the President with the approval of the National Assembly, until after the first elections under this Constitution, the President shall, subject to the National Accord and Reconciliation Act, appoint a person after consultation with the Prime Minister and with the approval of the National Assembly." <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/east/-Kenyan-President-PM-to-Rethink-Judicial-Appointees--116477228.html">has disputed the nominations</a> [VOA report], which were made while he was in Ethiopia. Odinga had asked Kibaki to wait for his return to Kenya before making the nominations. After finding that he could rule on the issue, Marende held:<blockquote>I find and rule that the constitutional requirements of ... consultation subject to the National Accord and Reconciliation Act are not met if the National Assembly receives a list of nominees to constitutional offices, on which there is open and express disagreement between His Excellency, the President and the Prime Minister. Such is not the nomination contemplated by the National Accord and Reconciliation Act, which is part of the Constitution. It is unconstitutional and the unconstitutionality cannot be cured by any act of this House or of its Committees nor by a vote on a Motion in the House. Further, and I so find, no Motion on such a nomination, whatever its terms and whatever the contents of the Report upon which the Motion is based, is admissible and I therefore hereby so order.</blockquote>Following the ruling, Kibaki argued that <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=68992">Marende's ruling violated the separation of powers</a> [KBC report], and that the issue should have been left for the courts to decide. Kibaki also insisted that his nominations were made pursuant to the constitution.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/index.php">High Court of Nairobi</a> [official website] ruled that the nominations were unconstitutional because they <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kenya-high-court-rules-judicial-appointments-unconstitutional.php">violated promises of gender equality</a> [JURIST report]. Justice Daniel Musinga found that Kibaki's appointments violated Article 27(3) of the constitution, which states, "[w]omen and men have the right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres." Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">ratified its new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in August, as part of a reform movement aimed at curbing vast presidential powers. Kenya's new constitution includes numerous checks on presidential authority, among which are the creation of a supreme court and senate. The new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">approved by popular referendum</a> [JURIST report], which took place amid concerns that high turnout and heated debate over the referendum could cause a repeat of the violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election">2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] that resulted in Kenya's current power sharing agreement between Kibaki and Odinga. The government is now expected to start implementing the new constitution, which could take as long as five years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Calling himself the "most persecuted man in the history of the justice system," in a <a href = "http://www.promotoridellaliberta.it/index.php/manifesto-blog/448-per-una-giustizia-giusta-e-degna-di-un-paese-moderno">released audio statement</a> [audio statement and transcript, in Italian] and an unreleased <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110219/wl_nm/us_italy_berlusconi">conference call</a> [Reuters report], Berlusconi outlined several improvements he plans to make in Italy, including reshaping the judiciary branch. He cited, in particular, the <a href = "http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian], which <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] parts of a <a href = "http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">law</a> [materials, in Italian] Berlusconi backed that would grant public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office.<blockquote>As for future agenda, I summon the Council of Ministers to launch ... [a] special session on constitutional reform ... to ensure that Italy may finally have a fair justice and also a justice worthy of a modern country, that without those injustices, those delays and the inefficiencies that have discouraged foreign investors for years even to come to work with us. There are inequities, inefficiencies and delays ... which has increasingly become a political counter [that] overflows from the constitutional principles and that is always less efficient [rather than] just a public service, which, instead everyone would like it to be.</blockquote>In the conference call, Berlusconi revealed proposals that include, "a two-thirds majority on the 15-member court will be required to repeal a law." Opposition leaders declared this a sign of desperation.

<p>Earlier this week, Berlusconi was the <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/14/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSTRE71D1YN20110214">subject of protests</a> [Reuters] by hundreds of thousands of women, calling for his resignation over his recent sex scandal. In January, hundreds of Italy's judges <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process, which would have allowed charges against Berlusconi to lapse. Italian prosecutors launched a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/prosecutors-launch-tax-inquiry-against-italy-pm-berlusconi.php">tax inquiry</a> [JURIST report] against Berlusconi in October for tax declarations he made in 2003 and 2004 relating to the commercial broadcast company <a href = "http://www.mediaset.it/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian], which Berlusconi founded. The investigation is the fourth time Berlusconi has faced allegations of fraud in relation to his Mediaset company. In addition to the trial for abuse of power and underage prostitution, Berlusconi has three other pending judicial proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sponsored by <a href="http://www.utah.gov/house/detail.html?i=SANDSSE">Representative Stephen Sandstrom</a> (R) [official profile], the controversial <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillamd/hb0070.pdf">bill</a> [HB 70 text, PDF] had been <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51269040-75/amendment-bill-enforcement-federal.html.csp">amended several times</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] before going up for a vote. The proposed law will give state law enforcement officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of those they stop or arrest, but under the approved amendments, only for serious crimes. A controversial provision to the bill, which allowed police officers to inquire about a person's immigration status while being stopped or arrested for a misdemeanor, was <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillamd/hb0070.amdx.pdf">changed</a> [HB 70 Amended, PDF] last week. Unlike its Arizona predecessor, the Utah immigration bill does not provide an avenue for private citizens to sue local police who do not enforce the law. The House did <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/pamend/hb0070.hfaf.06.pdf">not pass a proposed amendment</a> [materials, PDF] that would allow illegal aliens "being held for transportation" to remain in the state "if a legal resident of this state offers to sponsor the alien in compliance with the requirements under federal law." The bill will now head to the state <a href="http://www.utahsenate.org/">Senate</a> [official website] where uncertainty remains as to whether it will pass and be signed into law. 

<p>The issue of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] has been the subject of legislation and lawsuits across the country, and several states have <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST reports] similar to the controversial Arizona <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">immigration law</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Arizona law, which has been widely criticized as unconstitutional for allegedly legalizing racial profiling, has sparked a nationwide debate on immigration policy, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">prompting calls for immigration reform</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile].

Iranian security forces reportedly took control of the area outside of Karroubi's residence and barred all family members, except his wife, from entering.

The court found that Mutware <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12523847">ordered his troops</a> [BBC report] to rape, assault and loot from residents of Fizi. Eight of his troops were also <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE71K31420110221">given prison sentences</a> [Reuters report] of between 10 and 20 years and expelled from the army for their involvement in the attack.

The court also upheld the acquittals of two Indian citizens accused as accomplices because of insufficient evidence.The court said in its 1,208-page decision that the only mitigating factor was Kasab's age, 24, but that it was overridden by the grave nature of the crime:<blockquote>The brutality, perversity and cruelty exhibited by [Kasab] by committing multiple murders of innocent men, women, children, aged persons and policemen without provocation for a motive which has no moral justification makes this case a gravest case of extreme culpability. The conduct of [Kasab] shows that his mental age overrides his physical age. He has never shown any repentance, but has loudly proclaimed that he wants to [set an example] by his conduct.</blockquote>After the announcement of the judgment, people <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mumbai-terror-20110222,0,1101592.story?track=rss">cheered in the street</a> [LAT report], lighting fireworks and chanting for Kasab's death. Kasab can still appeal to India's highest court, and, if that is unsuccessful, he can petition the government for clemency. Kasab will likely be hanged, but the appeals could delay his execution for years.

<p>Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/convicted-mumbai-gunman-appeals-death-sentence.php">filed his appeal</a> in June after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-convicts-mumbai.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] in May for his role in the attack, which was allegedly coordinated by Pakistani militant group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder]. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-sentences-mumbai-gunman-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> after the prosecution <a href="/2010/05/india-prosecutors-seeking-death-penalty-in-mumbai-terror-trial.php">sought the death penalty</a> [JURIST reports], citing eight aggravating circumstances. Judge ML Tahiliyani, specially appointed in January 2009 to preside over the trial of the three suspects detained after the attacks, heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-court-hears-final-arguments-in.php">closing arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case last March. In January 2010, Tahiliyani <a href="g/paperchase/2010/01/india-court-rejects-mumbai-terror.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Kasab's request for an international trial after Kasab claimed that he would not receive a fair trial in India. In December 2009, Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-withdraws.php">withdrew his confession</a> [JURIST report], claiming he was tortured and framed by police. Tahiliyani <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">continued the trial</a> [JURIST report] despite Kasab's confession, ruling that it was incomplete but should be entered into the record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the address, Saif al-Islam also called for an end to the protests, warning of instability, civil war and thousands of deaths if they are continued. The protests began Tuesday following those that had occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of Tunisian president <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and Egyptian president <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports]. Protesters have demanded Gaddafi's resignation and government reform since the start of protests in Benghazi, Libya's second city, which was reported to be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5h2mFFCS92VgjTqXUGARn6P3qr-5g?docId=N0069281298277647024A">largely under the control of demonstrators</a> [UKPA report] following the retreat of police and military forces and reported defections by military personnel over the weekend. Also on Monday, protests were reported to have <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201122131439291589.html">spread into the capital city of Tripoli</a> [Al Jazeera report], as several large tribes have expressed support for the protests and have threatened to cut off oil exports if Gaddafi, who has been in power since a 1969 coup, fails to step down. Following these developments, Libyan Justice Minister Mustafa Mohamed Abud Al Jeleil <a href="http://quryna.com/30563.html">resigned</a> [Quryna report] Monday, citing the government's violent response to the demonstrations. Al Jeleil is the fourth government official to resign since the start of the protests, following those of the ambassadors to India, China and the Arab League. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported Sunday that <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/02/20/libya-governments-should-demand-end-unlawful-killings">more than 230 protesters had been killed</a> [press release] since Tuesday, with the military and government supporters using live ammunition and machine guns on protesters, a shutdown of the Internet and the arrest of those who speak to foreign press. 

<p>On Thursday, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">called for an end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in Bahrain and elsewhere, referencing recent attempts to quell protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa. Ban said that he is "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists." In conjunction, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], on Friday condemned violence by the security forces in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen against anti-government demonstrators as illegal and excessively heavy-handed. Pillay blamed the protests on decades of neglecting legitimate aspirations to realize civic, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Last week, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci said the government will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-to-lift-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">end the 19-year-old state of emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] amidst growing protests in Algeria. Earlier this month, Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/iran-opposition-leader-under-house-arrest-after-calling-for-egypt-style-protests.php">placed under house arrest</a> [JURIST report] in relation to calls by Karroubi and fellow opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mir-Hossein+Mousavi">Mir Hossein Mousavi</a> [JURIST news archive] for rallies in support of the recent political reform movements in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the government has not stated an intention to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, Woolf has warned that continued adherence to the convention combined with the creation of a British Bill of Rights will create complications for judges in determining which to follow and further the existing conflict between the UK and the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. The proposal for the British convention <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12522239">arose from recent disagreements</a> [BBC report] with both the ECHR and the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/index.html">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The former caused outrage by <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/british-prisoners-may-be-given-right.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that prisoners should have the right to vote and the latter evoked a similar reaction through its April 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/uk-supreme-court-rules-sex-offenders.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the country's sex offender registry violates individual rights to privacy. In his <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110216/debtext/110216-0001.htm#11021651000010">answers to questions</a> [text] regarding these issues last week, Prime Minister David Cameron characterized the Supreme Court's ruling as flying "in the face of common sense" and assured those listening that "a commission will be established imminently to look at a British Bill of Rights, because it is about time we ensured that decisions are made in this Parliament rather than in the courts." For now, Cameron intends to follow the minimum requirements of each respective ruling.

<p>Earlier this month, UK think tank <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/">Policy Exchange</a> [think tank website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-urged-to-withdraw-from-europe-rights-court.php">called for the UK to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the ECHR in favor of a domestic high court. Senior UK judge Lord Leonard Hoffman wrote the foreword, saying the "Strasbourg court has taken upon itself an extraordinary power to micromanage the legal systems of the member states." The report, written by former government adviser Dr. Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, explains that the ECHR has gradually grown in power. It calls for the UK to try to negotiate reforms with the court to limit its jurisdiction, and, if unsuccessful, states "the UK should consider withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and establishing the Supreme Court in London as the final appellate court for human rights law." The report suggests that, if the UK pulls out, a domestic court would be final arbiter on human rights issues, and there would be no right to appeal to the ECHR. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mozilo is most identified with taking part in the mortgage boom that caused financial devastation to banking institutions and private homeowners. In 2009, the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/sec-charges-former-countrywide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Mozilo, along with several other company officials, with securities fraud arising from misleading investors. The SEC alleged that the officials falsely assured investors about credit risks involved in the company's efforts to build and maintain their market share, and that they knew the company was issuing risky loans and that defaults and delinquencies would arise as a result. Mozilo was also charged with insider trading for selling his stock in the company based on inside information. Although the Mozilo probe has been dropped, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mozilo-20110219,0,3665171.story">future investigations may arise</a> [LAT report] from developments in the civil cases against Mozilo from Countrywide shareholders.  

<p>Recently, there have been several settlements resulting from the lawsuits against Countrywide for its role in the mortgage crisis. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/">Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles</a> [official website] <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n2031_settlement.pdf">approved</a> [opinion, PDF] a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/california-countrywide-settle-predatory-lending-charges-for-65-million.php">$6.5 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the state of California and two former Countrywide Financial Corporation executives, including Mozilo, accused of predatory lending. In June, Countrywide, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bank-of-america-subsidiary-reaches-108-million-settlement-with-ftc.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823205/100607countrywideorder.pdf">$108 million settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] in response to a lawsuit that charged it with collecting excessive fees from homeowners facing foreclosure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pratibha Devisingh Patil</a> [official website] announced Monday that the government will work to eradicate corruption. In her address to both houses of <a href="http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/">Parliament</a> [official website] to open the budget session, Patil stated that India will take measures to ratify the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf">UN Convention Against Corruption</a> [text, PDF] and that it will take other legislative and administrative measures necessary to improve transparency. The government has also set up a group of ministers charged with <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Corruption-and-inflation-top-govt-priorities--says-President/752950">streamlining the judicial system</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report]. They will particularly work to expedite corruption cases brought against civil servants suspected of corruption and to amend current laws to facilitate bringing claims against public servants. Partial public funding of elections is also being considered as a method to improve transparency. 

<p>In 2008, <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-pm-backs-special-courts-for.php">establishment of special courts</a> [JURIST report] to deal only with corruption charges, telling a convention of high-ranking justices and government ministers that, "apart from pendency and delayed justice, corruption is another challenge we face both in government and the judiciary." Singh said addressing these problems would increases both domestic and foreign confidence in the court system. Following the prime minister's remarks, <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/sitting/bkgopinathan.htm">Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan</a> [official profile] told reporters that Singh did not mean that the judiciary itself was corrupt, but rather that it has to deal with a large number of cases brought by the <a href="http://www.cbi.gov.in/">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> [official website], which alleged government corruption. Balakrishnan went on to say that allegations of judicial corruption were rare and dealt with swiftly when they did arise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ICTY prosecutors say that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/22/AR2011022201633.html">Seselj divulged the names</a> [AP report] in a book he wrote and on his <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/">website</a> [personal website, in Serbian]. Seselj, a former president of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6296601.stm">Serbian Radical Party</a> (SRS) [BBC backgrounder] claims that the witnesses gave him permission to reveal their names and that they had been coerced into testifying against him. Last August, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icty-orders-independent-investigation-of-witness-intimidation-at-seselj-trial.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether prosecutors had intimidated witnesses into testifying against Seselj in a war crimes trial. The presiding judge in Seselj's contempt case has agreed to adjourn the trial after the prosecution states its case to give Seselj time to bring witnesses to The Hague.

<p>Last May, the ICTY appeals division <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-upholds-contempt-conviction-of-serb-nationalist-leader.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">2009 contempt verdict</a> [JURIST reports] against Seselj for revealing the identities of other witnesses that were supposed to remain confidential. Seselj's war crimes trial <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/icty-resumes-seselj-trial-after-delay.php">resumed in early 2010</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">being delayed</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly a year over fears that witnesses were being intimidated. He is charged with 14 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. The ICTY had previously <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/serb-nationalist-war-crimes-defendant_27.php">stripped Seselj of his right to defend himself</a> after he failed to appear in court, despite an earlier appeals court ruling that he could <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/icty-appeals-panel-rules-serb.php">represent himself</a> [JURIST reports] provided he did not engage in courtroom behavior that "substantially obstruct[ed] the proper and expeditious proceedings in his case." Seselj is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wyeth</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-vaccine-lawsuits.php">report</a>] that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/300aa-22.html">section 22(b)(1)</a> [text] of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 provides blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers from all tort actions filed in state or federal court alleging design defects. The issue in this case arises from the text of the section itself, which expressly preempts certain design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers "if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings." Petitioners argued that their suit, alleging poor design, should not be preempted, as the side effects were avoidable. However, the court affirmed the ruling of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073794p.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that section 22(b)(1) preempts all vaccine design defect claims, regardless of whether the vaccine's side effects were avoidable. Relying on textual interpretation and the ultimate purpose of the act, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority:<blockquote>The "even though" clause clarifies the word that precedes it. It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine manufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be considered "unavoidable" under the statute. Provided that there was proper manufacture and warning, any remaining side effects, including those resulting from design defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law design-defect claims are therefore preempted.</blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer, concurring with the majority, recognized the validity of its textual argument but called its reliance on the textual question alone a "close one" and emphasized the use of other sources including legislative history, statutory purpose and the views of the federal administrative agency to reinforce the court's conclusion. In contrast, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissenting opinion joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, interpreted the text quite differently and referenced other uses of similarly worded clauses within the act to reinforce her view that the "even though" clause sets forth a condition, which in this case has not been met, to invoke section 22(b)(1)'s defense to tort liability. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in deciding the case.

<p>This is one of many court cases that have stemmed from the use of vaccines. In September, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">affirmed</a> a decision issued last year by the US Court of Federal Claims <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/federal-court-rejects-cases-linking.php">finding insufficient evidence</a> [JURIST reports] to establish a link between childhood vaccines and autism in three test cases. The decision focused on the case of 15-year-old Michelle Cedillo, who received the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002026.htm">MMR vaccine</a> [NIH backgrounder] when she was 15 months old and was subsequently diagnosed with autism and various gastrointestinal disorders. Michelle's parents alleged that <a href="http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm096228.htm">Thimerosal</a> [FDA backgrounder], the mercury-based preservative found in Michelle's MMR vaccine, damaged her immune system, rendering her unable to defend against the measles virus contained in the vaccine, which spread throughout her body and caused her current problems. The family sought compensation under the no-fault <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> [HRSA backgrounder]. The court found petitioners were unable to establish that the MMR vaccine was a substantial factor in bringing about Michelle's injuries and that the lower court did not err in placing this burden on petitioners. The court also affirmed the lower court's finding that the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] experts proved petitioners' laboratory results establishing the connection between the vaccines and illnesses were "severely flawed." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Alabama Department of Revenue</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a railroad may challenge sales and use taxes that apply to rail carriers but exempt their competitors in the transportation industry. Railroads pay a 4 percent sales tax and a 4 percent use tax to the state of Alabama when they purchase or consume diesel fuel. Interstate motor and water carriers&#8212;the primary competitors of railroad carriers&#8212;are exempt from paying these taxes.The petitioners, CSX Transportation, argued that the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/45C17.txt">Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976</a> (4-R Act) [text] restricts the ability of state and local governments to levy discriminatory taxes on rail carriers. The respondents argued that the court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-74.ZS.html">Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc.</a> [materials] to uphold a property tax exemption, as well as principles of federalism, should lead the court to find in the respondents' favor. In an opinion authored by Justice Elena Kagan, the court disagreed, holding that tax exemptions are often discriminatory:<blockquote>[T]ax exemptions are an obvious form of tax discrimination. ... It is hardly self-evident why Congress would prohibit a State from charging a railroad a 4% tax and a competitor a 2% tax, but allow the State to charge the railroad a 4% tax and the competitor nothing. The latter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act even more than the former.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, arguing that CSX Transportation would not be able to prove that the tax exemption discriminates against railroad carriers.  The court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether the taxes in fact discriminate against railroad carriers.

<p>At <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-considers-railroad-tax-gender-discrimination-cases.php">oral argument</a> [JURIST report], the justices attempted to determine when a tax exemption amounts to "discrimination" within the meaning of the 4-R Act. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the narrow question of whether a tax exemption could ever amount to discrimination does not require a discussion of formulating some basis for determining whether the particular tax exemption is in fact discriminatory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay cited the use of machine guns, snipers and military planes against protesters, calling for an independent investigation. She also urged an immediate end to the serious human rights violations, denouncing the "callousness" of the Gaddafi government:<blockquote>The state has an obligation to protect the rights to life, liberty and security. ... Protection of civilians should always be the paramount consideration in maintaining order and the rule of law. The authorities should immediately cease such illegal acts of violence against demonstrators. Widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population may amount to crimes against humanity.</blockquote>Pillay indicated support for efforts led by the UK to call an emergency session of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Libya, but the decision rests with the UNHRC, of which Libya is a member.

<p>The situation in Libya has escalated over days of continued protests and violent suppression by security forces. On Monday, Saif al-Islam, son of Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], announced in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piEslrLNSoQ">televised address</a> [video] following several days of protests that the Libyan government is <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">considering adopting a constitution</a> [JURIST report] and allowing greater freedoms. The protests began last week following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports].

Carol Anne Bond was charged with burning her husband's mistress using poisonous chemicals and was indicted under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000229----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &#167; 229(a) text] created to stop the distribution and use of chemical weapons under the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dda/WMD/cwc/">1993 Chemical Weapons Convention</a> [UN backgrounder]. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/082677p.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Bond lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the basis of the Tenth Amendment because she was an individual acting on her own and not with a state. Counsel for the government said that it would be unfair if Bond raised a Tenth Amendment argument that the federal government overstepped its power and violated a state's ability to make its own law, because the state would not be a party to the case and unable to represent its own interests. Counsel for Bond argued that she has standing to challenge the federal law because the "liberty interest she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third party's," such as the state's.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1498.pdf">United States v. Tinklenberg</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether time taken to process a pretrial motion is excluded from the maximum 70-day deadline allowed under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003161----000-.html">Speedy Trial Act of 1974</a> [18 USC &#167; 3161(h)(1)(D) text], or whether the time is excluded only if the pretrial motion postpones, or is expected to postpone, the trial. Jason Louis Tinklenberg was convicted of making methamphetamine and appealed his conviction arguing that his trial started after the deadline required by federal statute. The US Court of the Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0323p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Tinklenberg's indictment should have been dismissed because the postponed date of the trial violated the Speedy Trial Act. Counsel for the government argued that the court should uphold precedent, saying that "[f]or more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule." Counsel for Tinklenberg argued that the court should use the "ordinary meaning" of the language in the statute, finding that the trial was delayed unlawfully. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The OCSLA governs those who work on oil drilling platforms and other fixed structures beyond state maritime boundaries, and workers are eligible for compensation for "any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf." Juan Valladolid worked for Pacific Operations Offshore, stationed primarily on an offshore drilling platform, but was killed on the grounds of Pacific Operations' onshore oil processing facility when he was crushed by a forklift. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/05/13/08-73862.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] "that the OCSLA workers' compensation provision ... applies to any injury resulting from operations on the outer continental shelf, regardless of the location of the injury. An injury is 'the result of' outer continental shelf operations if there is a substantial nexus between the injury and the operations." There is a circuit split on this issue.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-514.htm">Stok &#38; Associates v.

Stok &#38; Associates filed suit against Citibank, which sought to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in their contract. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.eapdlaw.com/files/upload/citibank_v_stok-assoc_1.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that Citibank had not waived its right to arbitration.

The draft ordinance will have the force of law upon publication in the <a href = "http://www.joradp.dz/HEN/Index.htm">Official Journal of Algeria</a> [official website], which the Council of Ministers said would be "imminent." The state of emergency, which has been in place since a <a href = "http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1504_1217250248_decret-presidentiel-no-92-44-du-9-fevrier-1992-portant-instauration-de-l-etat-d-urgence.pdf">series of decrees</a> [92-44, <a href = "http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1504_1217249985_decret-executif-no-92-75-du-20-fevrier-1992-fixant-les-conditions-d-application-de-certaines-dispositions-du-decret-presidentiel-no-92-44-portant-instauration-de-l-etat-d-urgence.pdf">92-75</a>, <a href = "http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1504_1217249660_decret-presidentiel-no-92-320-du-11-aout-1992-portant-sur-l-instauration-de-l-etat-d-urgence.pdf">92-320</a>, PDF; in French] in 1992, gave the government power to limit political freedoms and even peaceful protests. Opponents also claimed that the state of emergency gave rise to arbitrary detentions.  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika <A href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJC5cqzuHSA6A52-HB86VLAyvtbA?docId=CNG.155b621fd0222d640f22c8ee8ab21457.d41">announced earlier in the month</a> [AFP report] that the order would be lifted and maintained that protests have not been discouraged: "[n]o law or order has ever forbidden any legal formation or association." However, he declared the state capital of Algiers would remain off-limits to protests. Anti-government protests began in January, in defiance of the state of emergency's stipulations, with the <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201121943659150329.html">most recent protests on Saturday in Algiers</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The protests in the city capital were met by riot police, although no violence was reported.

<p>Algeria has been under a state of emergency since 1992 when the military <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021401386.html">canceled elections</a> [WP report] fearing a win by religious fundamentalists. The state of emergency was <a href = "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm">declared</a> [DOS backgrounder] after it became apparent that the militant Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would win control of the government. Bouteflika came to power, winning the presidency in 1999 with 70 percent of the official vote and appearing to have the backing of the military. He and the Council of Ministers' willingness to appease protesters appears connected to the protests that have swept across the Middle East and North Africa since protesters in Tunisia <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">ousted President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report] last month. Saif al-Islam, son of Libyan leader <A href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">announced in a televised address</a> [JURIST report] following several days of protests that the Libyan government is considering adopting a constitution and allowing greater freedoms. Earlier this month, <A href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">announced his resignation</a> [JURIST report] amid unrelenting protests across Egypt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/49359380/Judge-Kessler-Health-Care-Reform-Is-Constitutional">ruled</a> [opinion] Tuesday that Congress acted within its constitutional powers in passing the <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] and that the law does not violate the religious freedom of plaintiffs who challenged the law. Judge Gladys Kessler dismissed the suit filed by the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> [advocacy website] on behalf five individuals, three of whom refuse to use medicine, arguing that doing so indicates a lack of trust in God, and two of whom believe in holistic medicine that they contend will not be covered by insurance. Kessler found that Congress had the power to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), including the requirement that all individuals purchase insurance, under the Constitution's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] which gives Congress broad powers to regulate economic activity. She then found that the individual mandate does not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_21B.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 2000bb text], which generally prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion, even through laws of general applicability, absent a compelling government interest. Since the PPACA allows individuals to make a payment in lieu of coverage and the individual mandate is essential to the PPACA, "the Court conclude[d] that (1) [the individual mandate] does not place a substantial burden on the exercise of Plaintiffs' Christian faith, and (2), even assuming that it does, it is the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest."

<p>The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges and inconsistent rulings across the country. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the PPACA</a> [JURIST report] as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a>. A Virginia appeals court is scheduled to hear challenges to two conflicting lower-court rulings in May&#8212;one upholding the legislation and the other invalidating part of it. In December, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruled that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but left the remainder of the law intact. Earlier that month, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-10245.pdf">Freeman v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court will determine whether <a href="http://law.justia.com/us/codes/title18/18usc3582.html">18 USC &#167; 3582(c)(2)</a> [text] permits adjustment of a sentence when a defendant pleads guilty and <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/CR2009.pdf">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C)</a> (FRCP) [text, PDF] applies. The defendant, William Freeman, pleaded guilty to drug and firearms offenses and was sentenced to 106 months in prison pursuant to a plea agreement. The district court accepted that agreement, and, pursuant to FRCP 11(c)(1)(C), that sentence followed federal sentencing guidelines and was binding on the court. The US Sentencing Commission later lowered the level for crack cocaine sentencing, and Freeman moved for a sentence reduction. Freeman's attorney argued that the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's refusal to adjust, misread the statute and Congressional intent. Particularly, counsel for petitioner argued that FRCP 11(c)(1)(C) had been in effect for 10 years when &#167; 3582(c)(2) was passed, and Congress did not include an exception for pleas made pursuant to the rule. The government argued that adjustment pursuant to &#167; 3582(c)(2) is permissible only when the sentence is based on a sentencing guideline that is subsequently lowered, and as Freeman agreed to a sentence, as opposed to having one imposed through a guilty verdict, he does not meet the requirements for reduction. In one exchange, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that the government seems to construe "based on" as "absolutely determined by" and stated, "the guidelines form part of the the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision is not based on the guidelines" to which the government's attorney responded that the proper test is whether the guidelines were of legal consequence in the determination to accept the plea.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-6.pdf">Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB, SA</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>], the court will determine whether the state of mind necessary for for a finding of inducing patent infringement is "deliberate indifference of a known risk" as elucidated by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct", as stated by the court in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2004/2004_04_480">MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.</a> [Oyez backgrounder]. Under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_271.htm">35 USC &#167; 271(b)</a> [text], a patent owner may bring suit against an individual "who actively induces infringement of a patent." The petitioners stood accused of inducing infringement of a patented deep fryer produced by SEB. The trial court allowed the issue to go to the jury, denying petitioners' motion to dismiss, at the conclusion of the presentation of evidence even though petitioners had no knowledge of SEB's patent. The Federal Circuit affirmed, using the "deliberate indifference to a known risk" standard. Counsel for petitioners argued that that the Supreme Court has already announced the necessary state of mind in <span class="casename">Grokster</span> and that active inducement requires purposeful conduct. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, challenging counsel for the petitioners, noted that the infringement opinion, which petitioners sought and relied on heavily in their argument, was not well-informed, stating, "[b]ut [they] didn't tell that patent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a particular product. If the attorney had been told this device copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths percent sure that the attorney then would have found this patent?" Scalia quickly followed up, focusing on why petitioners did not tell the infringement opinion attorney about their reverse-engineering of the SEB product. Petitioner's counsel answered that, "their practice was not to notify the attorney." Counsel for SEB argued that actual knowledge of the patent would be an appropriate standard for finding inducement, provided that "willful blindness" be accepted as a means of proving actual knowledge, even though neither "knowing" nor "knowledge" appear in that portion of the statute.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Wednesday that it will <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [press release] of Section 3 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] acknowledged that the announcement marks a change in policy for the DOJ and the Obama administration, but noted that the change was necessary due to cases pending in the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website]. Holder explained that when the DOJ previously defended DOMA it had done so in jurisdictions with binding precedent stating that a permissive standard of review was applicable to laws dealing with sexual orientation. Holder indicated that both he and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] believe that laws concerning sexual orientation should be subject to a higher standard of review and that DOMA is unconstitutional when considered under that standard, stating:<blockquote>After careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.</blockquote>In addition to declining to defend DOMA, Holder indicated that DOJ attorneys will advise courts with pending DOMA litigation that they believe that DOMA should be subjected to a heightened level of scrutiny. Holder also emphasized that Section 3 of DOMA does remain in effect and that the Executive Branch will continue enforcing the law, even though they believe it is unconstitutional. 

<p>Last month, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">July ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. In its brief, the DOJ argued that DOMA is in line with those sections of the constitution, stating that DOMA was "rationally related" to maintaining "consistency in the distribution of federal marriage-based benefits." Massachusetts, the first state to recognize gay marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/massachusetts-ag-challenges-defense-of.php">initiated the suit</a> [JURIST report] against the federal government in July 2009. In November, the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders</a> (GLAD) and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-grous-file-lawsuits-challenging-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed separate lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging DOMA. Plaintiffs in the GLAD case allege that they have been denied certain marriage benefits and protections that are available to similarly situation heterosexual couples in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. The plaintiff in the ACLU case is challenging provisions of DOMA that deprive of her certain tax deductions she would receive as a widow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mazda Motors of America</a> [docket], finding that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00030103----000-.html">federal minimum safety standard</a> [text] does not preempt state tort actions. The court held that compliance with <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/fmvss/index.html#SN208">Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208</a> [text], which requires automobile manufacturers to install lap and shoulder seat belt assemblies only for a vehicle's outboard seating and permits lap-only seat belts at the inboard seating, does not bar a state tort action alleging that the manufacturer should have installed lap and shoulder restraints in the latter seating positions. Writing for the unanimous court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the regulations represent minimum standards and that they do not exempt manufacturers from liability:<blockquote>The more important reason why [the US Department of Transportation] did not require lap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats was that it thought that this requirement would not be cost-effective. ... But that fact - the fact that DOT made a negative judgment about cost effectiveness - cannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common law tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a different conclusion.</blockquote>Per the court, preemption would only have been proper had the "significant objective" of the regulation been to provide manufacturers with a choice between seat belt types.

<p>The court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1314.pdf">arguments</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-takes-up-arizona-school-tuition-case.php">report</a>] on the matter in November, during which time counsel for the petitioners, joined by the US government as <em>amicus curiae</em>, argued that "[t]he claim is not preempted, because it is perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208 governing Type 2 seat belts in rear seats." The petitioners also claimed that <a href="http://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a> [corporate website] had a duty to warn of safety risks associated with lap-only seat belts under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/06-1249P.ZS">Wyeth v. Levine</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-rules-state-law-not.php">report</a>], in which the Supreme Court ruled that federal approval of labels giving warnings about effects of drugs does not bar lawsuits under state law claiming inadequate warnings of a health risk. Counsel for respondents countered that the claim should be preempted because the federal government did not merely provide a minimum standard, but left the option to the manufacturer because of safety trade-offs for each type of seat belt. The court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/08-1314_pet1.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [cert. petition, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-five-cases.php">report</a>] in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo noted that the ICC lacks the authority to intervene until Libya accepts the court's jurisdiction or the UN refers the situation to the ICC, stating: <blockquote>The decision to do justice in Libya should be taken by the Libyan people. Currently, Libya is not a State Party to the Rome Statute. Therefore, intervention by the ICC on the alleged crimes committed in Libya can occur only if the Libyan authorities accept the jurisdiction of the Court, (through article 12(3) of the Rome Statute). In the absence of such step, the United Nations Security Council can decide to refer the situation to the Court. The Office of the Prosecutor will act only after either decision is taken</blockquote>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Tuesday urged the Libyan government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">end to human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government's response to recent protests may amount to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">crimes against humanity</a> [press release]. Pillay called for an end to human rights abuses, citing the use of machine guns, snipers and military planes against protesters, and emphasized the need for an independent investigation.

<p>The situation in Libya has escalated over days of continued protests and violent suppression by security forces. On Monday, Saif al-Islam, son of Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], announced in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piEslrLNSoQ">televised address </a> [video] following several days of protests that the Libyan government is <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">considering adopting a constitution</a> [JURIST report] and allowing greater freedoms. The protests began last week following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa </a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports].

on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/tjug/en/110223_djordjevic_judgt_en.pdf">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF] former senior Serbian police official <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf">Vlastimir Djordjevic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/djordjevic/4">case materials</a>] on five counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10606">sentencing him to 27 years</a> [press release]. Djordjevic was convicted of committing racial persecution through deportation and forcible transfer through his participation in a joint criminal enterprise and two counts of murder&#8212;one as a crime against humanity and the other as a violation of the laws or customs of war under <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf">Article 3 and 5 of the Statute of the ICTY</a> [statute; PDF], which resulted in the death of at least 724 Kosovo Albanians. Djordjevic was the Assistant Minister of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) and Chief of its Public Security Department (RJB) during a period of war crimes against Kosovo Albanians in 1999. Djordjevic claimed that he did not have effective control over the MUP. The ICTY rejected his argument, citing evidence that Djordjevic knew of the unlawful police conduct, coordinated the work of MUP forces, had lawful powers and exercised control over the police in Kosovo, and played a critical role in the execution of the criminal enterprise. Djordjevic was held responsible for the March 26, 1999, shooting and torching of 114 men and boys, deportation of 200,000 Kosovo Albanians and for playing a leading role in concealing the murder of Kosovo Albanians. Vlastimir Djordjevic is the eighh former senior Serbian official to be tried for the crimes committed in Kosovo and the sixth to be convicted. 

<p>The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/icty-begins-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">began the war crimes trial</a> [JURIST report] against Djordjevic in January 2009. Djordjevic was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/montenegro-arrests-un-indicted-war.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 and formally <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/ind/en/080602.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in July 2008 for his participation in crimes against humanity, murder and illegal deportation.

Martin</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-considers-federal-habeas-corpus-cases.php">report</a>] that a state law barring a prisoner from collaterally attacking his conviction is adequate to support a procedural bar to filing a <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. The decision upholds a California state law preventing prisoners from collaterally attacking their judgment when the prisoner "substantially delayed" filing his <em>habeas</em> petition. Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the court has the responsibility to ensure that state procedural claims do not discriminate against claims of federal rights, but determined that California's timeliness rule does not operate to the particular disadvantage of such rights of the petitioner. Ginsburg stated that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-finds-state-procedural.php">recent precedent</a> [JURIST report] gave clear guidance on the issue: <blockquote>In a recent decision,  Beard v.  Kindler, ... this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal <em>habeas</em> petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default. Guided by that decision, we hold that  California is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for <em>habeas</em> petitions (which would almost certainly rule out Martin's nearly five-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current practice, but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments. In so ruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that California's time  bar, either by design or in operation, discriminates against federal claims or claimants.</blockquote> The judgment reversed Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2009/11/20/08-15752.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF], which held that the state's law was not well-established or "consistently applied" and therefore did not constitute a procedural bar to collaterally attacking the conviction.

<p>The petitioner, Charles Martin, was sentenced to life without parole for murder and filed a <em>habeas</em> petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in the California Supreme Court, nearly fives years after his conviction became final. He had no explanation for the delay in the filing. The court dismissed Martin's claim as untimely under the California law. Having exhausted his state remedies, Martin filed a federal <em>habeas</em> petition in the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caed/staticOther/page_455.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] raising the same issues. The district court dismissed the petition as untimely stating that the rejection "rested on an adequate and independent state ground, i.e., Martin's failure to seek relief in state court without substantial delay."</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the 40-minute interview, Abel-Jalil, who <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110221/ap_on_re_af/af_libya_protests">resigned</a> [AP report] earlier this week in opposition of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">violent response to protesters</a> [JURIST report], claimed to have evidence that Gaddafi gave direct orders to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7728434.stm">Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=megrahi">news archive</a>] to conduct the bombing. Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the Pan Am bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison, which he subsequently appealed. Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-secretary-orders.php">released from custody</a> [JURIST report] in August 2009 on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with terminal cancer and subsequently returned to his native Libya. Libyan officials began lobbying for Megrahi's release after his diagnosis in September 2008, stating that allowing Megrahi to die in Scottish custody would be the equivalent of a death sentence. Libyan officials threatened "severe ramifications to UK interests" if Megrahi was not released. According to Abel-Jalil, Gaddafi did everything in his power to have Megrahi released and returned from Scotland, while concealing his own involvement.

<p>Earlier this month, the UK's top civil servant <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-did-not-pressure-scotland-to-release-lockerbie-bomber-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the previous administration "[did] all it could" to facilitate a Libyan appeal to allow for the release of Megrahi from a Scottish prison, but that the decision-making power was solely within the province of the Scottish Government. Last August, the Obama administration urged Libyan authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-administration-urges-return-to-prison-for-lockerbie-bomber.php">return Megrahi to a Scottish prison</a> [JURIST report] to serve the remainder of his sentence. Also in August, the opposition <a href="http://www.scottishlabour.org.uk/home">Scottish Labour Party</a> [party website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/scotland-lawmakers-call-for-release-of-lockerbie-bomber-medical-records.php">publication of all medical evidence</a> [JURIST report] related to Megrahi's release. In July, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-lawmakers-call-for-investigation-into-bp-involvement-in-release-of-lockerbie-bomber.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the role that <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP">news archive</a>], which was engaged in contract negotiations to explore drilling in Libya and was suffering "significant financial loss" while these contracts remained unsigned, may have played in Megrahi's release. Megrahi's release was controversial, with both <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-officials-criticize-lockerbie-bomber.php">US officials</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/scotland-parliament-votes-to-condemn.php">Scottish Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] condemning it. Libya <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/libya-makes-final-payment-to-terrorism.php">made its final compensation payment</a> [JURIST report] to a US fund for victims' families in November 2008 after agreeing to accept responsibility for the 1988 airline bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland that <a href="http://www.victimsofpanamflight103.org/">killed all 259 on board</a> [memorial website] and 11 others, including 180 Americans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill would require individuals suspected of being illegal to provide proof of their legal status and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only. Illegal immigrants would also be ineligible for in-state tuition rates, financial aid, grants or scholarships at Indiana state colleges and universities. Following the vote, <a href="http://www.in.gov/s29/">Senator Mike Delph</a> (R) [official website], author of the legislation, <a href="http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/67349.htm">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Today's vote was a key step in the legislative process. I will continue to work with my fellow lawmakers to send a clear message that Indiana will no longer be a sanctuary for people who are in our state and country illegally because of our federal government's failure to act on illegal immigration. It's time that we put an end to press one for English and two for Spanish in our state. We also must remove the handcuffs from our law enforcement by providing them with the tools and training necessary to identify individuals in our country illegally and then transfer them to federal custody.</blockquote>Various Indiana employers and business groups <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/23/us-immigration-indiana-idUSTRE71M5HN20110223">oppose the legislation</a> [Reuters report], including the <a href="http://www.indychamber.com/">Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce</a> [official website], which says it will have a chilling effect on business. The legislation would strip businesses of tax deductions for each illegal employee and require the use of the E-Verify System to check the eligibility status of employees. The bill now moves to the Indiana House of Representatives.

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.utah.gov/house/index.html">Utah House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/utah-house-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">also passed</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona-style immigration law. Unlike its Arizona predecessor, the Utah immigration bill does not provide an avenue for private citizens to sue local police who do not enforce the law. The issue of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] has been the subject of legislation and lawsuits across the country, and several states have <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST reports] similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law. The Arizona law, which has been widely criticized as unconstitutional for allegedly legalizing racial profiling, has sparked a nationwide debate on immigration policy, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">prompting calls for immigration reform</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile].

Last week, Hawaii's <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/site1/senate/senate.asp">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-senate-approves-same-sex-unions-governor-to-sign-into-law-soon.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=232">18-5</a> [bill history] to give final approval to the bill. Prior to that, Hawaii's <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-house-passes-bill-recognizing-same-sex-civil-unions.php">House of Representatives approved the same bill</a> [JURIST report]. A similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] in July by former governor Linda Lingle (R), who felt that, because it was an issue of "such significant societal importance," it was better suited for a vote in a public referendum. Hawaii is now the seventh state to offer essentially the same benefits and protections afforded to marriages to civil unions.

<p>Earlier this month, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn (D) <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions in the state. The "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." Additionally, it will allow religious institutions within the state to choose whether to observe or officiate the union. Opponents fear that this bill will move Illinois closer to legalizing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] and threaten the sanctity of marriage. The new law is set to take effect on June 1. In contrast, last month the Wyoming Senate voted 20-10 in favor of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-senate-advances--banning-same-sex-marraige.php">constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages from any jurisdiction. The decision, which was split down party lines, will advance to the state House of Representatives, where it needs a two-thirds vote to succeed. If approved there, it will need to be signed by Governor Matt Mead (R) and then appear as a referendum item on the 2012 ballot. The following day, the House Judiciary Committee also <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_ce747eaa-2aff-11e0-b207-001cc4c03286.html">voted 5-4</a> [Star-Tribune report] to defeat House Bill 150, which would have recognized civil unions in the state. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkkk.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The number of hate groups in the US rose to <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/us-hate-groups-top-1000">more than 1,000</a> [press release] during 2010, according to a <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/spring/the-year-in-hate-extremism-2010">report</a> [text] released Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/?ref=logo">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website]. The SPLC reports this is the first time that these types of groups have exceeded 1,000 since the it started its monitoring in the 1980s. According to SPLC's <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map">hate group map</a> [official map] the highest number (68) of hate groups exist in California, while the lowest number (0) were reported in Alaska and Hawaii. The SPLC also noted that more than 300 new <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/spring/active-patriot-groups-in-the-us">"Patriot" movements</a> [complete list] appeared in 2010. These groups embrace conspiracy theories about the US government and tend to view the government as their enemy. Finally, there are now <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/spring/the-year-in-nativism/nativist-extremists">319 Nativist extreme groups</a> [complete list] in the US. The classification of some groups has been disputed. In particular, House Speaker <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official profile] and Minnesota State Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0223/Annual-report-cites-rise-in-hate-groups-but-some-ask-What-is-hate">protested</a> [CSM report] the SPLC's listing of the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group. SPLC has defended the classification saying that the groups deliberately disseminated untrue information about gay people. In its report, SPLC cites a number of dramatic incidents, including the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-federal-judge-killed-in-shooting-congresswoman-in-critical-condition.php">shooting</a> [JURIST report] of Congresswoman <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [official website] and the January arrest of a neo-Nazi at the Arizona border who was armed with grenades, as acts of "terrorism" committed by the swelling number of radical groups in the US. 

<p>In June of last year, federal prosecutors filed <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/download/2010/0602/23770715.pdf">additional charges</a> [superseding indictment, PDF] against four members of the "Christian warrior" militia, Hutaree, alleging <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-prosecutors-bring-additional-charges-against-michigan-militia-members.php">possession of machine guns and unregistered rifles</a> [JURIST report], as well as use of firearms during a violent crime. Nine members of the militia were originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/militia-members-indicted-for-plotting.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in March on charges of seditious conspiracy, attempted use of weapons of mass destruction, teaching the use of explosive materials, and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence in connection with a plan to kill Michigan law enforcement officers. Four members of the militia, including one of the men named in the new indictment, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-orders-release-of-three-michigan-militia-suspects.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] one month earlier. Militia groups such as the Hutaree are reportedly on the rise in the US. A recent report by the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441251">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> [advocacy website] suggests that a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/lack-of-internet-regulations-enables.php">lack of regulation on the Internet</a> [JURIST report] is fueling this increased prevalence. A <a href="/hotline/2010/04/hutaree-militia-arrests-reflect-growth.php">2009 report</a> [JURIST comment] by SPLC noted that these groups are <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/anti-government-militias-growing-in-us.php">making a comeback</a> [JURIST report] after declining in number for several years. The SPLC said that such groups are generally anti-tax, anti-immigration, and increasingly racially motivated since the election of the country's first African-American president, Barack Obama. The SPLC also warned that these groups could soon pose a security risk to the country, quoting one official as saying "[a]ll it's lacking is a spark. I think it's only a matter of time before you see threats and violence."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A group of law professors asked Congress Wednesday 
to extend the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/conduct/Vol02A-Ch02.pdf">Code of Conduct for United States Judges</a> [text, PDF] to apply to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. In a <a href="http://www.afj.org/judicial_ethics_sign_on_letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House</a> and <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Comittees</a> [official websites], more than 100 law professors representing 67 schools urged Congress to advance legislation to apply the Code to Supreme Court justices, establish a procedural framework for enforcement, require a written opinion for every denial of a motion to recuse and create a review procedure for those decisions. In support of their position, the professors cited the court's own ruling in <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-rules-iraq-sovereign.php">Caperton v. AT Massey Coal</a> [JURIST report], a 2009 case in which the court decried the self-judging of ethics issues by judges. The group argued that, by its own reasoning, the lack of review for the same judgments made by Supreme Court justices is inappropriate:<blockquote>Unlike <em>Caperton</em>, where the Supreme Court reversed the self-judged view of a single state court judge, there is no review procedure for recusal decisions by Supreme Court justices. Individual justices rule themselves on motions to recuse, or decide sua sponte to recuse in cases where no motion is filed. No written opinion is required in either situation. The opacity and non-reviewability of this process erodes public confidence in the integrity of the Court. The fundamental principle that "no man may be a judge in his own case" was articulated by Lord Coke in the seventeenth century, yet inexplicably we still allow Supreme Court justices to be the sole judge of themselves on recusal issues.</blockquote><a href="http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov">Rep. Chris Murphy</a> (D-CT) [official website] announced last week that he plans to <a href="http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=482&Itemid=1">introduce a bill</a> [press release] to address such ethical issues.

<p>Wednesday's letter comes amid a wave of criticism for the court as a series of politically charged and divisive decisions has been followed by accusations of ethically troubling activities by justices <a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/clarence_thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/antonin_scalia">Antonin Scalia</a> and <a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/samuel_a_alito_jr">Samuel Alito</a> [Oyez profiles]. Of particular focus have been questions surrounding Thomas and Scalia's relationships with conservative businessmen David and Charles Koch, owners of <a href="http://www.kochind.com/">Koch Industries</a> [corporate website], a multibillion dollar company with large oil, gas and paper operations which is involved in hundreds of cases currently before federal judges. In January, <a href="http://www.commoncause.org">Common Cause</a> [advocacy group] <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=4773617&ct=9039331">petitioned</a> [text] the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to investigate the justices' relationship with the company and the impact it may have had on the court's controversial 5-4 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [materials] last year. Thomas has also fallen under fire for his wife's founding of <a href="libertyinc.co">Liberty Consulting</a> [corporate website], a right-leaning political consultancy, shortly after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/us/politics/05thomas.html?scp=17&sq=judge+court&st=nyt#">leaving her position as the head of Liberty Central</a> [NYT report], a conservative website with ties to the Tea Party movement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The trial chamber, in a confidential ruling, rejected contentions of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110223/ap_on_re_eu/eu_international_court_congo">prosecutorial misconduct</a> [AP report] levied by Lubanga's defense team, including allegations that prosecutors, through proxies, offered bribes to witnesses and coached testimony. Lubanga had previously been ordered <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-orders-release-of-congo-militia-leader-lubanga-pending-appeal.php">released from custody</a> and his trial <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-suspends-trial-of-congo-militia-leader-lubanga.php">stayed</a> until prosecutors complied with a directive to provide certain information to the defense, though the ICC appeals chamber later rescinded those orders and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-to-continue-proceedings-against-congo-militia-leader-lubanga.php">directed</a> [JURIST reports] the trial to proceed. 

<p>Lubanga is accused of war crimes for allegedly recruiting child soldiers to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2002-2003.

The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] last July after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintains he is innocent</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against him. He became the first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC, formed in 2002, after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in March 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bills <a href = "http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_01_0000.pdf">2035</a> [text, PDF] and <A href = "http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_02_0000.odt">2281</a> [text, ODT] passed overwhelmingly, in voice votes of <a href = "http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/odt_view/je_20110224101650_035336/">96 to 25</a> [text, ODT] and <a href = "http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/odt_view/je_20110224103406_715068/">91 to 30</a> [text, ODT], respectively. If the bills are approved by the Senate, Kansas residents will not be able to obtain an abortion after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. Other restrictions include a stringent parental consent and notification system for a minor's abortion and "clear and convincing" evidence for a judicial bypass of parental consent; the ability to bring a civil suit against abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; the right for criminal prosecution of abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; and for abortion providers to inform patients that the fetus is a "whole, separate, unique, living human being." Opponents of the fetal-pain regulation believe this limitation violates the Supreme Court ruling in <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text], which allows for abortions until the fetus can survive viably outside the womb, typically at 22 or 23 weeks. There is no indication when the Senate will vote on either bill, though they are both expected to pass.

<p>The bill, similar to a <A href = "/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">recent Nebraska act</a> [JURIST report] based on a fetal-pain guideline, was formulated partly in reaction to the assassination of late-term abortion provider doctor <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8077021.stm">George Tiller</a> [BBC report], who practiced out of Wichita. Kansas' bills are the first major actions on abortion in the US in 2011, although several state legislatures are considering similar measures. In December the Alaska Superior Court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/alaska-judge-upholds-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">upheld a parental consent notification law</a>, whereas in November, Colorado voters <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">rejected an amendment</a> [JURIST reports] that would have granted fetuses a "personhood" status, effectively banning abortion. In June, then-Florida governor Charlie Crist <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. Oklahoma lawmakers <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] in May requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. This followed laws <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">passed the month before</a> [JURIST report], prohibiting abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus, protecting medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs, and regulating the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Zagel <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-il-blagojevichtrial,0,2697557.story">agreed to dismiss</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] charges of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and one count of wire fraud, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but Blagojevich will still face 20 other charges, including attempting to sell the Senate seat vacated by US President Barack Obama, making appointments based on anticipated campaign contributions and taking kickbacks from a number of companies. At the hearing, prosecutors alluded to the fact that dropping some of the more complicated charges will simplify their case and give them a better chance of obtaining convictions on the remaining charges. In a statement, <a href="http://www.prnewschannel.com/absolutenm/templates/?z=4&a=3548">Blagojevich maintained his innocence</a> [press release]:  <blockquote>Today's developments in court are three steps in the right direction in what has been along and arduous journey for my wife, for my children and for me. I will continue to fight to clear my name and prove to the people of Illinois that I didn't let them down.</blockquote> Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on the 23 additional charges.

<p>In Blagojevich's first trial, the jury deliberated for 14 days after the 11-week trial but was unable to reach a consensus on all but one of the charges. According to reports, there was a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/blagojevich/ct-met-blagojevich-verdict-jury-20100818,0,1234825.story">lone holdout</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] on the convictions regarding the sale of Obama's Senate seat. The female juror allegedly stated that due to the lack of a "smoking gun" she was unable to convict Blagojevich of the crimes. Last September, lawyers for Blagojevich asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-override-false-statements-conviction.php">throw out the sole conviction</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government failed to meet its required burden of proof and that cross-examinations by the defense were <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/blagojevich-on-trial/2010/09/blagojevich-lawyers-seek-to-throw-out-conviction-cite-plethora-of-errors.html">plagued by "obstructionist" objections</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report], which the court continuously sustained. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kenneth Ranftle and Craig Leiby were married legally in Canada in 2008 after more than 20 years together. Ranftle died a few months later in New York, leaving most of his multi-million dollar estate to Leiby. Ranftle's brother challenged the validity of the couple's marriage and argued that recognition of the marriage violated New York public policy. The unanimous panel said in its opinion:<blockquote>[T]he Legislature's failure to authorize same-sex couples to enter into marriage in New York or require recognition of validly performed out-of-state same-sex marriages, cannot serve as an expression of public policy for the State. In the absence of an express statutory prohibition ... legislative action or inaction does not qualify as an exception to the marriage recognition rule.</blockquote>In 2008, then-governor David Paterson ordered all state agencies to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/new-york-to-recognize-out-of-state-same.php">recognize same-sex marriages from other states</a> [JURIST report] as legal marriages for purposes of New York law. The order followed a decision by an intermediate New York appellate court holding that legal same-sex marriages performed outside the state are <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-york-court-rules-that-state-must.php">entitled to recognition</a> [JURIST report] in New York.

<p>The validity of <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be hotly debated in the US. The New York appeals court decision came one day after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. The New York State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-york-state-assembly-approves-same.php">approved same-sex marriage legislation</a> in 2009, but the bill was later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">defeated</a> [JURIST reports] in the Senate. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">Washington, DC</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's statement, directed at Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], reminded the UN Human Rights Council of the repeated calls by numerous nations for Gaddafi to renounce the use of violence. After describing accounts of the situation on the ground in Libya, Pillay reiterated the prior calls for a cessation to violence and called on the Council to rise to action: <blockquote>[L]et us be clear that today's shocking and brutal situation is the direct outcome of a callous disregard for the rights and freedom of Libyans that has marked the almost four-decade long grip on power by the current ruler. Justice for ongoing as well as past abuses must be attained in order to be meaningful for all the victims. There can be no doubt about the need for action by this Council now. The Human Rights Council and its mechanisms should step in vigorously to help end violence in Libya and hold those perpetrating the atrocities accountable. The Council should use all means available to compel the Libyan Government to respect the human rights and heed the will of its people. The victims of human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law deserve no less.</blockquote>Also on Friday, the Libyan delegation to the UN <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sns-rt-geneva-libyan-envoy-lde71o1o1-20110225,0,3297393.story">disavowed any link to Gaddafi</a> [Reuters report] in front of the Human Rights Council, with the Libyan envoy saying that his delegation represented the Libyan people.

<p>The situation in Libya has escalated over days of continued protests and violent suppression by security forces. On Wednesday, Chief Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-libya-crimes-chief-prosecutor.php">ICC cannot investigate possible crimes in Libya</a> [JURIST report] because the country is not a party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [materials]. The statement came after Pillay said earlier this week that the Libyan government's response to recent protests may <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">amount to crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay cited the use of machine guns, snipers and military planes against protesters, calling for an independent investigation. The protests began last week following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports]. Protesters have demanded Gaddafi's resignation and government reform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, entitled Civil Marriage Protection Act, would alter existing legislation that validates only heterosexual marriage. Approval of the Act will give gay couples the same full rights of marriage as straight, married couples, but will allow exemptions for religious leaders who object to same-sex marriage.  Passed with a 25-21 Senate vote, the bill will now be turned over to the  <a href="http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/06hse/html/hse.html">House of Delegates</a> [official website] which is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/24/AR2011022406625.html">split on the issue </a> [WP report]. 

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage continues to be hotly debated in the US. Earlier this week, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. Earlier this week, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-governor-signs-same-sex-unions-bill-into-law.php">signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law</a>, while last week, the Wyoming Senate approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST reports] and civil unions performed in other jurisdictions. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During a special session, the 47-member council unanimously adopted the resolution, which also calls upon the Libyan government to protect its population and respect the will of its people. According to the resolution, the UNHRC:<blockquote>Expresses deep concern with the situation in Libya, strongly condemns the recent gross and systematic human rights violations committed in Libya, including indiscriminate armed attacks against civilians, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detention and torture of peaceful demonstrators, some of which may also amount to crimes against humanity; [and] Decides to urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of inquiry, to be appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Libya.</blockquote>UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-action-to-halt-libya-violence.php">spoke to the UNHRC</a> [JURIST report] earlier Friday, calling for the Libyan government to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">stop the violence directed at protesters</a> [statement] for the Council to rise to action.

<p>The situation in Libya has escalated over days of continued protests and violent suppression by security forces. On Wednesday, Chief Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-libya-crimes-chief-prosecutor.php">ICC cannot investigate possible crimes in Libya</a> [JURIST report] because the country is not a party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [materials]. The statement came after Pillay said earlier this week that the Libyan government's response to recent protests may <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">amount to crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay cited the use of machine guns, snipers and military planes against protesters, calling for an independent investigation. The protests began last week following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports]. Protesters have demanded Gaddafi's resignation and government reform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The attempted murder charge carries with it a possible life sentence. The pirates were captured during the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12248096">Samho Jewelry raid</a> [BBC report] last month, when South Korean commandos killed eight other pirates while rescuing all 21 crew members. Prosecutors believe that this is the same group of pirates responsible for <a href="http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2932754">hijacking another Samho ship</a> [<em>JoonAng Daily</em> report], the Samho Dream, last year.

<p>Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is an ongoing international concern, and several countries have started taking legal action against suspected Somali pirates. Earlier this month, seven suspected Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/malaysia-court-charges-suspected-somali-pirates.php">appeared in Malaysian court</a> [JURIST report], charged with firearms offenses and, if convicted, could face the death penalty. Malaysia was the first Asian country to take formal legal action against suspect pirates. The suspects, who did not enter pleas, were also arrested in January after allegedly firing at Malaysian authorities while hijacking a merchant ship in the Gulf of Aden. Three of the seven suspects are only 15 years old and will not face the death penalty because of their age. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Those removed are <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-02/25/c_13750127.htm">non-violent economic crimes</a> [Xinhua report] and include smuggling cultural relics, precious metals and rare animals; fraudulent activities with financial bills and letters of credit; fraudulent export tax refunds; teaching of crime-committing methods; and robbing ancient cultural ruins. The amendment also restricts death sentences issued to persons over 75 and is the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-02/25/content_12081299.htm">first amendment</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report] of death penalty crimes since 1979. Notably, some economic crimes, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-not-considering-eliminating-death-penalty-for-corruption.php">corruption</a> [JURIST report], were not removed from the list, and the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-02-25-China-death-penalty_N.htm">death penalty enjoys wide public support in China</a> [AP report]. The amendment, which will take effect on May 1, is the latest move by the Chinese government to reduce the number of death sentences ordered by the country's courts.

<p>The amendment was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/china-considering-reducing-death-penalty-crimes.php">originally proposed</a> [JURIST report] in August, and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has criticized the measure as legal housekeeping because the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12580504">crimes are rarely punished by execution</a> [BBC report]. AI estimates that China executes thousands of people every year&#8212;more than the rest of the world combined&#8212;but the actual figure is a closely guarded state secret. Last February, the <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People's Court of China</a> [official website, in Chinese] issued <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-high-court-limits-use-of-death.php">new guidelines for limiting capital punishment</a> [JURIST report] in Chinese courts to "extremely serious" crimes.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court said it was <a href="http://www.expatica.com/es/news/spanish-news/spain-to-probe-guantanamo-torture-claims_132455.html">competent to take the case</a> [<em>Expatica</em> report, in Spanish] because the complainant, Lahcen Ikassrien, who was held at Guantanamo from 2001 to 2005, had been a Spanish resident for 13 years. The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/spanish-judges-rule-case-us-torture-can-continue">endorsed the court's decision</a> [press release] to continue the investigation:<blockquote>This is a monumental decision that will enable a Spanish judge to continue a case on the "authorized and systematic plan of torture and ill treatment" by U.S. officials at Guantanamo. Geoffrey Miller, the former commanding officer at Guantanamo, has already been implicated, and the case will surely move up the chain of command. Since the U.S. government has not only failed to investigate the illegal actions of its own officials and, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks,  also sought to interfere in the Spanish judicial process and stop the case from proceeding, this will be the first real investigation of the U.S. torture program.</blockquote>Judge Pablo Ruz, who replaced the controversial judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>], will continue overseeing the proceedings.

<p>The court first <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">opened the investigation in April 2009</a> [JURIST report], looking into torture allegations at Guantanamo Bay made by four former prisoners, including Ikassrien. The court based its decision on statements by the prisoners who claimed they were subject to various forms of physical and mental abuse during their imprisonment, as well as <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">CIA interrogation memos</a> [JURIST report] detailing a plan which allegedly authorized the systematic torture and mistreatment of persons who were deprived the basic rights of detainees. The alleged abuses violated the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials], the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [UN materials], and other international treaties, the court said. In July 2005, US officials at Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/moroccan-gitmo-prisoner-extradited-to.php">extradited Ikassrien to Spain</a> [JURIST report] to answer charges that he assisted al-Qaeda cell leader Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas in planning the 9/11 terror attacks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Obama administration on Friday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/02/25/10-56634_opening_brief.pdf">asked</a> [brief, PDF] the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to delay its review of an order striking down the military's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask, Don't Tell"</a> policy (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>] because the policy will soon be ended. In December, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed legislation that would repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] as soon as the president, secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify that the necessary policies and procedures are in place within the military to implement the repeal. After receiving certification, the full repeal must take effect within 60 days. Due to this, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed the brief requesting that the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] be granted more time to train the troops and take further measures outlined by Congress before the court officially rules on the case. The DOJ argued that an immediate decision would be premature: <blockquote>This case will become moot upon the effective date of the repeal of &#167; 654, rendering any judicial disposition unnecessary. That date is swiftly approaching. As a result, the Court should withhold further proceedings and decision in this matter, both out of the respect owed to the orderly repeal process undertaken by the political branches and in furtherance of the policy favoring avoidance of deciding constitutional questions unnecessarily.</blockquote> The DOJ attorneys argued that, should the court reach a decision before the repeal process is complete, the court should reverse the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">district court decision</a> [JURIST report] because the plaintiff lacks standing and the district court exceeded its remedial authority.

<p>The Obama administration had <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-administration-seeks-to-delay-dont-ask-dont-tell-appeal.php">sought a delay in the briefing schedule</a> [JURIST report] in January shortly after Congress passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [materials]. In December, three former service members discharged under DADT filed a complaint against the DOD <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-file-suit-seeking-reinstatement.php">seeking reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] and the declaration that their discharges under the statute, and the statute itself, are unconstitutional. In November, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. The policy was struck down by a federal judge in September, but the Ninth Circuit has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stayed that ruling</a> [JURIST report]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Libya's UN Ambassador Abdurrahman Shalgam, who use to be a close confidant of Gaddafi, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/world/africa/27nations.html?_r=2&hp">stated</a> [NY Times report] that the resolution could help end the "fascist regime" in the north African country. The sanctions include an arms embargo, the freezing of assets, and a travel ban on 16 Libyan leaders. Although Libya is not a signatory to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], which created the ICC, the Security Council voted that it should nonetheless be subject to its investigation.

<p>The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Friday adopted a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15specialsession/Ad%20adopted%20_resolution.doc">resolution</a> [text, DOC] condemning the recent violence in Libya and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php">ordering an international inquiry into alleged abuses</a> [JURIST report]. During a special session, the 47-member council unanimously adopted the resolution, which also calls upon the Libyan government to protect its population and respect the will of its people.

The protests began last week following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports].

The proposed constitutional amendments also make it easier for a candidate to obtain a nomination. The existing <a href="http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolcon.htm">Egyptian Constitution</a> [text] required the support of 250 elected officials, whereas the proposed changes will call for the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011226163611509450.html">signatures of just 30 parliamentarians</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The changes will make it more difficult for a president to maintain the <a href="http://www.emerglobal.com/lex/law-1958-162">state of emergency laws</a> [text, in Arabic] that Mubarak kept in place for nearly 30 years. The committee was appointed by Egypt's military, which is running the country until an election is held in six months. The military council stated that it will <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110227/ts_nm/us_egypt_referendum;_ylt=A0wNdPeihmpNZB0AzzZ34T0D">issue a snap referendum</a> [Reuters report] next month on the proposed constitutional amendments and plans to have the vote complete by the end of March.

<p>Last week Egypt's chief prosecutor requested that Foreign Ministry officials take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-vp-announces-political-agreements-and-committee-to-reform-constitution.php">freeze any foreign assets belonging to Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and his family. Prosecutor Abdel Magid made the request even though Mubarak submitted a declaration of wealth indicating that he possessed no foreign assets. Mubarak stepped down after <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121161511674298.html">nearly three weeks of demonstrations</a> [Al Jazeera report] protesting the Egyptian government and calling for his resignation. His resignation left state affairs in the hands of the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">pledged to lift the country's emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that were in place for nearly 30 years once circumstances in the country improved. The Council also vowed to have a peaceful transition to power and promised not to prosecute "honourable people who refused corruption and demanded for reform." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttobacco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/recent_appellate.asp">Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously decided to reopen a $10.1 billion class action against <a href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx">Philip Morris</a> [corporate website] involving deceptive marketing practices in light of a favorable 2008 US Supreme Court ruling on the subject matter. The class represented in the <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2006/watvphi">lawsuit</a> [Duke Law backgrounder] claims that Philip Morris violated state law when it misled consumers into thinking that "light" cigarettes were safer and contained less tar. The plaintiffs allege that the light cigarettes actually contain a more toxic form of tar than the original brand. The trial court originally found on behalf of the plaintiffs, but the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] overturned the verdict in 2005 stating that Philip Morris could not be held liable under state law due to the fact that the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] allowed the use of "light" on cigarette packaging. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in 2006 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1284.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the Supreme Court's ruling and the case was dismissed. However, in 2008 the US Supreme Court, in a case concerning the marketing of "light" cigarettes, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1216.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that state consumer protection laws can be used to hold cigarette companies liable. A lawyer for Philip Morris calls the claims "meritless" and says that the court's ruling was based on a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jz_aG0yjJMfUH9ypDFVnlBo0QDgw?docId=c30aca80464a4d9384aa1d9443a4495d">statute of limitations</a> [AP report] and not the merits of the case. 

<p>Philip Morris and other cigarette companies are currently involved in numerous lawsuits. Last year, Philip Morris and <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a> [corporate website], along with an industry trade group, filed an <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PM-v.-Jackson-class-ax-10-7351.pdf">appeal</a> [cert. petition, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-tobacco-companies-appeal-270-million-settlement-to-supreme-court.php">report</a>] with the US Supreme Court to overturn a $271.5 million class action settlement. The settlement was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10851376620769925503#[1]">awarded</a> [judgment, text] by the <a href="http://www.la4th.org/">Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in order to establish a fund meant to help Louisianans quit smoking. In 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-decertifies-class.php">overturned class action certification</a> [JURIST report] for a lawsuit brought by "light" cigarette smokers against Philip Morris and other light cigarette makers. The class action, which included anyone who has ever bought light cigarettes since they hit the market in the 1970s, had alleged that tobacco companies used deceptive advertising tactics to mislead smokers in response to growing health concerns over the risks of smoking cigarettes.

The suit, filed by <a href="http://www.lorillard.com/index.php?id=1">Lorillard, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company</a> [corporate websites] seeks to prevent the FDA from relying on a forthcoming recommendation on the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/26/lorillard-fda-lawsuit-idUSN2513891620110226">use of menthol in cigarettes</a> [Reuters report]. The suit alleges that three members of the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/advisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/tobaccoproductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm">Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee</a> [official website], Doctors Neil Benowitz, Jack Henningfield and Jonathan Samet, have made thousands of dollars as expert witnesses in litigation against tobacco product manufacturers and have "continuing financial relationships" with pharmaceutical companies that make smoking-cessation products. The FDA is not required to comply with the advisory committee's recommendation, but the tobacco companies fear any ban on menthol cigarettes. The recommendation is expected to be released by March 23, 2011. 

<p>Just last year, the FDA <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/03/20100318a.html">announced</a> [press release] a final <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/FDA-1995-N-0259-0002.htm">rule</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fda-announces-final-rule-restricting.php">restricting tobacco sales and promotions</a> [JURIST report] directed at youth. The Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents are a set of broad regulations "designed to significantly curb access to and the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to children and adolescents in the United States." In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking and Tobacco Prevention Act</a> [HR 1256 text], which grants the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative, and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. Under the bill, the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products but does not permit the agency to regulate tobacco leaf that is not in the hands of tobacco product manufacturers or producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco growers, tobacco warehouses, or tobacco grower cooperatives. The FDA first began to regulate the tobacco industry in 1996, but, in 2000 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html">FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</a> [opinion text] that Congress had not provided the FDA with the authority to regulate tobacco products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, the Security Council voted that it should nonetheless be subject to its investigation. 

<p>The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Friday adopted a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15specialsession/Ad%20adopted%20_resolution.doc">resolution</a> [text, DOC] condemning the recent violence in Libya and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php">ordering an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into alleged abuses.

In Pillay's opening statement to the Sixteenth Session of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] she  <a href="http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/conferences/unhrc/sixteenth/hrc110228am1-eng.rm?start=00:07:26&end=00:14:22">urged the body and the international community</a> [video] to remain vigilant against Libya because the danger of violence against protesters still exists. The UNHRC took the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php">unprecedented step</a> [JURIST report] of sanctioning Libya last week by unanimously recommending its suspension. Pillay said:<blockquote>Let me reiterate, that the illegal and excessively heavy-handed response of a number governments is unacceptable. Repression of peaceful expression of dissent is also intolerable. I remind all those concerned that widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population may amount to crimes under international law. Attacks must be independently investigated and those responsible for them must be held to account.</blockquote>She praised the sanctions against Libya passed last week as a providing the international community with a "solid platform for action." She further stated that "the rights of the protesters must be upheld. The asylum seekers, migrants, and other foreign nationals fleeing the violence must be protected." She urged that international community to allow the popular uprisings to take root and to protect human rights rather than simply favoring stability in the region.

<p>Last week, Pillay called on the Libyan government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-action-to-halt-libya-violence.php">stop the violence directed at protesters</a> [JURIST report] within that nation. Pillay's statement, directed at Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], reminded the UNHRC of the repeated calls by numerous nations for Gaddafi to renounce the use of violence. The situation in Libya escalated last week over days of continued protests and violent suppression by security forces. Chief Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-libya-crimes-chief-prosecutor.php">ICC cannot investigate possible crimes in Libya</a> [JURIST report] because the country is not a party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [materials]. The statement came after Pillay said earlier that the Libyan government's response to recent protests may <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">amount to crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report].

The court found Thursday that under Article 22(1) of the Constitution, a court could not decide a criminal case without a lawyer present for the defendant, and should appoint counsel where the defendant cannot obtain a lawyer. Citing the US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] cases of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Powell+v.+Alabama&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=370328547336451678&scilh=0">Powell v. Alabama</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Gideon+v.+Wainwright&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=694784363938594707&scilh=0">Gideon v. Wainwright</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Brewer+v.+William&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=8803339074305789315&scilh=0">Brewer v. William</a> [opinion texts] to support its decision, the Supreme Court of India went on to note that even the defendants at the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Nuremberg_trials.html">Nuremberg trials</a> [LOC backgrounder] had a right to counsel, as did defendants in England and ancient Rome. From this the court concluded that it was "not bringing into existence a new principle but simply recognizing what already existed and which civilized people have long enjoyed." The court continued:<blockquote>The Founding Fathers of our Constitution were themselves freedom fighters who had seen civil liberties of our people trampled under foreign rule, and who had themselves been incarcerated for long period under the formula "Na vakeel, na daleel, na appeal" (No lawyer, no hearing, no appeal). Many of them were lawyers by profession, and knew the importance of counsel, particularly in criminal cases. It was for this reason that they provided for assistance by counsel under Article 22 (1), and that provision must be given the widest construction to effectuate the intention of the Founding Fathers.</blockquote>Following the ruling, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Gauhati High Court for rehearing in light of the decision.

<p>The right to counsel has been the subject of numerous court cases worldwide in recent years. In October, the UK Supreme Court ruled that Scottish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uk-supreme-court-rules-suspects-have-right-to-counsel-during-interrogations.php">could no longer question a suspect in custody</a> [JURIST report] without the presence of a lawyer. The court found that the previous law, which permitted interrogation of suspects without a lawyer for up to six hours, violated the Article 6 right to a fair trial of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].

Fitzsimons, who was working as a contractor for the UK security firm, ArmorGroup, now a part of <a href="http://www.g4s.com/">G4S</a> [corporate website], <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/28/british-contractor-jailed-iraq-murders">escaped the death penalty</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] but received the jail sentence for the murders of fellow contractors, Paul McGuigan and Darren Hoare, following an argument between the three men. In addition to the murders, Fitzsimons was also accused of wounding an Iraqi security guard while attempting to leave the scene of the crime. At trial, Fitzsimons admitted that he shot the two men but argued that he did so in self-defense. He also claimed to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD), stemming from his previous military experiences abroad, which the court considered in handing down a lighter sentence. In a press conference, Clive Stafford Smith, Director of <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], a legal action charity working to enforce the human rights of prisoners, <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2011_02_28dannyfitzsimonslifeimprisonment">stated</a> [text]:<blockquote>If G4S had done the proper checks and risk assessments when Danny applied to work with them, they would have quickly seen that he was suffering from serious PTSD, a consequence of loyally serving his country. Instead they conducted minimal checks and sent him off to Iraq. Now Danny could spend the rest of his life in a hostile prison hundreds of miles from home, when he should be receiving psychiatric treatment.</blockquote>Fitzsimons' lawyer plans to appeal and hopes to lessen the sentence by another five years. In the meantime, he will likely be transferred from Baghdad's Green Zone, where the shootings took place, to the Rusafa prison, which is located in another part of the city. Fitzsimons is the first Westerner to be convicted in Iraq since it was invaded in 2003. 

<p>Behavior of military contractors has been an ongoing issue abroad. In September, a report presented by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/mercenaries/">UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-report-urges-heightened-regulation-of-us-military-contractors.php">urged the US</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/mercenaries/docs/A-HRC-15-25-Add3_AEV.pdf">increase regulation of military contractors</a> [text, PDF] employed worldwide, citing alleged human rights abuses and the contractors' lack of transparency and accountability. The UN Working Group met with US officials last summer to discuss the actions of US private military and security companies (PMSCs) and to make recommendations on its findings. The report proposed that the US amend the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> [text] to extend the country's criminal jurisdiction to PMSCs abroad, eliminate judicial immunity for PMSCs, pursue investigations into possible human rights abuses and enact the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4650:">Stop Outsourcing Security (SOS) Act</a> [materials] currently before Congress, which would gradually discontinue the use of PMSCs. According to the report, the predominately American PMSC industry generates up to $100 billion per year, constitutes about half of the US military forces sent to Iraq and Afghanistan and needs continued reform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bryant</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-nasa-background-checks-evidence.php">report</a>] that preliminary inquiries of a wounded citizen concerning the perpetrator and circumstances of the shooting are non-testimonial evidence, rendering them admissible in court. The case involved statements made to police by Anthony Covington identifying Richard Bryant as his assailant and stating the location of the shooting as he lay dying in a gas station parking lot. The trial court admitted Covington's statements into evidence, and Bryant was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. The Michigan Supreme Court <a href="http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/OPINIONS/FINAL/SCT/20090610_S133725_117_Bryant1Mar09-op.Corrected.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF], ruling that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentvi">Sixth Amendment</a> [text], which gives criminal defendants the right to confront witnesses in a court of law. In an opinion delivered by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the US Supreme Court determined that Covington's statements were admissible and not barred by the Confrontation Clause because they were not testimonial statements, but were statements given "to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency" and were not investigatory in nature. Citing recent cases including <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/05-5224P.ZO">Davis v. Washington</a> [opinion, PDF], Sotomayor wrote that "not all those questioned by the police are witnesses and not all 'interrogations by law enforcement officers' ... are subject to the Confrontation Clause." The court took an objective approach in determining what statements would be admissible.<blockquote>An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encounter and the statements and actions of the parties to it provides the most accurate assessment of the "primary purpose of the interrogation." The circumstances in which an encounter occurs&#8212;<em>e.g.</em>, at or near the scene of the crime versus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards&#8212;are clearly matters of objective fact. The statements and actions of the parties must also be objectively evaluated. That is, the relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals' statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent decrying the court's "distorted view," advocating a stricter interpretation of the Confrontation Clause and stating that the opinion leaves relevant jurisprudence "in a shambles." Scalia advocated looking more closely at the victim's purpose in making the statements stating that his "pressing medical needs ... reinforce the testimonial character of his statements." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also filed a dissent.

<p>In 2009, the court ruled on another Confrontation Clause issue in <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/forensic-lab-reports-are-testimonial.php">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> [JURIST report], where it held that a forensic analyst's laboratory report is testimonial evidence under the Confrontation Clause, giving criminal defendants a right to cross-examine the analysts. One week after the Melendez-Diaz ruling, the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-adds-confrontation-clause.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> in Briscoe v. Virginia</a> [JURIST report], to consider whether, if a state allows a prosecutor to introduce a certificate of a forensic laboratory analysis, without presenting the testimony of the analyst who prepared the certificate, the state avoids violating the Confrontation Clause by providing that the accused has a right to call the analyst as his own witness. The court issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/07-11191.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-rules-city-lacks-standing.php">report</a>] in January 2010 stating that the admission of the report without testimony was unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court first <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/italy-judges-question-law-allowing.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi's trial last year to consider the legitimacy of the original law that would have postponed criminal proceedings against him for 18 months. The law now gives the courts the power to assess the severity of the charges to determine if each separate charge is a legitimate impediment to performing official duties. Berlusconi was <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/politica/2011/02/28/visualizza_new.html_1562576959.html">absent </a> [ANSA, in Italian] for Monday's hearing. His lawyers, however, did not invoke a claim for legitimate impediment based on his absence, according to reports. Berlusconi's next hearing for the tax fraud trial is set for April 11.

<p>While awaiting his tax fraud trial, Berlusconi first faces trial for <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">underage prostitution</a> [JURIST report] on April 6. Earlier this month, an Italian judge ordered Berlusconi to stand trial on charges of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of power. Berlusconi allegedly paid 7,000 euros to then 17-year-old dancer, Karima El Mahroug, for sex and later <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12083491">called police to secure her release</a> [BBC report] while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft.  The scandal has made Berlusconi the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/14/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSTRE71D1YN20110214">subject of protests</a> [Reuters] by hundreds of thousands of women, calling for his resignation over his recent sex scandal. Berlusconi, however, has refused to step down. Last week, Berlusconi solidified his intentions to remain in office by <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/index_2011_02_20.php#34545">pledging judicial reform</a> [JURIST report] and several other improvement he plans to make in Italy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] on whether the term "cocaine base" in the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/index.cfm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials] is limited to "crack" cocaine or encompasses all forms of cocaine chemically classified as a base. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/08-2101P-01A.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that "cocaine base" refers to "all forms of cocaine base, including, but not limited to crack cocaine." Counsel for the petitioner argued that Congress did not intend "cocaine base" to refer to the substances present in the middle of the crack-production process, saying:<blockquote>First of all, because Congress didn't use the term "cocaine," which is used elsewhere in the provision, it clearly meant a subset. It didn't mean all of the substances with the chemical formula that satisfies the chemical term "cocaine." Second of all, the statute shows just by the 100-to-1 ratio that Congress was focused on something that was especially dangerous, much more dangerous than powder. Third, the legislative context was, as the Court said in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-6330.ZS.html">Kimbrough</a>, that this was a statute that was enacted in response to a particular problem, and I think the question we're debating is: Would Congress have said, when it defined the term "cocaine base" ... that was used at the time to describe these categories of substances.</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued that whatever the term&#8212;freebase, coca paste or crack&#8212;"cocaine base" is the same chemically and smokeable. Further, that Congress did not limit the statute to just crack, one form of cocaine base, but all cocaine bases. The government also argued at "cocaine base" is a redundancy made by Congress to clarify the previously imprecise term "cocaine," used by the courts.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1159.pdf">Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University v. Roche Molecular Systems</a> [oral arguments transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-juvenile-miranda-rights.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the rights of universities under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Dole Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212] to inventions arising from federally funded research can be terminated by the individual inventors through separate agreements assigning the inventor's rights to a third party. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1509r.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Roche possesses an ownership interest in the patents at issue, depriving Stanford's standing to sue. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The inventor, because he is working here at the time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as an employee of Stanford University, is essentially working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to transfer title to his future invention to someone else because the statute has already spoken for it. ... [The general rule is] that inventors receive title. However ... the array of so-called vesting statutes that predicated the Bayh-Dole Act throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that specifically, in most instances without any discussion of an assignment, simply vested title directly in the United States. ... Congress clearly had the power to do that, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued that they couldn't.</blockquote> Counsel for the respondent accepted assertion that while the Bayh-Dole Act purported to put patents into the market, it did not change the long-standing rule "that title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to assignment, not in the inventor's employer." However, counsel for Stanford further argued that the Bayh-Dole act should be read straight-forwardly, and not in relation to the general rule. The respondent went on to say, "Congress worked a highly transformative change in the law of patent ownership and assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect way ... [creating] this brand-new vesting rule."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ejeie also stated that the opposition movement had transformed itself from "sedition to anti-revolution." Calls for Tuesday's protest were issued by the Green Path of Hope, an umbrella group for the Iranian opposition that was also responsible for protests held on February 14 and February 20. The opposition group has stated demonstrations will be held on March 15, if Mousavi and Karroubi remained in house arrest beyond March 1. 

<p>Earlier this month, Karroubi called for his own trial to be set up in a public court in an open letter to the head of the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/iran.htm">Supreme Judicial System of Iran</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder], <a href="http://www.dadiran.ir/">Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani</a> [official website, in Farsi].

The case was opened 14 years ago at the request of <a href="http://www.abuelas.org.ar/">Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish], and includes as defendants five military judges and a doctor who attended to the detainees.  The trial is expected to hear 370 witnesses and last up to a year.  With the help of the Grandmothers' DNA database, 102 people born to vanished detainees have recovered their true identities.  

<p>Argentina continues to prosecute those accused of committing human rights abuses during the Dirty War. In December, Videla was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/argentina-ex-dictator-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity. In June, trial proceedings were commenced for five ex-military officials allegedly responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">death of 65 left-wing activists</a> [JURIST report]. In May, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/argentina-ex-secret-agent-arrested-on-dirty-war-abuse-charges.php">Argentine authorities arrested</a> [JURIST report] former secret service agent Miguel Angel Furci on charges of human rights abuses. Furci, a former agent of the Secretariat of State Intelligence (SIDE), was charged with 70 kidnappings and the torture of detainees at Orletti. Also in May, the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-extradites-pilot-to-argentina-for-alleged-role-in-dirty-war.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] pilot Julio Alberto Poch to Argentina to face trial for his alleged role. Poch was a navy officer at Argentina's Naval Mechanics School, one of the most notorious detention centers of the military dictatorship, and is believed to have piloted flights known as "death flights," which were used to dump the military junta's political opponents into the Plata River and the Atlantic Ocean. In April, a federal court in Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/argentina-ex-president-sentenced-to-25.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former president and military general Bignone to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses during his 1982 to 1983 presidency. During the Dirty War, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or "disappeared" in a government-sponsored campaign against suspected dissidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government argues that Virginia, as a state, <a href="http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/state-news/2011/mar/01/tdmet03-us-files-response-in-vas-challenge-of-fede-ar-874203/">lacked standing to challenge the law</a> [<em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em> report] since the mandate applies only to individuals. The government then argues that, even if the state did have standing, Congress had the power to pass the law under the Constitution's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">commerce clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]:<blockquote>The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate conduct that substantially affects interstate commerce. As Congress found, the means of payment for services in the interstate health care market is economic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. The requirement that participants in the health care market have insurance to pay for the services they consume is thus a quintessential exercise of the commerce power. The regulation furthers two principal economic goals. First, it prevents the substantial cost-shifting in the interstate health care services market that results from the practice of consuming health care without insurance. Second, it is key to the viability of the Act's regulatory requirement that insurers not deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of an individual's medical condition or history.</blockquote>Finally, the government argues that the PPACA could also be upheld under Congress's taxing power. The administration claims that the individual mandate is essential to the PPACA's success. Virginia <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/">Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli</a> [official website] has until late March to file a response. Cuccinelli said he would not comment on the government's brief until he had more time to analyze it. The Fourth Circuit is <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2171285&t=Commonwealth-of-Virginia-v.-Sebelius">scheduled to hear the case</a> [materials] in May.

<p>In February, Cuccinelli <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed a writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking an expedited appeal. Cuccinelli announced his <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-to-ask-supreme-court-for-immediate-review-of-health-care-case.php">intention to appeal directly to the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month, citing the exceptionally far-reaching policy implications of the PPACA. There are currently 28 cases challenging the constitutionality of the PPACA. Federal courts in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">Washington, DC</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">Michigan</a> have upheld the law, while a federal court in <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] has also ruled the the individual mandate in unconstitutional, striking down the law in its entirety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Special judge PR Patel <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/godhra-case-court-rules-death-for-11-20-imprisoned-for-life/756263/0">handed down death sentences</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] for 11 of 31 convicted last week under the India Penal Code for murder, attempted murder and/or criminal conspiracy. The remaining 20 all received sentences of life imprisonment, and 63 others were acquitted. The convictions were for setting on fire the S6 coach of Sabarmati Express killing 59 people, mostly Vishwa Hindu Parishad members, returning from Ayodhya. The incident triggered riots in Gujarat in which more than 1,200 people were killed, mostly Muslims, in some of the worst violence between Hindus and Muslims in India since gaining independence in 1947. The prosecution had sought the death penalty for all 31 convicted. The defense <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Death-for-11-life-for-20-accused-in-Godhra-train-burning-case/articleshow/7600059.cms">plans to appeal</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] the death sentences and is prepared to take the matter to India's highest court.

<p>In May 2009, the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/india-high-court-orders-formation-of.php">ordered the formation</a> [JURIST report] of five special courts to hear cases stemming from the riots. The court did not move the cases outside of Gujarat however, as the <a href="http://nhrc.nic.in/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website] had <a href="http://nhrc.nic.in/GujratOrders.htm#no13">requested</a> [press release], instead <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/SC-fast-tracks-trial-of-Gujarat-riot-cases/articleshow/4470845.cms">ordering</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] that the courts be set up in the Ahmedabad, Anand, Sabarkanta, Gulbarga and Mehsana districts. In 2003, 12 Hindus were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for connection with murders occurring during religious riots in Gujarat. Violence between Muslims and Hindus in India has not subsided. Last week, the <a href="http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/">Bombay High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-appeals-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-mumbai-gunman.php">upheld the conviction and death sentence</a> [JURIST report] of Pakistani national <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab</a> [NDTV profile], the only surviving gunman of the three-day <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">siege of Mumbai</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+attack">news archive</a>] that killed 166 in November 2008. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Shinseki</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-veterans-benefits-sentencing.php">report</a>] that the 120-day statute of limitations for challenging a denial of veteran's benefits is not jurisdictional. In its decision, the court overruled the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which had <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-7006.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the holding of the US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that the 120-day period was jurisdictional and thus, not subject to equitable tolling. Both of the prior court decisions resulting in the dismissal of veteran Henderson's claim were based on the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-5306.ZS.html">Bowles v. Russell</a> [opinion text]. There, the court held that Bowles' untimely notice of appeal deprived the Sixth Circuit of jurisdiction as Congress had expressly provided a specific amount of time by which the district courts can extend the notice of appeal. In its decision today, the Supreme Court declined to follow the precedent in <span class="casename">Bowles</span>, distinguishing it from <span class="casename">Henderson</span> in that the former involved a review by Article III courts in the context of ordinary civil litigation, while the latter involved review by an Article I tribunal, which Congress created for the adjudication of veterans' benefits claims. Additionally, the court distinguished between the time limit provisions at issue in <span class="casename">Bowles</span> and similar cases and the one at issue in <span class="casename">Henderson</span>. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, stated: <blockquote>Because the time for taking an appeal from a district court to a court of appeals in a civil case has long been understood to be jurisdictional, this language clearly signals an intent to impose the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in this case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true that &#167; 7266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have rejected the notion that "all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are ... properly typed jurisdictional."</blockquote>Alito also supported the court's decision to limit the characterization of procedural rules as "jurisdictional" by discussing the consequences that attach to that label and the court's recent attempts to not refer to a rule as such "unless it governs a court's adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction." Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

<p>David Henderson was a veteran of the Korean War who received a 100 percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia from the VA in 1992. In 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care, which both the VA regional office and the Board of Appeals denied. Thereafter, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veteran's Court, but did so 15 days after the 120-day filing period. As a result of the late filing and his inability to attribute it to his illness, Henderson's appeal was dismissed. However, the Veteran's Court later granted Henderson's motion for reconsideration, but during this time, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <span class="casename">Bowles</span>, which the court found to be controlling, thereby dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, where a divided <em>en banc</em> court affirmed the previous decision of the Veteran's Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Proctor Hospital</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-video-game-law.php">report</a>] that an employer may be held liable for employment discrimination based on discriminatory motivations of a supervisor who influences, but does not necessarily make, the decision to fire an employee. Petitioner Vincent Staub served in the military while working for respondent Proctor Hospital. Staub's immediate supervisors were hostile to his military obligations which required him to miss work shifts. Staub's employment was terminated by the vice president of human resources, who was not biased against Staub's military obligations. Staub sued under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/usc/vpl/usc38.htm">Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994</a> (USERRA) [text] for wrongful termination. Proctor Hospital argued that, under the USERRA, an employer is not liable unless the <em>de facto</em> decisionmaker is motivated by discriminatory hostility. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=08-1316_017.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the unlawful intent of the officials who allegedly brought about Staub's dismissal could not be attributed to the employer on the basis that the vice president of human resources did not rely solely on the discriminatory motivations of Staub's supervisors in reaching her decision to terminate employment. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the "cat's paw" liability doctrine applies in this case:<blockquote>So long as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be liable under USERRA. And it is axiomatic under tort law that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does not prevent the earlier agent's action (and hence the earlier agent's discriminatory animus) from being the proximate cause of the harm.</blockquote>Given the lack of any principle in tort or agency law, the court says, a decisionmaker's independent investigation does not <em>per se</em> relieve the employer of fault. Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, agreeing with the reversal of the lower court's decision, but arguing that the reversal should have been based on textual interpretation of the statute rather than on principles of tort and agency law. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the decision.

<p>In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that the language of USERRA is similar to <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/2000e-16.htm">Title VII</a> [text], which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin, so the ruling will likely have implications in that context. Both statutes state that discrimination is established when one of those factors "was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." The Supreme Court has recently ruled on several other Title VII cases. Last month, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-rules-third-party-may-sue-employer-for-retaliation.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-291">Thompson v. North American Stainless</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a third party can sue his employer for retaliation. In June, the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-finds-no-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-441">Gross v. FBL Financial Services</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that age was the determining factor in an age discrimination in employment suit and that a mixed-motive jury instruction is never appropriate in such a case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI urged the interim government to immediately conduct a full investigation into the killings and allegations of serious abuse and hold the perpetrators accountable. The report reveals acts of brutality used by security forces, including shooting bystanders and fleeing protesters and firing at protesters who were not violent or threatening. According to the report, people detained by security forces were systematically beaten or subjected to other ill-treatment. AI's report states:<blockquote>Amnesty International calls on the Tunisian authorities to ensure that the investigation into the unrest is independent, transparent, thorough and impartial&#8212;and that the Commission's final report is promptly made public. Those identified as responsible for human rights abuses must be brought to justice in fair trials. Families of those unlawfully killed, as well as other victims of excessive use of force or torture and other ill-treatment at the hands of security forces, must be provided with adequate reparation including, but not limited to, financial compensation.</blockquote>AI called on Tunisia to conduct an independent investigation, publicly condemn torture and ill-treatment, provide victims of human rights violations with compensation and issue a formal apology.

The documents were sought by <a href="http://www.comptel.org/index.asp">CompTel</a> [association website], an industry association representing communications service providers, including some of AT&#38;T's competitors, as part of a request under FOIA.  AT&#38;T had argued that the "personal privacy" exemption applied to any legal "person," including corporations.  In an opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court disagreed:<blockquote>Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they acquire distinct meanings of their own. ... We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence, influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the word "personal" to describe them. ... We reject the argument that because "person" is defined for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase "personal privacy" in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations as well. The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law enforcement information on the ground that it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy does not extend to corporations.</blockquote>The court also noted that a similarly worded exception to FOIA referenced "personal and medical files" precluding the interpretation that it referred to corporations. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in deciding the case.

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-freedom-of-information-act.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January. Under exemption 7(C), an agency can withhold information pursuant to an FOIA request if that information can reasonably be believed to be a violation of "personal privacy." The issue of whether a corporation can be considered an individual for FOIA purposes has brought the court's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. FEC</a> [JURIST report] to the fore in the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202462348296&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1">minds of commentators</a> [NLJ report]. In that case, the court eased restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations, a decision that has been strongly opposed by the Obama administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Greene</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] and <span class ="casename">Alford v. Greene</span> on whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] requires a warrant, court order, parental consent or exigent circumstances to allow law enforcement and child welfare officials to conduct a temporary seizure and interview a child suspected of being sexually abused. The petitioners were co-defendants in a case involving a child who was temporary seized and interviewed at school regarding suspected abuse. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/12/10/06-35333.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that, despite the fact that there was a violation of an individual's constitutional rights, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity against the Fourth Amendment claims. Counsel for the petitioners argued that requiring a warrant or parental permission to question children about possible abuse places an unnecessary burden on child welfare workers, since "there are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse without speaking to the only witness that's typically available in the case ... the child." Counsel for the respondent replied that the case is moot because the child involved has grown up and no longer has a legal stake in the ruling.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-188.pdf">Schindler Elevator Corp. v. US ex rel. Kirk</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/supreme-court-adds-14-cases-to-2010-docket.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on whether a federal agency's response to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=freedom+of+information+act">news archive</a>] request is a "report ... or investigation" within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sec_31_00003730----000-.html">False Claims Act public disclosure bar</a> [31 USC &#167; 3730(e)(4)]. The case involves a former Schindler employee who filed a lawsuit against the company based on information made public under FOIA. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9964a2e0-1216-4de3-a1fe-ae3940a0e8e0/1/doc/09-1678-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9964a2e0-1216-4de3-a1fe-ae3940a0e8e0/1/hilite/">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the FOIA information was not a report or investigation under the statute and was not barred from litigation. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the circuit court decision opens the door to "a host of lawsuits by relators with no meaningful information to contribute," which is a situation that the public disclosure bar was created to prevent. In response, counsel for the respondent argued that Schindler's overly broad application of the public disclosure bar harms the policy goal of "encourag[ing] whistleblowers specifically to use government records in their investigations" under the False Claims Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling upheld the conviction <em>in absentia</em> due to Rainsy self-imposed exile since 2005. At the hearing, Rainsy's representative <a href = "http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011022346952/National-news/high-court-hears-rainsy-case.html">read a statement</a> [<em>Phnom Penh Post</em> report] where Rainsy declared the issue political, not penal. The court was unconvinced, declaring there was <a href = "http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011030147070/National-news/opposition-leader-loses-final-appeal.html">enough evidence against Rainsey</a> [<em>Phnom Penh Post report</em>], and that he intentionally incited racial discrimination. In reaction to his conviction, an e-mail from Rainsy stated: "I am sure the government will show a minimum of consistency by dropping its ridiculous complaint against me and by stopping blatantly using the politically subservient court in trying to silence me." Rainsy also released an <a href = "http://www.samrainsyparty.org/archives/achieve_2011/02/110221_THE%20CAMBODIAN%20GOVERNMENT%20MUST%20EARN%20THE%20RESPECT.htm">open letter</a> [text] to the Cambodian government on the <a href = "http://www.samrainsyparty.org/">Sam Rainsy Party</a> (SRP) [party website] the day of the deliberation.

<p>Rainsy was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-opposition-leader-convicted-over-vietnam-border-controversy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <em>in absentia</em> in September to 10 years in prison for <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/cambodia-opposition-leader-faces-new.php">charges of forging and disseminating a false map</a> [JURIST report] of the Cambodia-Vietnam border on his political party's website. The <a href = "http://www.samrainsyparty.org/archives/achieve_2010/Border%20posts/Border%20posts.pdf">map</a> [document, PDF], posted on the SRP website, shows an area along the border of the two countries in which Rainsy alleges the Vietnamese government tampered with four border posts, placing them further into Cambodian territory than UN, US Army, Google and French colonial maps specify. The Cambodian government has never released an official map of the country, although they promised to release one in 2012. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/28/cambodia-opposition-leader-sam-rainsy-s-trial-farce">called</a> [press release] the closed-door trial of Sam Rainsy and two villagers a "farce," saying the ruling demonstrates the government's control over the country's judiciary.

The <a href = "http://www.wseu-24.org/">Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24</a> (WSUE) [advocacy website] filed the petition earlier in the day in reaction to <a href = "http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] ordering the capitol building closed and removing protesters on Sunday. At that time, protesters had been occupying the premises for 14 days. The <a href = "http://www.doa.state.wi.us/">Department of Administration</a> (DOA) [official website] released <a href = "http://capaccess.blogspot.com/2011/03/building-procedures-for-wisconsin-state.html">new regulations</a> [press release] for admittance to the capitol building: opening one entrance open to the general public where visitors may be admitted one-by-one, creating a prohibition on sleeping bags and blankets and declaring an ability to limit the number of protesters. In response to the injunction, the DOA <a href = "http://capaccess.blogspot.com/2011/03/information-on-temporary-injunction.html">stated</a> [press release] that they were in compliance with the order by allowing the capitol building open during normal business hours, despite restrictions. The hearing on the temporary injunction will <a href = "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_fed3c5b0-4486-11e0-8a0e-001cc4c03286.html">continue Wednesday morning</a> [<em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> report], with a final decision expected later that day.

<p>Protests in Wisconsin have been in effect since February 15, when a committee on behalf of Walker released <a href = "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/JR1SB-11.pdf">Senate Bill 11</a> [text, PDF] to address the state's $3.6 billion deficit. The bill would require state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and would eliminate the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increase, which would be capped by the Consumer Price Index. These provisions incensed unions and their supporters, sparking the protests. The <a href = "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/">Wisconsin State Assembly</a> [official website] passed the bill in a vote of 51-17. The bill has yet to be voted on in the Senate, due to the 14 Democrat senators relocating to Illinois as a form of protest. Without them, the Senate is only at 19 members, one short for a quorum, which is required to hold a vote on a fiscal bill. Walker continues to push for his budget proposal, <a href = "http://walker.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?prid=5668&locid=177">speaking on it earlier today</a> [transcript], and threatening to <a href = "http://walker.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?prid=5660&locid=177">cut Democrat-approved portions out</a> [press release] if Democrats do not return to vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 5(2) of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:373:0037:0043:EN:PDF">Directive 2004/113/EC</a> [text, PDF] provides that, notwithstanding rules in the directive prohibiting discrimination, EU states may "permit proportionate differences in individuals' premiums and benefits where the use of sex is a determining factor in the assessment of risk based on relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data." The ECJ found this exception incompatible with Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter, which prohibit discrimination based on sex and mandate equal treatment of men and women. The court held:<blockquote>Such a provision, which enables the Member States in question to maintain without temporal limitation an exemption from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits, works against the achievement of the objective of equal treatment between men and women, which is the purpose of Directive 2004/113, and is incompatible with Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter.</blockquote>Consumer group <a href="http://www.test-achats.be/">Test-Achats</a> [advocacy website, in French], which brought the case, <a href="http://www.test-achats.be/assurances/assurances-et-discrimination-le-principe-d-egalite-des-sexes-est-absolu-s707083.htm">said the decision</a> [press release, in French] is "[a] victory for consumers, men and women, across the EU, one more victory for Test-Achats in its fight against discrimination in insurance."

The judgment gives member states and insurance companies until December 21, 2012, to end disparate pricing.

Phelps</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] protections extend to protesters at military funerals. Reverend Fred Phelps and members of the <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [WARNING: readers may find material at this church website offensive; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=westboro">news archive</a>] have been traveling around the country picketing military funerals in recent years, claiming US soldiers have been killed because America tolerates homosexuals. The <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-lawsuit-filed-against-military.php">suit was brought</a> [JURIST report] by the family of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder after Phelps and members of his church picketed his funeral. In the 8-1 decision, the court held that the First Amendment shields the church from tort liability because the protests fell under the protected category of "public speech." In concluding that the church's speech was public speech, the court examined the content, form and context of the speech. The majority found that the content of the speech was clearly public because it related to "broad issues of interest to society at large," including the "political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens." The court also determined that the form and context of the protests indicate that the they fall under the public speech category because the protests took place on public property, the protesters were in compliance with local ordinances, and because there was no preexisting relationship between the church and the Snyder family that would indicate a private matter.  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts stated:<blockquote>Given that Westboro's speech was at a public place on a matter of public concern, that speech is entitled to special protection under the First Amendment. Such speech cannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or arouses contempt. If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.</blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer authored a concurring opinion. Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion stating that "the First Amendment does not entirely preclude liability for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by means of speech." Alito concluded that the church's speech went beyond public speech by specifically attacking Matthew Snyder, and was therefore not entitled to First Amendment protection.

<p>The court's ruling affirmed a <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.P.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website], which held that Phelps' speech was protected by the First Amendment. The Fourth Circuit overturned a lower court decision which <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-jury-orders-military-funeral.php">awarded the family</a> [JURIST report] almost $11 million in damages. At oral arguments, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-military-funeral-protests.php">counsel for the petitioner argued</a> [JURIST report] that the court should place an emphasis on the context of the speech in light of the fact that the protests took place at a military funeral. Counsel for the church argued that, because Snyder had turned his son's funeral into a public event, the church's actions were protected because they were speaking on a matter of public concern. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Harris argued that the appeal is unlikely to succeed in light of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">jurisdictional concerns</a> [JURIST report] and the recent US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] to stop defending the constitutionality of portions of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] on the grounds that laws concerning sexual orientation should be subject to a higher standard of review. Harris also questioned the rationality of continuing to enforce the stay, noting that the measure's supporters would not be subjected to harm if the order was lifted, whereas same-sex couples seeking to marry may face violations of their constitutional rights so long as the stay remains effective. A three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">issued the stay</a> [JURIST report] in August.  

<p>After being <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] by the Ninth Circuit to weigh in, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR04-11.PDF">announced</a> [release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/california-supreme-court-agrees-to-rule-on-prop-8-standing-issue.php">report</a>] last month that it will decide whether supporters of Proposition 8 have standing to defend the measure when state officials have refused to do so. When Judge Vaughn Walker of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] struck down Proposition 8, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report], leaving defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Project Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law. In January, the Ninth Circuit also <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/04/1016751op.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision refusing to allow officials from <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-county-commences-appeal-of-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">Imperial County, California</a> [JURIST report] to intervene, and Judge Stephen Reinhardt issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/04/1016696memo.pdf">memorandum opinion</a> [text, PDF] on his <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-judge-declines-to-recuse-himself-from-propositon-8-case.php">decision not to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Ninth Circuit heard <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_vid=0000006121">oral arguments</a> [video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">report</a>] in the case, <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000472">Perry v.

The hearing was divided into two one-hour sessions, with the first section focusing on the issue of standing and the second on Proposition 8's constitutionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/3EEE2E2A-2618-4D66-8ECB-C95BECCC300C.htm">statement</a> [press release], ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] will make a formal announcement of the investigation Thursday. The <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] enables the ICC to proceed with an investigation unless the crimes committed do not fall under the court's jurisdiction. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/116663/20110227/un-resolution-libya-sanctions-original-text-un-resolution-1970-2011.htm">Resolution 1970</a> [text] gives the ICC jurisdiction over the current situation in Libya. During a press conference Thursday at The Hague, Ocampo will present information regarding individuals in Libya who can be prosecuted. The ICC's statement says: <blockquote>The Office of the Prosecutor is liaising with the United Nations, the African Union, the Arab League, as well as States. Additionally, the Prosecutor will also request information from other sources including from Interpol who will provide assistance. The Prosecutor will act independently and impartially. The next step is for the Prosecutor to present his case to ICC judges who will then decide whether or not to issue arrest warrants based on the evidence.</blockquote>Depending on the ICC's findings during investigation, warrants maybe issued against individuals involved with the violence Libya. 

<p>On Saturday, the UN Security Council voted <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37633&Cr=Libya&Cr1=">unanimously</a> [press release] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">impose sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Libyan leader  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], marking the first unanimous referral to the ICC in UN history. Resolution 1970 also received support from Libya's delegation itself, which <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110225/wl_nm/us_libya_rights_envoy">renounced Gaddafi on Friday</a> [Reuters report]. Subsequently, the UN General Assembly voted Tuesday to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi.

The suit was filed 10 years ago by a group of female employees claiming systemic discrimination against the company's female associates across the country. The female plaintiffs claim that Wal-Mart violated <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act</a> [materials] because they were paid lower wages and given fewer promotions than their less qualified male counterparts.  The brief states that sex stereotypes and subjective decision-making practices led to discrimination against women. Examples of sex stereotyping in the brief include: managers stating that they believed women were not the breadwinners for their family so they deserved to earn less, that they should be limited to family caretaking roles and that women should be assigned limited roles within the company. The brief also accuses of Wal-Mart being a "boys club": <blockquote>One woman attested that workers must be part of the "informal network versus the formal network" to be successful because Wal-Mart is "a very cli[que]-oriented environment" in which women were referred to as "girls" and "Janie Qs." Another woman reported that her manager "ran the store like a boys' club" in which male managers regularly socialized with male hourly workers, leaving her to run the store. Another was told by a senior vice president that she would not advance because she did not "hunt, fish, or do other typically-male activities" with the "boys" in the company and was not "a part of the boys club." [Another] woman employee was told that promotion was based on "whom you knew, not what you knew"</blockquote> The brief also argues that a class action lawsuit is necessary to overcome challenges faced by the plaintiffs in finding information about wages, to pool together their resources so they could afford to bring the lawsuit, and to protect them against retaliation. 

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-to-hear-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-global-warming-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in Wal-Mart v. Dukes in December 2010. The court is set to determine whether claims for monetary relief can be certified under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)</a> [text] and whether the class certification ordered under this rule was consistent with FRCP 23(a). The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010. The class is estimated to include more than 1.5 million women employed by Wal-Mart since December 26, 1998, which makes it the largest class action lawsuit in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-98.pdf">Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-to-her-Ashcroft-immunity-appeal.php">report</a>], former US attorney general <a href="/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">John Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive], appealed the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail18.html">absolute</a> and <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail21.html">qualified</a> [AELE backgrounders] immunity do not shield him from suit alleging that he utilized a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3144.html">material witness warrant</a> [18 USC &#167; 3144 text] as a pretext to investigate and detain an individual whom the government never planned to call as a witness. Counsel for Ashcroft argue that the appellate court's ruling is contrary to precedent that states that intent plays no role in finding that absolute immunity applies to traditional prosecutorial functions, such as issuing material witness warrants. Petitioner also asserts that, regardless of the finding on absolute immunity, qualified immunity protects officials unless their actions violate constitutional rights, which Ashcroft argues does not occur by using a material witness warrant in a pretextual manner. Counsel for respondent, an American citizen who was detained pursuant to a material witness warrant later found to be factually inaccurate, argue that qualified immunity does not apply because the detention violated al-Kidd's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. Respondent further argues that absolute immunity does not protect those who would use the material witness warrant to investigate an individual, and that the attorney general should not be permitted to claim greater immunity than the FBI agents that carried out his instructions. During argument, counsel for al-Kidd, when questioned whether anytime someone held under a material witness warrant was not called to testify, that person could bring suit, replied in the negative, suggesting that an allegation would need to contain more than a bare allegation, and that "I think that's what we have done."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-10876.pdf">Bullcoming v. New Mexico</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court will decide whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] permits the prosecution to introduce testimonial statements of a nontestifying forensic analyst through the in-court testimony of a supervisor or other person who did not perform or observe the laboratory analysis described in the statements. Petitioner Donald Bullcoming, convicted in state court of driving while intoxicated, appealed the New Mexico Supreme Court decision holding that a forensic supervisor can testify in court as to the analysis and report of a technician who did not testify. Counsel for Bullcoming relies on the Supreme Court's recent decision in <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/forensic-lab-reports-are-testimonial.php">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> [JURIST report], which held that a forensic analyst's report is "testimonial evidence" and thus the analyst is subject to cross-examination. Counsel for respondent argue that the forensic test was performed by a machine, distinguishing <span class="casename">Melendez-Diaz</span>, and that because a witness with knowledge of laboratory procedure and the functioning of the machine was provided, there is no constitutional violation. During argument, the justices repeatedly questioned counsel for New Mexico regarding their assertion that there is a difference between an affidavit offered by an analyst, as in <span class="casename">Melendez-Diaz</span>, and a purely machine-produced report. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, focusing on the certification of both documents, pressed counsel as to how they could be considered distinguishable, saying, "I'm sorry, could you tell me what that means? Why is it different than the affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an attestation as to the truth of the statements contained therein. That's the common definition." Justice Antonin Scalia, focusing on the fact that the analyst had been placed on leave without pay during the trial, stated perhaps the most important reason why the defendant should have been permitted to cross examine the analyst, "Does the defense know why it was leave without pay? Could the defense have found out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave without pay because he was&#8212;had shown himself to be incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be important to the defense?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government requested that the <a href="http://www.codex-online.com/codex/contents.nsf/WPrintArticles/EC4A122CBC22CC90C22577E4005B2FBD/$file/Chamber+judgment+Greens+and+M.T.+v.+the+UK+23.11.10.pdf">ECHR decision</a> [press release, PDF] in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=877343&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Greens and MT v. the United Kingdom</a> [judgment text] be appealed to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The+Court/The+Court/The+Grand+Chamber/">Grand Chamber</a> [official website] of the court, believing it may reverse the precedent that grants prisoners the right to vote. Greens, a UK prisoner convicted of rape, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12535440">commenced an appeal</a> [BBC report] last week to ensure his right to vote before the upcoming May elections. A panel of five judges will ultimately decide whether to refer the decision to the Grand Chamber. Last month, the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-parliament-rejects-prisoner-voting-rights-despite-echr-ruling.php">voted to reject the ECHR ruling</a> [JURIST report] and continue preventing prisoners from voting in British elections. The UK <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12625111">plans to argue</a> [BBC report] that the court should consider the vote and clarify the contradictory case law. In the written answer, <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/mark-harper-minister-political-and-constitutional-reform">Cabinet Office Minister Mark Harper</a> [official profile] said:<blockquote>The Government has requested that the court's judgment in the "Greens and MT" case be referred to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) - the highest tier of the ECHR. If the Grand Chamber agrees to the referral, they will look again at the judgment and issue their opinion. The basis of the Government's referral request is that we believe that the court should look again at the principles in "Hirst" which outlaws a blanket ban on prisoners voting, particularly given the recent debate in the House of Commons. The referral request also points out the need for clarity in the ECHR's case law in this area.</blockquote>The controversy over UK prisoner voting rights stems from a 2005 case filed by John Hirst, who had been sentenced to life in prison for killing his landlord. Hirst claimed he should be able to vote while in prison and the ECHR agreed, <a href="http://www.unlock.org.uk/userfiles/file/Votes/Hirst%20v%20UK%20Grand%20Chamber%20Judgement%206%20Oct%202005.pdf">ruling</a> [judgment] that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/schedule2/ccrorder45.htm">Representation of the People Act of 1983</a> [text] breached Hirst's human rights. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12522239">recent disagreement</a> [BBC report] with the ECHR invoked outrage in the UK and generated proposals for a British Bill of Rights by various members of the British government. Last week, former UK Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf warned that a British Bill of Rights would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-judge-warns-proposed-bill-of-rights-could-further-conflict-between-uk-echr.php">conflict</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which the UK has incorporated into its law. While the government has not stated an intention to withdraw from the convention, Woolf has warned that continued adherence to the convention combined with the creation of a British Bill of Rights would create complications for judges in determining which to follow and further the existing conflict between the UK and the ECHR. The UK currently incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into its law, but the ECHR has the final interpretation. Also in February, UK think tank <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/">Policy Exchange</a> [think tank website] <a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/pdfs/PX_Keeping_Human_Rights_at_Home_WEB_07_02_11.pdf">called for the UK to withdraw from the ECHR</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-urged-to-withdraw-from-europe-rights-court.php">report</a>] in favor of a domestic high court. The report proposes that the UK to try to negotiate reforms with the court to limit its jurisdiction, and, if unsuccessful, suggests that the UK consider withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the ECHR altogether. Following, the Supreme Court in London would be the final appellate court for human rights law, with no right to appeal to the ECHR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bhatti, a member of Pakistan's Christian minority and outspoken critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12617562">killed Tuesday while traveling to work</a> [BBC report] when gunmen opened fire on his vehicle. <a href="http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/the-pakistan-taliban-2489/">Tehrik-i-Taliban</a> [Geopolitical Monitor backgrounder] later said that it carried out the attack. "I urge the Government of Pakistan to honour the courageous stand of Mr. Bhatti and Mr. Taseer by supporting their position on the blasphemy laws." Pillay said in a statement. "To do otherwise will simply encourage similar acts of violence and lawlessness as a means of scaring governments off from making much needed human rights reforms. Murderers should not be rewarded by getting what they want, in terms of government policy." 

<p>Last month, a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-indictment-over-blasphemy-law-assassination.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] police guard Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, accused of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/pakistan-governor-opposing-blasphemy-law-assassinated.php">assassinating</a> [JURIST report] liberal politician and governor of Pakistan's Punjab province Salman Taseer for opposing the nation's blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year. Tasseer had spoken in Bibi's defense. In December, the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> (LHC) [official website] ordered a stay against any amendments to Pakistan's blasphemy laws pending further proceedings. The blasphemy laws were introduced in 1986 as a way of protecting Muslim beliefs from insults. In response to the repeated calls for repeal, Pakistani Federal Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti has said the laws may be amended to prevent misuse, but they will not be repealed. Advocacy groups such as <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hrw-urges-repeal-of-pakistan-blasphemy-laws.php">Human Rights Watch</a> [JURIST report], as well as LHC advocate <a href="/forum/2010/11/no-space-for-democracy-and-rule-of-law-blasphemy-laws-in-pakistan.php">Saroop Ijaz</a> [JURIST op-ed] have called for the laws to be repealed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Moreno-Ocampo, "the office of the prosecutor decided to open an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed in Libya" based on reports of brutal treatment of "peaceful demonstrators" by Libyan security forces dating back to February 15. Moreno-Ocampo specifically identified Gaddafi, his sons and his political allies as targets of the investigation and warned Libyan officials  that complicity in such abuses would result in prosecution. "In the coming weeks, the office will investigate who are the most responsible for the most egregious incidents," and ICC judges will issue warrants for parties implicated in the probe, said Moreno-Ocampo. "This is a court of justice. Judges will decide."  The <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] enables the ICC to proceed with an investigation unless the crimes committed do not fall under the court's jurisdiction. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/116663/20110227/un-resolution-libya-sanctions-original-text-un-resolution-1970-2011.htm">Resolution 1970</a> [text] gives the ICC jurisdiction over the current situation in Libya. 

<p>On Saturday, the UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37633&Cr=Libya&Cr1=">voted unanimously</a> [press release] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">impose sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Gaddafi, marking the first unanimous referral to the ICC in UN history. Resolution 1970 also received support from Libya's delegation itself, which <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110225/wl_nm/us_libya_rights_envoy">renounced Gaddafi on Friday</a> [Reuters report]. The UN General Assembly voted Tuesday to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi.

The suit, filed in the <a href = "http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], alleges that Afifi's rights were violated when FBI agents attempted to retrieve their tracking device, without explanation for why Afifi was being tracked. Afifi's suit alleges civil rights and constitutional violations, specifically unlawful search under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">Fourth Amendment</a> [text], chilling and recording of First Amendment activities, and unlawful agency action:<blockquote>Defendants' unlawful intrusions into Mr. Afifi's life&#8212;initiated as a result of his heritage, lawful associations, and disclosed political views&#8212;create an objective chill on Mr. Afifi's First Amendment activities. In addition to the fear Mr. Afifi now feels when expressing his political views and maintaining certain lawful associations, Defendants' actions have deterred others from associating with him, prospective employers most notably. The existence&#8212;even if now in the past&#8212;of an intensive surveillance operation by Defendants of Mr. Afifi communicate to persons and organizations that Mr. Afifi is at least suspect if not a threat to the physical security of those in my proximity.</blockquote>Afifi's family resides in Egypt, and he makes frequent trips and phone calls to the Middle East, which he <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=134207567">described</a> [<em>NPR</em> report] as fitting the FBI's "profile." FBI spokesperson <a href = "http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/executives/kortan">Michael Kortan</a> [official profile] maintained that the FBI conducts all of its investigations under <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and FBI guidelines. Afifi seeks an injunction ending the FBI's investigation of him, a declaratory judgment that his rights were violated, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, and damages for emotional distress.

<p>The use of GPS technology and other <a href = "/currentawareness/surveillance.php">surveillance devices</a> [JURIST news archive] by law enforcement agents has been a controversial issue in the US, with courts across the country coming to divergent conclusions. In December, the DC District Court <A href = "/paperchase/2010/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-ruling-against-warrantless-gps-tracking-to-stand.php">declined to rehear en banc</a> [JURIST report] a bid by the DOJ to overturn a decision that prevents the government from using GPS technology to track suspects without a warrant. A Pennsylvania appeals court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/pennsylvania-appeals-court-allows-evidence-obtained-with-gps-technology.php">allowed use of evidence obtained with GPS technology</a> [JURIST report] in December. In September, a three-judge panel for the <a href = "http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that at times the government might need a warrant to obtain <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/pennsylvania-appeals-court-allows-evidence-obtained-with-gps-technology.php">cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. Last year, the US Supreme Court unanimously held that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an employer's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">search of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The arrests were carried out in conjunction with police raids in Ankara and Istanbul, during which authorities copied computer hard drives and confiscated notes from suspects' homes. The investigation's targets are suspected of having ties to the Ergenekon plot, an alleged plan to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website]. Among those <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110303/ap_on_re_eu/eu_turkey_coup_plot">detained</a> [AP report] were Nedim Sener, an investigative reporter for two major Turkish newspapers, and Dogan Yurdakul and Mumtaz Idil, employees of <a href="http://www.odatv.com/">Oda TV</a> [media website, in Turkish], an online news website that had been critical of the Turkish government and whose owner was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/turkish-authorities-jail-journalists-over-alleged-coup-plot-ties.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] along with two other journalists last month.

<p>US officials <a href="http://turkey.usembassy.gov/statements_021611.html">voiced concerns</a> [statement] last month over the treatment of journalists in Turkey, while Turkish officials have warned other countries not to become involved in their domestic matters. In June, a Turkish criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 33 retired and active naval officers accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule as part of the Ergenekon plot. The Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-authorities-charge-33-for.php">indicted the 33 defendants</a> [JURIST report] in March on charges of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule. Also in March, Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-arrests-20-more-in.php">detained 20 people</a> in connection with the plot, and Turkish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon and plotting to overthrow the AKP. The Ergenekon investigation has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the opposition and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report] on secular Turkey. Trials against the Ergenekon group <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">started</a> [JURIST report] two years ago, and nearly 200 people have been charged in connection with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In January, Judge Roger Vinson voided the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) upon ruling that requiring all Americans over the age of 18 to have health insurance violated the Constitution by exceeding Congress' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] power. The stay will allow the administration to continue its implementation of the law in other states until after appellate review. The administration had not formally sought a stay on the injunction, but rather had requested Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">"clarify"</a> [JURIST report] his earlier judgment in order to determine its "potential impact" on the implementation of the Act. In his clarification order, Vinson reprimanded the administration for not filing a formal motion, but agreed to stay the injunction in order to expedite the appellate review:<blockquote>In the time since [the litigation was filed], the battle lines have been drawn, the relevant case law marshaled, and the legal arguments refined. Almost everyone agrees that the Constitutionality of the Act is an issue that will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is very important to everyone in this country that this case move forward as soon as practically possible.</blockquote>The administration must file its notice of appeal and seek an expedited review from the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] before March 10. 

<p>The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges across the country. There are currently cases in 28 states challenging the provisions of the PPACA and the lower court rulings on issues surrounding the legislation have been mixed. Last month, <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] for a <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/24454%20pdf%20McCullough.pdf">writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] rules on the issue. In January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Divjak was arrested Thursday night at Vienna International Airport while traveling from Sarajevo to Italy, and he appeared Friday morning before a local judge who <a href="http://www.tanjug.rs/vest.asp?id=8884">placed him in extradition custody</a> [<em>Tanjug</em> report, in Serbian]. Under Austrian law, Divjak will <a href="http://noe.orf.at/stories/502330/">remain in custody for 14 days</a> [ORF report, in German] while the court reviews evidence and determines whether to allow extradition. Serbian officials believe that Divjak was involved in a May 1992 attack that <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/pejic_bosnia_commentary/2328106.html">killed up to 40 retreating soldiers</a> [RFE/FL report] during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnia+civil+war">1992-1995 Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a unique situation, Divjak, who is ethnically Serbian, left the Yugoslav army during the war and enlisted with the Bosnian forces. He has since <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4Y3vE8XMyNnJZrlwhQ-0Yc3KEQQ?docId=94e9be38d93b4cf89af178639b08259e">gained popularity</a> [AP report] in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for his belief in a "multiethnic Bosnia" and his charity work for children. Some commentators predict that Serbia will have difficulty extraditing Divjak from Austria, drawing parallels to the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-blocks-extradition-of-former-bosnia-president.php">failed extradition</a> [JURIST report] last year of former Bosnian president <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=ejup_ganic_919&cHash=cc93a7abd0&L=5">Ejup Ganic</a> [Trial Watch profile] from the UK to stand trial for alleged war crimes in Serbia.

<p>Divjak's arrest is part of Serbian officials' ongoing effort to apprehend those responsible for the atrocities that occurred in the region during the 1992-95 civil war. Last month, French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/france-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-massacre-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Milorad Momic, a suspected former member of the Serbian paramilitary group, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scorpions">Scorpions</a> [JURIST news archive], which took part in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] in Bosnia, where a total of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed. Since his arrest, both <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/croatia-serbia-seek-extradition-of-war-crimes-suspect.php">Croatian and Serbian officials have requested his extradition</a> [JURIST report] to face trial for war crimes charges filed against him in each country. Suspected BiH war criminal Dragan Crnogorac was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November in connection with the Srebrenica massacre. In August, the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">Court of BiH</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bosnia-court-indicts-military-officers-for-genocide-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">issued genocide charges</a> [JURIST report] against four former Bosnian Serb soldiers, accusing them of participating in the murder of more than 800 Bosnian Muslims during the massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to the waiting period, <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">HB 1217</a> [legislative materials] would require that pregnant women receive consultation at a "pregnancy help center" and that the women's doctors verify that this consultation occurred by asking the women for the name of the counselor and the name, address and phone number of the center. The bill also mandates that the content of the consultation be to, "inform her about what education, counseling, and other assistance is available to help the pregnant mother keep and care for her child, and have a private interview." The bill additionally allows for such centers to be listed on a South Dakota <a href="http://doh.sd.gov/">Department of Health</a> [official website] registry, provided that one of the principal missions of the center be, "to educate, counsel, and otherwise assist women to help them maintain their relationship with their unborn children." The bill has <a href="http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=7915&Itemid=57">drawn the ire of pro-choice groups</a> [KDLT report] in the state and around the country, which have <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/enough-enough-latest-south-dakota-attack-women-s-access-abortion-goes-too-">called the proposed law</a> [ACLU press release] an "outragreous and extreme measure" and a "detriment to women's healthcare." South Dakota <a href="http://sd.gov/governor/Default.aspx">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] has indicated that he will review the bill, but is <a href="http://www.ksfy.com/Global/story.asp?S=14183548">inclined to sign the measure</a> [KSFY report].

<p>South Dakota's proposed law is just one of many new laws regulating abortion that have appeared at both the state and federal levels in recent months. In late February, the Kansas House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would restrict abortions after the 20-week time point. Nebraska had <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010. Earlier last month, the US House of Representatives proposed a budget which would <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/03/03/sen_kerry_defends_fed_funds_to_planned_parenthood/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Local+news">deny all funding to Planned Parenthood</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report]. In May 2010, the Oklahoma Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire, including their reasons for seeking the abortion. Oklahoma's governor vetoed that bill, but both chambers of the state legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-legislature-overrides-veto-of-pre-abortion-questionaire-bill.php">voted to override the veto</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pending-appeal-delays-closing-trial-of-former-liberian-president.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] closing arguments last month in order to let the defense appeal a ruling that denied admission of a defense document due to untimely filing. The court's decision to postpone closing arguments was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/closing-arguments-begin-in-trial-of-former-liberian-president-taylor-enters.php">preceded by a boycott of the proceedings</a> [JURIST report] by Taylor and his lawyers in protest of the court's decision to refuse to accept a written defense brief that was filed 20 days late. The appeals chamber decision rests on the concern that Taylor did not understand that the legal consequence of his lawyer's decision to walk out of the trial was a waiver of his right to give closing arguments. The court expressed its concerns for fundamental fairness and justice if it could not be establish that Taylor "knowing[ly], intellig[ibly] and voluntar[ily]" waived his right to present a closing argument:<blockquote>Had it been established that the Accused understood and agreed with the representations of the actions of his Counsel ... then there would have been no error in concluding that the Accused has forfeited his opportunity to file a final trial brief. ... However, in the face of the silence of the Accused, ... the conclusion that the Accused had waived his right to have his final argument considered was an error of fact, which, if uncorrected, could occasion a miscarriage of justice. To rule otherwise would be to disadvantage the uninformed Accused for the actions of his Counsel, which would be unfair, particular as there are other means by which the Trial Chamber can sanction Counsel without affecting the Accused's fundamental rights.</blockquote>Taylor's lawyer now faces disciplinary sanctions for last month's walkout and, arguably, for his misrepresentation of Taylor's instructions to do so. The appeals chamber also instructed the trial court to expeditiously set a date for the closing arguments. 

<p>Taylor is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied all allegations</a> [JURIST report] against him. Charges <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">include</a> [indictment, PDF] murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism, all stemming from from a "campaign to terrorize the civilian population" of Sierra Leone. Taylor's defense lawyers, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">began presenting their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009, have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia. His trial continued after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-denies.php">denied his motion for acquittal</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. Although Taylor's trial is coming to an end, prosecutors previously expressed concern that the defense's list of 256 witnesses could make the trial last up to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-warns-taylor-trial-at.php">four additional years</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Fletcher Dawson said that Abdelhaleem still <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/article/948863--life-in-prison-for-toronto-18-member?bn=1">posed a substantial risk to the public</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] and has not shown remorse for his part in the failed terrorist plot to enact a series of violent attacks on civilians, public officials and government buildings. Abdelhaleem, the first adult of the group to be tried, allegedly <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crime/article/749522---toronto-18-trial-three-men-a-table-and-dreams-of-gold">planned to profit from the attacks</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] by buying and selling certain stocks before the bombings. Before being convicted in January 2010, Abdelhaleem <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/toronto-18-member-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report], arguing that he was entrapped by Shaher Elsoheny, his former classmate who worked as a police informant and <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/03/04/an-unacceptable-risk-to-society-final-toronto-18-member-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/">provided intelligence</a> [<em>National Post</em> report] against Abdelhaleem and others that eventually led to the arrests.

<p>The accused leader of the terrorist group, Zakaria Amara, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/accused-toronto-18-leader-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 to charges of planning to bomb three targets in Ontario. The same month, another member of the group, Ali Mohamed Dirie, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his part in the plot, while another, Saad Gaya, pleaded guilty. In September, the first of the group to plead guilty, Saad Khalid, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">14 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], though the Canadian government is seeking to alter that sentence for time already served. The first of the suspects to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/canada-convicts-first-defendant-under.php">convicted under Canada's post-9/11 terrorism law</a> was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/canada-court-sentences-and-releases.php">sentenced and released</a> [JURIST reports] in May, with the court citing time served.

The few exceptions include places of worship, the home and while traveling as a passenger in a car. Critics of the ban have accused French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/le-president-de-la-republique/nicolas-sarkozy-biographie/nicolas-sarkozy-biographie-officielle.482.html">President Nicholas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">profile</a>] of <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/03/04/Frances-veil-ban-effective-in-April/UPI-71011299247319/">pandering to right-wing voters</a> [UPI report] in anticipation of the upcoming regional elections.

In July, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with 2 abstaining.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new indictment carries more severe charges than the <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/27938/loughner-indictment.pdf">original indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/accused-arizona-gunman-indicted.php">report</a>] filed in January, accounting for all victims of the attack and carrying more serious penalties. The previous indictment received <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/us/05loughner.html">criticism</a> [NYT report] because some people felt that it ignored many of the victims, focusing only on the attempted murder of <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AR) [official website]. The new charges also include the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000245----000-.html">murder of participants of a federal activity</a> [18 USC &#167; 245(b)(1)(B) text]. If the court convicts Loughner on that charge, it would be expanding the definition of a "federal activity" over past interpretations to include activities like the "Congress on your Corner" event Giffords was hosting, a possible weakness in the prosecution's case.

<p>Prosecutors first <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">filed charges against Loughner</a> [JURIST report] in January. Chief Judge John Roll of the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] and five other people were killed in the shooting, plus another 14 wounded, including Giffords. Before serving in the Arizona District Court, Roll was a state judge and an assistant US attorney. Roll was named to the District Court in 1991 by President George HW Bush and became chief judge in 2006. Giffords received harsh criticism in Arizona for her vote for the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Health+Care">news archive</a>] and was among those members of Congress who reported threats or vandalism in 2010. Giffords also was an outspoken critic of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Ultimately, however, a clear motive into the shootings has yet to be identified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"The constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution," the press release said. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group is a five-member panel consisting of the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader, Majority Whip, Minority Leader and Minority Whip. Under House rules, the advisory group has the authority to instruct the non-partisan office of the House General Counsel to take legal action on behalf of the House of Representatives, the press release said.

<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">announced last month</a> [JURIST report] that it will <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [press release] of Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] acknowledged that the announcement marks a change in policy for the DOJ and the Obama administration, but noted that the change was necessary due to cases pending in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Holder explained that when the DOJ previously defended DOMA it had done so in jurisdictions with binding precedent stating that a permissive standard of review was applicable to laws dealing with sexual orientation.<br />

House Bill 1649 amends current law that recognizes out-of-state domestic partnerships and civil unions, but excludes <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. The vote took place on Friday evening, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014405211_apwaxgrdomesticpartnerships1stldwritethru.html">leaving several representatives displeased</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] that the debate would not be readily available to voters. The bill will proceed to the Senate for voting.

<p>In January, the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/lsoweb/session/sessionhome.aspx">Wyoming House of Representatives</a> approved a <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2011/Bills/HB0074.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would prevent Wyoming from recognizing same-sex marriages and civil unions performed out-of-state. However, several states recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. Earlier this month, New Mexico <a href="http://www.nmag.gov/">Attorney General Gary King</a> [official website] issued an opinion stating that gay marriages from out of state would <a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/68490/king-says-new-mexico-can-recognize-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages">likely be legal</a> [<em>The New Mexico Independent</em> report] there. In February, Maryland <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/">Attorney General Douglas Gansler</a> [official website] declared that <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/maryland-should-recognize-out-of-state.php">Maryland should recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere</a> [JURIST report].

The <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillamd/hb0497s01.pdf">Utah Illegal Immigration Enforcement Act</a> [HB 497 text, PDF] replaces the <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillamd/hb0070.pdf">older version</a> [HB 70 text, PDF] of the law that had lost favor with state Senate members in the last few weeks. The new law <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillamd/hb0497s01.amdx.pdf">omits</a> [text, PDF] the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51370262-76/utah-arizona-bill-enforcement.html.csp">controversial language</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] that critics had accused of being too similar to the controversial Arizona-style law. The Utah law still requires police officers to question any individual about their immigration status if stopped for a felony or serious misdemeanor, but now omits the "reasonable suspicion" standard for police officials. The new law also clarifies that any inquiry into the legal status of a person stopped for a lesser misdemeanor is optional. The new law also eliminates a provision that would have made it mandatory for anyone in Utah to carry identification with them at all times. Critics of the law, however, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51360287-76/bill-sandstrom-enforcement-immigration.html.csp?page=1">remain skeptical</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] as to whether the changes are significant enough to differentiate Utah's immigration policies from those of Arizona. 

<p>The older version of the bill, sponsored by <a href="http://www.utah.gov/house/detail.html?i=SANDSSE">Representative Stephen Sandstrom</a> (R) [official profile], was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/utah-house-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved by the House</a> [JURIST report] last month, but the bill soon lost favor in the Senate, causing Sandstrom to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51360287-76/bill-sandstrom-enforcement-immigration.html.csp?page=1">abandon the bill</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] and draft a new version. Several states have <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST reports] similar to the controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">Arizona immigration law</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Arizona law, which has been widely criticized as unconstitutional for allegedly legalizing racial profiling, has sparked a nationwide debate on immigration policy, prompting <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">calls for immigration reform</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile]. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court in the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/azd/CourtInfo.nsf/A85E29E4AC9B19EA072577B6007835F8/$file/10-1061-447.pdf?openelement">denied</a> [order, PDF] motions to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the Arizona law. <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration.php">Two other lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging the law were filed last year and are still pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorneys for James Barton, previously convicted on drug and weapons charges, argued that his 2007 arrest on two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000922----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 922(g)(1)</a> [text] constitutes a violation of Barton's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Second Amendment</a> [text] rights. The court's ruling acknowledges an individual's right to bear arms as "fundamental," but also recognizes the validity of "longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms," including prior felony convictions. Responding to Barton's citation to the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>], in which the right to possess a handgun in one's home for the purpose of self-defense was upheld, the court noted that the decision was conditioned on a finding that the party is "not 'disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights.'" Per the court, the nature of Barton's earlier offenses and their correlation with violent crime rendered the argument inapplicable.

<p>In June, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in a 5-4 decision that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment applicable to states as well as the federal government. In the case of <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1521">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], the Supreme Court struck down the city's ordinance that effectively banned the possession of handguns in the city. The ruling was premised in part on the <u>Heller</u> decision, in that that the Second Amendment right to own firearms for lawful purposes is not unlimited.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The trial was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703386704576186410708715574.html">suspended</a> [WSJ report] in light of claims made by co-defendant Remy Chardon, Chirac's former chief of staff, that a decision by the prosecution to dismiss the statute of limitations in the case against Chardon violates the French Constitution. The trial is a combination of two separate corruption-related cases, which accuse Chirac and nine others, including Chardon, of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12661446">misusing public funds</a> [BBC report] during Chirac's time as mayor of Paris. Chirac allegedly financed the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed as the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], by illegally establishing fake city positions between 1977 and 1995 for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars. The first day of trial was reserved for procedural matters, and Chirac did not attend. The court is expected to make a decision regarding the constitutional claim on Tuesday. Under French law, Chirac is not obligated to appear in court during any of the proceedings, but it is anticipated that he will be at the proceedings on Tuesday if the trial goes forward. The trial will be "adjourned indefinitely" if the constitutional claim is referred to a higher court.

<p>The trial began despite the fact that the main plaintiff dropped out of the suit. Last September, the Paris city council <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">accepted a settlement deal</a> [JURIST report] in which the former president agreed to pay USD $741,000 in compensation for the money paid out for false jobs. In exchange, the city agreed to drop out of a corruption suit. Chirac stated that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. A French judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">placed Chirac under preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. Chirac's trial on corruption charges <a href="/hotline/2009/12/jacques-chiracs-trial-on-corruption.php">marks the first time</a> [JURIST comment] a former president will have to answer to charges against him in a court of law.</p>

<p>3/8/11 - The court has postponed Chirac's trial until at least June to consider the constitutional challenge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Texas death row inmate Henry Skinner filed a &#167; 1983 claim seeking access to DNA evidence that he believes will prove his innocence. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/10/10-70002.1.wpd.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court decision to dismiss Skinner's claim, stating that relief could only be sought through <em>habeas corpus</em>. Reversing the Fifth Circuit, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority:<blockquote>[W]e hold that a postconviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a &#167; 1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove exculpatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a judgment that simply orders DNA tests "necessarily impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State's custody."</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito.

<p>Skinner was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995 for the murders of his live-in girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. He claims that, while he was in the house at the time the murders occurred, he was incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine. He has identified Busby's uncle as the possible murderer and believes that DNA evidence will exonerate him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Department of the Navy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-freedom-of-information-act.php">report</a>] that the government may not withhold certain information under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. The issue was whether 5 USC &#167; 552(b)(2) (Exemption 2), which allows a government agency to keep secret only documents related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency, must be strictly construed to preclude the "High 2" expansion created by some circuits but rejected by others. Petitioner Glen Scott Milner filed two FOIA requests for information about a US Navy magazine near his home, but the Navy withheld certain documents under Exemption 2. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/08/05/07-36056.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the Navy, ruling that Exemption 2 encompasses two exemptions&#8212;the "Low 2" exemption, which covers ordinary employment matters, and the "High 2" exemption, which covers materials whose "disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation." Reversing the Ninth Circuit, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the majority:<blockquote>Exemption 2, consistent with the plain meaning of theterm "personnel rules and practices," encompasses onlyrecords relating to issues of employee relations and human resources. The explosives maps and data requested heredo not qualify for withholding under that exemption. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissent. 

<p>Milner lives near Indian Island, a small island in the state of Washington that houses a naval magazine in which the Navy maintains non-nuclear explosives. In 2003 and 2004, Milner submitted two FOIA requests to the navy, seeking, among other things, explosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) information for the naval magazine. The Navy disclosed most of the documents that Milner requested but withheld the ESQD information on the grounds that it could threaten the naval magazine and surrounding community's safety and security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.democraticpartyofgeorgia.org/splash">Democratic Party of Georgia</a> [party website] brought the suit against Governor Sonny Perdue, Secretary of State Karen Handel and the State Election board seeking permanent injunctive relief against enforcement of the <a href="http://www.sos.ga.gov/electionconnection/pdf/21-2-417.pdf">2006 Photo ID Act</a> (OCGA &#167; 21-2-417 text, PDF), contending that the ID requirement imposes a condition on the right of registered Georgia voters to vote, in violation of numerous sections of the state's constitution. The Democratic Party further argued that the act creates an undue burden on the right to vote and thus violates the equal protection clause of the Georgia Constitution. The court, voting 6-1, held:<blockquote>The 2006 Act does not deprive any Georgia voter from casting a ballot in any election. A registered voter who does not possess a photo ID and who desires to vote in person can obtain a free photo ID at one or more locations in the county of his or her residence. This Court has held that requiring an additional step in the voting process in order to validate identity is not unconstitutional. Alternatively, if a registered voter appears at the polls without a photo ID, that individual may still cast a provisional ballot and have the vote counted upon presentation of an acceptable photo ID within 48 hours. Finally, an elector who does not wish to obtain a free photo ID can vote by absentee ballot by mail.</blockquote>The 2006 Photo ID Act has been challenged, relatively unsuccessfully, since its inception. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eleventh-circuit-upholds-georgia-voter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the law after two elderly voters in Georgia filed suit, alleging that the ID regulation made it difficult for them to participate in elections. This decision, along with the most recent one, rely to a large extent on the April 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-21P.ZO">Crawford v. Marion County Election Board</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-allows-indiana-voter.php">report</a>], which held that Indiana's controversial voter identification statute did not put an undue burden on the right to vote and therefore did not violate the US Constitution.

<p>In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October. The court held that the law, <a href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2004/dec04/prop200.pdf">Proposition 200</a> [text, PDF], was inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/voting/nvra/activ_nvra.php">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [materials], which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states. The NVRA requires voters to attest to the validity of the information on their registration form, including their citizenship, but does not require them to provide additional proof of citizenship. Proposition 200 went beyond the federal statute, requiring applicants to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The six activists not released today will <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/07/zimbabwe.unrest/">remain detained and face trial</a> [CNN report] on the treason charges against them. If found guilty, they could be executed, pursuant to Zimbabwean law. The charges and subsequent arrests stem from the activists' attendance at a lecture on February 19, where footage of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/over-1000-detained-in-egypt-amid-widespread-protests.php">widespread protests in Egypt</a> [JURIST report], which resulted in the ouster of Egyptian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile], was shown. Defense lawyers maintain they were participating in an academic debate on African politics while prosecutors contend they were engaged in a discussion regarding the possibility of an ouster of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>]. In making its decision, the court considered the activities each engaged in and held that the majority of them could be released as they had merely listened to allegedly treasonous utterances in contrast to the other six, who had organized and spoken at the meeting.

<p>The protests in Egypt have led to a variety of reactions from countries across the globe. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-inspired-protestors-face-violent-crackdowns-by-arab-governments-hrw.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Arab governments are using violence to crack down on protests inspired by the unrest in Egypt. According to the report, public gatherings in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, West Bank and Yemen have encountered force from security officials. In Ramallah, Palestine peaceful demonstrators were punched and kicked by the "special forces." Two journalists, a HRW research assistant and organizers of the demonstrations in Ramallah were detained. In Syria, police forces stood by as 20 people in civilian clothing beat demonstrators that had assembled to hold a candlelight vigil for Egyptian demonstrators. On February 4, police detained Ghassan al-Najjar, the leader of the Islamic Democratic Current, after he issued calls for Syrians to demonstrate for more freedom in their country. In Saudi Arabia, citizens canceled their plans for a peaceful sit-in to urge reform and better jobs after they were summoned by Interior Ministry officials. Sudanese authorities have also targeted journalists and censored newspapers covering protests. On February 2, more than a dozen of the staff of al-Maidan, a communist newspaper, were arrested. HRW also reported of an unconfirmed death of a student, Mohammed Abderahman, who was part of a protest in late January which was suppressed by excessive force. In Yemen, 6 people were injured and 28 arrested, including journalists and human rights activists, according to the <a href="http://www.yohr.org/">Yemeni Observatory of Human Rights</a> [official website; in Arabic]. In Bahrain, the government shut down a Facebook page calling for protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case centered around Aruna Shanbaug, a former nurse who was raped and strangled at work 37 years ago and has been in Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital in a blind and vegetative state ever since. Pinki Virani, a journalist and friend, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Aruna-Shanbaug-has-to-live-SC/Article1-670414.aspx">petitioned the court</a> [<em>Hindustan Times</em> report] to stop hospital staff from force feeding Shanbaug and allow her to die. The court stated that, while there is no statutory provision to support active euthanasia, where an individual dies by lethal injection, passive euthanasia through a withdrawal of life support would be permissible with approval by the high court after receiving requests from the government and close family members of the individual and getting the opinions of three respected doctors. The court determined that Virani was not as close to Shanbaug as hospital staff and rejected her petition.

<p>Last year, the German <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/cln_136/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php"> emoving a patient from life support is not a criminal offense</a> [JURIST report] if the terminal individual had previously given consent. The landmark ruling legalized the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] in Germany and overturned the nine-month sentence of a lawyer who was convicted for advising a client to remove her mother from life support after being in a coma since 2002. In 2009, Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4758935.stm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refused to sign an Italian government decree</a> [JURIST report] that would stop the euthanasia of a comatose woman. <a href="http://www.zadig.it/speciali/ee/">Eluana Englaro</a> [materials, in Italian] had been in a vegetative state for 16 years, and her father had petitioned to remove her feeding tube. Napolitano refused to sign the decree because it would effectively overrule a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-high-court-approves-feeding-tube.php">2008 decision</a> [JURIST report] by the country's <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Notizie/Notizie.asp">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] to allow for removal of the tube, thus violating the separation of power between the executive and judicial branches.  In 2006, a proposed bill that would legalize the option of assisted suicide in the UK was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside by the House of Lords</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition from the public and two physician groups</a> [JURIST reports].

The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had reversed the district court's judgment that a petition for leniency is different from an appeal to correct legal errors and therefore does not result in a tolling of the statute of limitations under AEDPA. Agreeing with the First Circuit, Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court:<blockquote>We hold that the phrase "collateral review" in &#167; 2244(d)(2) means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review. Because the parties agree that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the direct review process, we hold that respondent's motion tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal habeas petition was therefore timely.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a separate opinion concurring in part. 

<p>The First Circuit's decision was in line with a Tenth Circuit ruling on the same issue, but the Third, Fourth and Eleventh Circuits had previously ruled that a petition for leniency does not toll the statute of limitations under AEDPA. The Supreme Court's ruling resolves the circuit split.</p>]]></content:encoded>

New charges in the military commission system have been suspended since shortly after Obama took office in 2009. Monday's order also establishes a procedure for establishing a review process for detainees who have not been charged, convicted or designated for transfer. In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/new-actions-guantanamo-bay-and-detainee-policy">statement</a> [text], Obama said:<blockquote>From the beginning of my Administration, the United States has worked to bring terrorists to justice consistent with our commitment to protect the American people and uphold our values. Today, I am announcing several steps that broaden our ability to bring terrorists to justice, provide oversight for our actions, and ensure the humane treatment of detainees. I strongly believe that the American system of justice is a key part of our arsenal in the war against al Qaeda and its affiliates, and we will continue to draw on all aspects of our justice system&#8212;including Article III Courts&#8212;to ensure that our security and our values are strengthened. Going forward, all branches of government have a responsibility to come together to forge a strong and durable approach to defend our nation and the values that define who we are as a nation.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/president-obama-issues-executive-order-institutionalizing-indefinite-detention">condemned the order</a> [press release], calling it, "window dressing for the reality that today&#8217;s executive order institutionalizes indefinite detention, which is unlawful, unwise and un-American."

<p>Last April, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d2010manual.pdf">manual</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pentagon-releases-manual-for-military.php">report</a>] for military commission procedures under the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF]. The manual established the rules of evidence and procedure for the commissions, allowing for the admission of certain hearsay evidence and defining "material support" for terrorism. The release came a month after <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-appoints-top.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] retired Navy <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] as the convening authority for military commissions. The position oversees military commissions themselves as well as the Office of Military Commissions and, notably, has the power to review and approve charges against "belligerents" pursuant to the Military Commissions Act. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] urged the administration to abandon military commissions, calling the system <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">"fatally flawed"</a> [JURIST report] and beyond hope of reform. Scheinin's comments followed shortly after reports emerged indicating that the administration was considering <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">trying specific suspects in military courts</a> [JURIST report] rather than through the civilian justice system. In May 2009, unidentified sources revealed that the administration would pursue a broad <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/obama-may-continue-military-commission.php">reinstitution of the commission system</a> [JURIST report] due to concerns about the viability of trying terror suspects in federal courts and, in particular, of meeting federal evidentiary standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's statement came in conjunction with International Women's Day. The High Commissioner expressed concern that constitutional reforms in Egypt were being "undertaken without [women's] full participation" and that some proposed reforms were discriminatory.  Pillay urged action:<blockquote>In Egypt and Tunisia, women were on Twitter, on Facebook, and on the streets. Women from all walks of life were marching alongside men, pushing boundaries and breaking gender stereotypes, just as eager for change, for human rights and for democracy. ... In these moments of historic transition in Egypt and Tunisia, it is important to ensure that women's rights are not set aside as something to be dealt with after the "crucial" reforms are won. Women's rights should be at the top of the list of new priorities. ... Women ... expect their state ... to uphold their dignity and worth, and to adopt laws, policies, and strategies that translate these words into tangible results. ... Only when women participate fully in policy-making and institution-building will their perspective be truly integrated. The concept of democracy is only truly realised when political decision-making is shared by women and men, and women's full participation in institutional re-building is guaranteed. Societies in which women are excluded, formally or informally, from public life, cannot be described as truly democratic.</blockquote>Pillay addressed the persistent inequality between men and women around the world and urged vigilance against retrogression, and full participation in reform. Egypt's military council has been running the country since Egyptian <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">president Hosni Mubarak was forced out</a> [JURIST report] and has indicated a referendum will be held March 19 on <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7260J820110307?sp=true">constitutional reforms</a> [Reuters report] proposed by a committee of legal experts.  

<p>Pillay has vociferously decried the use of violence against protesters in recent months as protests have spread across the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC Backgrounder]. Last week, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-urges-international-protection-for-middle-east-protesters.php">condemned the response by Middle Eastern governments</a> [JURIST report] to peaceful protests during her opening remarks at the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website], urging the international community to take a strong stance against violence in Libya. In February, Pillay called on the Libyan government and Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile] directly to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-action-to-halt-libya-violence.php">stop the violence directed at protesters</a> [JURIST report] within that nation. Also in February, Pillay said that the Libyan government's response to recent protests <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">may amount to crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling is a significant setback for EU governments that have been negotiating for a unified EU patent system for over 30 years. The drive to unify the patent process is fueled in part by the complex process of securing a patent for each individual country in the EU, which requires numerous applications and costly translations. In addition, if litigation arises, litigants must take the dispute to every country where an infraction in occurring making <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/market_news/article.jsp?content=D9LR1C180">enforcement an onerous task</a> [AP report].  Efforts to establish a unified patent system have been opposed by Italy and Spain in part because the current plan allows for <a href="http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2011/march/european-patent-court-would-infringe-eu-law-court-rules/70469.aspx">patents to be filed only in English, German or French</a> [European Voice report]. The ECJ summed up its major objection to the proposed ECPC:<blockquote>[T]he envisaged agreement, by conferring on an international court which is outside the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union an exclusive jurisdiction to hear a significant number of actions brought by individuals in the field of the Community patent and to interpret and apply European Union law in that field, would deprive courts of Member States of their powers in relation to the interpretation and application of European Union law and the Court of its powers to reply, by preliminary ruling, to questions referred by those courts and, consequently, would alter the essential character of the powers which the Treaties confer on the institutions of the European Union and on the Member States and which are indispensable to the preservation of the very nature of European Union law.</blockquote>EU officials have been quick to note that the ruling is not fatal to a unitary patent regime, but rather to the ECPC which would have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/03/08/business-eu-europe-patent-litigation_8343971.html">adjudicated disputes arising in connection with patents</a> [AP report] in 38 countries including some countries not part of the EU. 

<p>In February, the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/eu-lawmakers-consent-to-common-patent-system.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to the establishment of a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110215IPR13680/html/EU-patent-Parliament-gives-go-ahead-for-enhanced-cooperation">common patent system</a> [press release] despite lack of accord from Spain and Italy. The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Lisbon Treaty</a> [text] generally requires a unanimous vote from EU member states, but the "<a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/enhanced_cooperation_en.htm">enhanced co-operation</a>" [EU backgrounder] provision allows groups of member states to adopt new common rules when unanimity is difficult to achieve. Lawmakers argue that a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/eu-lawmakers-back-compromise-plans-to-establish-patent-system.html">uniform patent system is necessary</a> [Bloomberg report] to keep European nations competitive with global rivals like China by lowering patent costs for small businesses in particular. The EU has applied the "enhanced co-operation" provision in only one other resolution. In January 2010, the EU employed the provision to enable some EU countries to work together to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/eu-considering-enhanced-cooperation-to.php">create uniform marriage laws</a> [JURIST report] for mixed-nationality couples on the grounds that cross-border divorces are often problematic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under a 1991 settlement agreement, Exxon paid $900 million in civil damages. The US and Alaskan government <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/doj-alaska-want-92-million-more-for.php">sought in 2006 to reopen the settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report], saying more money was needed to clean up the crude oil that was still tainting Prince William Sound. Environmental activist Rick Steiner had filed a motion seeking court intervention to bring the reopener process to a close. Judge H Russel Holland, who has presided over much of the litigation stemming from 1989 spill, found that the US and Alaskan governments appeared to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/exxon-valdez-idUSN0713681920110308">close to reaching an agreement</a> [Reuters report] with Exxon Mobil, refusing to order the payment.

<p>In 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that Exxon Mobil <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ninth-circuit-rules-exxon-mobil-owes.php">owes interest</a> [JURIST report] on the more than $500 million in punitive damages awarded against it following the spill. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/us-supreme-court-declines-to-consider.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] on the issue the previous year, thus remanding it to the Ninth Circuit. In June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">reduce a punitive damages award</a> [JURIST report] to be paid by Exxon from $2.5 billion to $500 million, but did not rule on the issue of interest. In December 2006, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/appeals-court-chops-2-billion-off.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] Exxon's original $5 billion punitive damage award by more than $2 billion, ruling that the award was excessive in light of a 2003 Supreme Court ruling that punitive damages must be reasonable and proportionate to the harm incurred, and also considering Exxon's cleanup and compensation efforts. The Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound and contaminated about 1,300 miles of coastline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Costa Rica <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/costa-rica-files-icj-complaint-over-nicaragua-border-dispute.php">filed a complaint with the ICJ</a> [JURIST report] in November accusing Nicaragua of violating its territorial integrity and damaging protected wetlands. Tuesday's order is a preliminary measure while the case is pending before the court. The ICJ unanimously ordered all civilian, police and military personnel out of the area and voted 13-4 to allow Costa Rica to send environmental personnel to the area:<blockquote>Each Party shall refrain from sending to, or maintaining in the disputed territory, including the <em>cano</em>, any personnel, whether civilian, police or security. ... Costa Rica may dispatch civilian personnel charged with the protection of the environment to the disputed territory, including the <em>cano</em>, but only in so far as it is necessary to avoid irreparable prejudice being caused to the part of the wetland where that territory is situated; Costa Rica shall consult with the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention in regard to these actions, give Nicaragua prior notice of them and use its best endeavours to find common solutions with Nicaragua in this respect.</blockquote>Officials from <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jFDDiLdy-3aetI8HRQp1PHRDUmWg?docId=6176895">both countries praised the ruling</a> [CP report].

<p>The case centers around Calero Island, a small area of land at the mouth of the San Jose river that has been disputed territory for over a century. The dispute arose last month when Eden Pastora, director of the dredging project, relied on a <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/11/costa-rican-nicaraguan-country-border.html">Google Maps error</a> [Google Maps statement] based on flawed US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] information to send troops to the area. In 2009, the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icj-rules-costa-rica-has-right-to.php">adjudicated another dispute</a> [JURIST report] between Costa Rica and Nicaragua surrounding use of the San Jose river, which separates the two Central American nations. The court <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/133/15321.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] in July 2009 that Nicaragua had interfered with Costa Rica's right of free navigation on the San Juan river four years after Costa Rica filed the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;code=coni&amp;case=133&amp;k=37">complaint</a> [case materials] in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All six are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of violence. The suspects were summoned to appear before the ICC on April 7 for an initial appearance. This would be followed by a confirmation of charges hearing, after which the court would then need to decide whether the suspects should stand trial.

<p>Earlier in December, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-kenya-threats-will-not-stop-election-violence-prosecutions.php">rejected the notion</a> [JURIST report] that threats of violence would delay the prosecution.

The injunction <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/us-chevron-ecuador-idUSTRE72707220110308">blocks</a> [Reuters report] plaintiffs from attempting to secure $8.6 billion in damages from the company, which were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] last month by the Provincial Court of Sucumbios after finding that Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of Ecuador's rain forest. As Chevron does not hold assets in Ecuador, the ruling eliminates the possibility that the plaintiffs will seek enforcement in other countries where the company operates and reserves the final decision on enforcement for the US judicial system. The ruling effectively extends a <a href="http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/SDNYRestrainingOrder.pdf">temporary restraining order</a> [text, PDF] issued last month.

<p>Following last month's verdict, Chevron <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/02142011_illegitimatejudgmentagainstchevroninecuadorlawsuit.news">vowed to appeal</a> [press release] and called the ruling "illegitimate and unenforceable" and "the product of fraud," while the plaintiffs' lawyer also announced his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/world/americas/15ecuador.html?_r=2&src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB">intention to appeal</a> [NYT report] after the court awarded far less than the $113 billion originally sought. Also in February, Chevron <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/02012011_chevronfilesfraudandricocaseagainstlawyersandconsultantsbehindecuadorlitigation.news">filed a lawsuit</a> [press release] against plaintiffs' lawyers and consultants in the case, claiming that professionals for the plaintiffs were attempting to extort Chevron. In July, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/entertainment/la-et-crude-20100716">upheld</a> [LAT report] a May <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/judge-rules-that-filmmaker-must-give-footage-to-chevron/">ruling</a> [NYT report] by the Southern District of New York ordering filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over to Chevron certain outtakes from his 2009 documentary <a href="http://www.crudethemovie.com/">Crude</a> [film website]. Chevron claims the outtakes show plaintiffs' lawyers discussing illegal and unethical tactics, including ghost-writing a court appointed expert's report, intimidating a judge and colluding with government officials. The suit was <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LCT1G00.htm">re-filed in Ecuador</a> [AP report] in 2003 after being dismissed by the Southern District of New York in 1996. Chevron claims that a 1995 cleanup agreement between Ecuador and Texaco, completed in 1998 at a cost of $40 million, absolves Chevron of all liability. Plaintiffs originally filed suit against Texaco, which operated the oil fields from the 1960's until the early 1990's.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015E.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [HB 15 text; <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=HB15">materials</a>] requires doctors to conduct a vaginal ultrasound and display the images at least 24 hours prior to an abortion, and would strip them of their medical licenses should they fail to do so. It is now expected to <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7461306.html">proceed to a conference committee</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report] to reconcile with the <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/SB00016E.pdf#navpanes=0">version</a> [SB 16 text; <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB16">materials</a>], <a href="http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/82r/pdf/82RSJ02-17-F1.PDF#page=2">passed</a> [roll call vote] last month. Key differences in the Senate bill include a waiting period of only two hours and exceptions from the requirements under certain circumstances, including rape, incest or fetal abnormalities. Once through committee, the legislation will go to <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] for his signature.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/house/">Kansas House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved</a> several new abortion restrictions, including one similar to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">recent Nebraska act</a> [JURIST reports] that prohibits the procedure after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. In December, the Alaska Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/alaska-judge-upholds-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">upheld a parental consent notification law</a>, whereas in November, Colorado voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">rejected an amendment</a> [JURIST reports] that would have granted fetuses a "personhood" status, effectively banning abortion. In June, then-Florida governor Charlie Crist <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] in May requiring women seeking an abortion to complete an extensive questionnaire a month after <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">passing laws</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting abortions performed because of a fetus' gender, protecting medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs, and regulating the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Friday, Judge Roger Vinson <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/announcements/documents/310cv91doc167.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-stays-earlier-injunction-against-health-care-reform-act.php">report</a>] the Obama administration's petition to stay his <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">previous order</a> [JURIST report] on the condition that an appeal would be filed within a week. The stay has allowed the administration to continue its implementation of the law in other states until after appellate review. The administration had not formally sought a stay on the injunction, but rather had requested Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">"clarify"</a> [JURIST report] his earlier judgment in order to determine its "potential impact" on the implementation of the Act. In January, Vinson voided the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), saying that requiring all Americans over the age of 18 to have health insurance violated the Constitution by exceeding Congress' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] power. The case will now be reviewed by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website].  

<p>The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges across the country. Last month, <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] for a <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/24454%20pdf%20McCullough.pdf">writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] rules on the issue. In January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The closing arguments, which were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/closing-arguments-begin-in-trial-of-former-liberian-president-taylor-enters.php">originally set to begin last month</a>, had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pending-appeal-delays-closing-trial-of-former-liberian-president.php">postponed</a> pending an appeals chamber decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-to-hear-defense-closing-arguments.php">accept the defense's final written brief</a> [JURIST reports] after the trial chamber disregarded the brief because it was 20 days late.

Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. In the motion to dismiss the new trial, Blagojevich's lawyers argued that economic reasons make a second trial "imprudent":<blockquote>To date, defense counsel have been working on the Blagojevich case for almost nine months without pay. This has caused a significant hardship and has deprived Blagojevich of his right to effective assistance of counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. ... Based upon the economic hardships, the inequities and the unnecessary drain on taxpayer funds (funds may not even exist in the future), this case should be dismissed. The Court can proceed immediately to sentencing on the conviction from the first trial.</blockquote>Blagojevich has always maintained his innocence, and the false statements charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

<p>Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] granted federal prosecutors' motion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dismiss three charges</a> [JURIST report] against Blagojevich in an apparent effort to simply their case before the April 20 retrial. In Blagojevich's first trial, the jury deliberated for 14 days after the 11-week trial but was unable to reach a consensus on all but one of the charges. In September, lawyers for Blagojevich asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-override-false-statements-conviction.php">throw out the sole conviction</a>, stating that the government failed to meet its required burden of proof, but the judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-refuses-to-throw-out-blagojevich-conviction.php">refused</a> [JURIST reports]. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate voted unanimously to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">remove him from office</a> [JURIST report]. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two months after the <a href = "http://www.ilga.gov/senate/">Illinois Senate</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/illinois-senate-votes-to-abolish-death-penalty.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report], Quinn <a href = "http://www.state.il.us/cms/download/mp3_iisradio/GOV-3-9.mp3">signed the bill</a> [audio] into law. Justifying his decision in a <A href = "http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=9265">statement</a> [press release], Quinn said:<blockquote>Since our experience has shown that there is no way to design a perfect death penalty system, free from the numerous flaws that can lead to wrongful convictions or discriminatory treatment, I have concluded that the proper course of action is to abolish it. With our broken system, we cannot ensure justice is achieved in every case. For the same reason, I have also decided to commute the sentences of those currently on death row to natural life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole or release. I have found no credible evidence that the death penalty has a deterrent effect on the crime of murder and that the enormous sums expended by the state in maintaining a death penalty system would be better spent on preventing crime and assisting victims' families in overcoming their pain and grief.</blockquote>Illinois legislators have attempted to ban the death penalty since then-governor George Ryan put a moratorium on it 11 years ago. Although the new law will <a href = "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-quinn-expected-to-sign-death-penalty-ban-wednesday-20110308,0,760881.story">officially take effect</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] on July 1, Quinn commuted the current 15 death row inmates' sentences to life without parole.

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue worldwide. According to an <a href =  "http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">report</a>], the number of countries using the death penalty dropped in 2009, but more than 700 people were executed in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the US. Last August, <a href = "http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] heard a <em>habeas</em> petition from Troy Davis, who was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia police officer. In a rare move, the federal court heard the <em>habeas</em> petition after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href = "http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text], but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence. <a href = "http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [official website] Executive Director Sarah Totonchi <a href = "/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">argues</a> [JURIST commentary] said that "Troy Davis' case illustrates that US courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICC on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">issued summons</a> [JURIST report] for six Kenyans accused of inciting the violence, including current Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and several Ministry heads. All six are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of violence. A government spokesperson stated the ICC summons are an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-10/kenyan-government-says-icc-summonses-send-signal-country-a-failed-state.html">attempt to signal that Kenya is a failed state</a> [Bloomberg report]. He also noted that the government's challenge of the ICC's jurisdiction is a way to show the country's progress. The suspects have been summoned to appear before the ICC on April 7 for an initial appearance. This would be followed by a confirmation of charges hearing, after which the court would then need to decide whether the suspects should stand trial. 

<p>Members of the Kenyan government have previously rejected the ICC's authority to try cases relating to the post-election violence. In December, the <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/">Kenyan Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kenya-lawmakers-approve-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] the country from the ICC. The motion was approved after ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-accuses-6-kenyans-of-orchestrating-2007-post-election-violence.php">identified the six suspects</a> targeted by the ICC and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-kenya-threats-will-not-stop-election-violence-prosecutions.php">rejected the notion</a> [JURIST reports] that threats of violence would delay the prosecution. In November, the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, which implicated former Cabinet minster William Ruto of interfering with the ICC investigation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-rights-group-accuses-official-of-interfering-with-icc-election-investigation.php">denied accusations that it had bribed witnesses</a> [JURIST report]. Moreno-Campo had also said that the court will <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-prosecutor-says-court-will-not-use-testimony-of-allegedly-bribed-kenya-witnesses.php">not use testimony</a> [JURIST report] from three Kenyan witnesses who claim they were bribed to provide false evidence against a high-ranking government official. In September, Kenyan businessman Joseph Gathungu filed a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-businessman-challenges-legality-of-icc-investigation.php">challenging the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of the ICC investigation into the post-election violence. Violence following the election left more than 1,100 people dead, 3,500 injured and up to 600,000 forcibly displaced. In addition, there were hundreds of rapes and more than 100,000 different properties were destroyed in Kenya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," similar to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">bill passed in Nebraska</a> [JURIST report] last year, is based on evidence suggesting that a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/10/us-oklahoma-abortion-idUSTRE7290C420110310">fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report]. The legislation would permit abortions after the 20-week mark only in cases where the mother's life is at risk or she faces serious injury. Doctors who perform abortions after 20 weeks would be subject to criminal prosecution, but there would be no penalty for women undergoing the procedure. The bill will now advance to the Senate, where it is <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-house-approves-restrictive-abortion-measure/article/3547369">expected to pass</a> [NewsOK report].

<p>This bill is the latest attempt by the Oklahoma legislature to place restrictions on abortion. In July, an Oklahoma district judge extended a temporary restraining order <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">blocking enforcement of a new law</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking abortions  to have an ultrasound and hear a description of the fetus. In May, Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-legislature-overrides-veto-of-pre-abortion-questionaire-bill.php">overrode a veto</a> [JURIST report] by Oklahoma <a href="http://www.gov.ok.gov/index.php">Governor Brad Henry</a> [official website] and approved a bill requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. In April, Henry <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">signed three abortion bills into law</a> [JURIST report]. The first bill prohibits abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus. The second bill creates the Freedom of Conscience Act and protects medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs. The third bill regulates the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the plan, the prime minister would be chosen based on the political party elected to a majority of seats in parliament, more power would be granted to the parliament and local officials would also be granted more power through a "regionalization program." Under the regionalization program, officials would be elected to regional councils through a direct vote, and the councils would be responsible for governing the affairs of the region. The monarch stressed the importance of regional equality, stating:<blockquote>Our ultimate objective is to strengthen the foundations for a Moroccan regionalization system throughout the Kingdom, particularly in the Moroccan Sahara provinces. It should be based on good governance which guarantees a new, more equitable system for sharing not only powers, but also resources between the central authority and the regions. What I do not want is a two-speed regionalization, with fortunate regions that have the resources required for their progress on the one hand, and underprivileged regions lacking the requisites for development, on the other.</blockquote>The plan would also promote the participation of women in the political process, and it was noted that "the law should favour equal access by women and men to elected office." In order to begin the reform process, Mohammed announced the formation of a committee, which will meet with the various factions within the country and formulate specific language for the constitutional reforms based on the guidelines set forth by the monarch. According to the king, the committee is to make their recommendations by June, and the constitutional reforms will then be put to a vote in a national referendum. 

<p>The announcement of the constitutional reforms comes less than a month after <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0nK8l_SJCtJBKcT7YkOImpIhsPw?docId=CNG.9bfa3f79ce20b70cbc21d53796182754.101">thousands of Moroccans demonstrated</a> [AFP report] across the country, demanding limits on the power of the monarch, as well as more sweeping political reform. Similar protests have occurred recently throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], and have resulted in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports].

Three officers were <a href="http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Court-jails-DRC-army-officers-for-rape-20110310">sentenced to 15 years in prison</a> [AFP report], while eight others were sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life. UN envoy on sexual violence, Margot Wallstrom, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37728&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=">welcomed the verdict</a> [UN News Centre report] as sign that justice is possible. "This sends a strong signal to all perpetrators of acts of sexual violence that no military commander is beyond the law, including members of a national army," she said. "It also shows that the focus on ending impunity for this type of crimes continues to render concrete results."

<p>Last month, the same court found Lt Col Kibibi Mutware <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">guilty of involvement in mass rapes</a> [JURIST report] that took place on New Year's Day and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment, dismissing him from the military. Eight of his troops were also given prison sentences of between 10 and 20 years and expelled from the army for their involvement in the attack. The DRC has been called the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650112.stm">rape capital of the world</a> [BBC report] by senior UN officials. Members of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc10016.doc.htm">expressed "outrage"</a> [statement] last August over a different mass rape in the DRC, calling for <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-security-council-urges-justice-for-drc-rape-victims.php">justice for the victims</a> [JURIST report].

In a <a href = "http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/shownews.php?lng=en&_nsid=9171">speech</a> [press release] given to supporters in Sana'a, Saleh promised various reforms:<blockquote>The initiative includes transferring government power to an elected parliamentary system by the end 2011, shifting the local authority to full-power local ruling, establish Yemeni regions on the grounds of economic and geographical criteria and prepare a new election law includes proportional representation in addition to forming a new government of national unity.</blockquote> Saleh also ordered officials "to listen to demands of the youth who are holding sit-ins." Saleh has previously pledged <a href = "http://www.yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=3208&MainCat=6">not to run for reelection</a> [<em>Yemen Post</em> report] and will retire in 2013. He promised not to allow his son to succeed him, ordered a 15 percent salary increase for government employees and canceled student tuition fees at public universities. Protests have continued despite his announcement, culminating on Tuesday near Sana'a University, when security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets on anti-government protesters. Conflicting reports state <a href = "http://www.yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=3260&MainCat=3">as many as 80 were injured</a> [<em>Yemen Post</em> report], and <A href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbtDXJ_OBD258DfVI9e2UfsciCXw?docId=72cac5113b3c4d979c64bb18ca6817c3">as many as two killed</a> [AP report].

<p>Protests, largely organized by the Joint Meeting Party (JMP), have been ongoing in <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/784383.stm">Yemen</a> [BBC Profile] since February, largely calling for Saleh to step down. Saleh has been in power since 1978 and is considered popular in Yemen and the international community. However, he and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC) have caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission. Although the government has maintained control urban areas, the northern and southern parts of the country remain unlawful and dangerous, plagued by southern separatists groups and <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Due to this, Saleh and Yemen have allied to the US in the war on terror, accepting military aid and allowing drone strikes to defeat al Qaeda.

The Americans, taken as hostages, were later killed by the pirates, the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive]. The suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, were charged with piracy, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and the use of firearms during a crime. A juvenile who participated was <a href = "http://www.wavy.com/dpp/news/local_news/accused-pirates-may-face-Norfolk-judge">not charged</a> [<EM>WAVY</Em> report] due to his minor status and limited role in the hijacking. A conviction of piracy attaches a mandatory life sentence. In a <A href = "http://norfolk.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel11/nf031011.htm">press release</a> [text], FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office <a href = "http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/fedarcyk">Janice Fedarcyk</a> [official profile] said:<blockquote>Modern day piracy has real and serious consequences, disrupting commerce and threatening Americans' lives. It is a crime against the international community, a form of terrorism on the high seas. Today's charges should send a clear message to those who attempt to engage in piracy against Americans or American vessels: even on the open ocean, you are not beyond the reach of American justice.</blockquote>Federal prosecutor <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/usattorney.html">Neil MacBride</a> [official profile] stated that more charges could be filed. There have been seven convictions of pirates in the US, with <A href = "/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">five awaiting sentencing</a> [JURIST report]. The other two received <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-30-years.php">30-</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-nearly-34-years.php">34-year</a> sentences [JURIST reports]. 

<p>Piracy near the continent of Africa has become an increasingly serious problem for private shipowners and many nations. In January, the UN Secretary-General's special adviser on maritime piracy <a href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sga1260.doc.htm">Jack Lang</a> [official profile] proposed an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/un-expert-calls-for-international-maritime-piracy-court.php">international piracy court</a> [JURIST report]. Due to the lack of such a court, several nations have been conducting piracy trials. A <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">German court began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 10 suspected Somali pirates in that country's first piracy trial in 400 years in November. A <A href = "/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Yemeni court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a group of 10 Somali pirates to five years in prison. Prior to these trials, Kenya was conducting the bulwark of piracy trials. However, the high court of Mombasa ruled that <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-court-rules-no-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenya does not have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] outside of its national waters, releasing nine suspected Somali pirates. Other nations that have conducted such trials include the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-court-begins-europes-first-somali-pirate-trial.php">Netherlands</a>, <A href = "/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a>, and <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a letter addressed to Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez, the ACLU asked the DOJ to conclude its investigation into rights abuses <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Human_Rights_Crisis_in_Puerto_Rico_-_ACLU_re-edited_March_7_2011.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.aclu-pr.org/EN/Home.htm">ACLU of Puerto Rico</a> [advocacy website] since 2008 and publish a report of its findings. It also urged the DOJ to intervene to provide remedies to end the alleged police abuses which include: violence against student protestors; the fabrication of drug-related charges against over a 100 individuals in the city of Mayaguez; the violent and inhumane eviction of members of the Villas del Sol squatter community, including the denial of fresh water to the community for eight months; and actions the de-certification of the <a href="http://www.capr.org/">Puerto Rico Bar Association</a> [official website, in Spanish] and other actions to stifle dissent. The letter continued:<blockquote>Clearly, these allegations raise troubling questions about the Puerto Rican government's commitment to the human rights of its citizens and the First Amendment's protections of freedom of assembly, expression and the right to petition the government. We hope that DOJ will soon conclude its investigation and intervene into these unconstitutional practices.</blockquote> The ACLU also expressed concerns over actions by the administration of Puerto Rican <a href="http://www.fortaleza.gobierno.pr/2011/">Governor Luis Fortuno</a> (R) [official website, in Spanish]. Since he took office in 2009, the ACLU alleges that police have reacted violently to protests against the closure of legislative sessions to the public despite constitutional guarantees to the contrary and student protests against fee increases at the <a href="http://www.upr.edu/">University of Puerto Rico</a> (UPR) [academic website, in Spanish]. Residents of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated US territory, are US citizens and have the same federal <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] rights in relation to the island's government as a mainland US citizen would have against a state government. 

<p>Last week, US <a href="http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/">Representative Luis Gutierrez</a> (D-IL) [official website] <a href="http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=645%3Aremarks-by-rep-luis-v-gutierrez&catid=48&Itemid=72">reiterated his earlier criticism</a> [statement text] of the actions of the Puerto Rico government and entered the ACLU report into the Congressional Record. During his earlier statement, Gutierrez also criticized a ruling of Chief Judge Jose Fuste of the <a href="http://www.prd.uscourts.gov/CourtWeb/Welcome.aspx">US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico</a> [official website], who he <a href="http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642%3Aremarks-by-rep-luis-v-gutierrez&catid=48&Itemid=72">alleged to be complicit in the rights abuses</a> [statement text] by the Fortuno administration. Puerto Rico has faced <a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/apuntolainvestigacionfederalsobrelapoliciaboricua-898884.html">several major protests in recent years</a> [<em>El Nuevo Dia</em> report, in Spanish] as students and state workers demonstrate against government policies which have seen significant cuts in funding to UPR and reductions in the state workforce. The cuts were part of an attempt to reduce a $2 billion budget deficit. Following the cuts to the university, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/education/18puertorico.html">UPR students engaged in a strike</a> [NYT report] after it was announced that new student fees would be used to fill the budget shortfall. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12701803">gave its closing arguments</a> [BBC report] where it said Taylor was an intelligent many who had fooled many people and relied on fooling the judges in this case. In its closing arguments, the defense argued that witnesses against Taylor <a href="http://www.charlestaylortrial.org/2011/03/10/defense-concludes-closing-arguments-attacks-credibility-of-prosecution-witnesses-2/">had been rewarded</a> [OSJI report] by the court for their participation in the trial. The defense noted that all international tribunals reimburse witnesses for reasonable expenses related to their participation but argued that it appeared the witnesses against Taylor had actually profited making their testimony unreliable. The defense pointed to payments of some witnesses for "appreciation" as an example that witnesses were given gifts for providing evidence. Taylor has argued that the charges against him are politically motivated. The judges adjourned to deliberate on the verdict, which is expected to take several months. Taylor could face life imprisonment if convicted.

<p>The closing arguments, which were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/closing-arguments-begin-in-trial-of-former-liberian-president-taylor-enters.php">originally set to begin last month</a>, had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pending-appeal-delays-closing-trial-of-former-liberian-president.php">postponed</a> pending an appeals chamber decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-to-hear-defense-closing-arguments.php">accept the defense's final written brief</a> [JURIST reports] after the trial chamber disregarded the brief because it was 20 days late. Taylor has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">charges</a> [indictment, PDF] against him, which include murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism stemming from from a "campaign to terrorize the civilian population" of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sierra+Leone">Sierra Leone</a> [JURIST news archive]. Taylor's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">opened their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 and have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia. His trial continued after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-denies.php">denied his motion for acquittal</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill requires state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and eliminates the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increases, which would be capped by the Consumer Price Index. The legislation is an amended version of <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/JR1SB-11.pdf">SB 11</a> [text, PDF], a fiscal proposal by Walker which sparked intense nationwide legal and political controversy over provisions limiting the collective bargaining rights of state workers. The controversy deepened when the 14 Democrats of the state Senate left the state in order to deny the Republican majority the required quorum to pass a budget item. The amended legislation <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/11/AR2011031103966.html">purports to have removed the budget elements</a> [WP report] of SB 11, leaving only the provisions affecting collective bargaining rights and requiring employee payments into pension and health benefits, allowing the Senate to vote on it without the 14 Democrats present. The legislation was passed by the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/">State Legislature</a> [official website] on Thursday with a vote of 53-42 in the Assembly and 18-1 in the Senate. The procedure used to pass the bill has already faced a <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">challenge</a> [complaint, PDF] in state court under the <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">Open Meeting Law</a> [Wis. Stat. &#167; 19.81-19.98], which requires that a 24-hour public notice be given for public meetings. Plaintiffs also alleged that the bill still contained fiscal provisions requiring the three-fifths quorum denied in the Democrats' absence. The judge <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/117798133.html?referrer=reddit">denied the requested restraining order</a> [<em>Journal Sentinel</em> report] and ordered further hearings on March 16. 

<p>The provisions limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since February 15, when SB 11 was introduced to address the state's $3.6 billion deficit. Earlier this month, a Wisconsin judge ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-orders-capitol-building-open-to-public.php">state capitol building must remain open</a> [JURIST report] to the public during business hours, despite an attempt to close the building to protesters who had occupied it as part of a protest against the proposed restrictions on collective bargaining. The <a href="http://www.wseu-24.org/">Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24</a> (WSUE) [advocacy website] filed the petition earlier in the day in reaction to Walker ordering the capitol building closed and removing protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsenateseal.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/">Senator John McCain</a> (R-AZ) [official website], along with five cosponsors, introduced legislation Thursday that would prohibit funding for civilian trials of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees and place restrictions on the transfer of detainees to foreign countries. The <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:551:./list/bss/d112SN.lst::">Military Detainee Procedures Improvement Act of 2011</a> [S 551 materials] would require "greater scrutiny on the security situation and ability of the host country to monitor a detainee" after transfer from Guantanamo. It also purports to "[r]eaffirm[] the President's authority to detain members of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and affiliated terrorist groups based on the authority granted by Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military Force." The legislation would require members of terrorists groups affiliated with <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda-k-al-qaida-al-qaida/p9126">al Qaeda</a> and the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/taliban-afghanistan/p10551">Taliban</a> [CFR backgrounders] to be held in military custody when captured, would impose restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to other countries and would require annual review of whether detainees can be released. The bill would also establish "the authority [for the President] to target and take lethal action against individuals" such as <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/anwar_al_Awlaki/index.html">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Anwar+al-Awlaki">news archive</a>]. Awlaki, a dual US-Yemeni citizen, has been approved for targeting killing by the Obama administration, an action that has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">challenged based on Awlaki's US citizenship</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=a13898e1-a127-1aec-99b2-56b51f4ca4b9&Region_id=&Issue_id=">Explaining the reasons for the bill</a> [press release], McCain said:<blockquote>This much-needed legislation would improve our current ad hoc military detention system for members of al-Qaeda and their affiliated terrorist groups, by enacting these policies and procedures firmly into law. Our legislation addresses difficult detainee issues, including long-term detention and carefully controlled transfers, emphasizing supervision, security, rehabilitation, and reintegration, so former detainees do not return to the battlefield - as approximately 25 percent of detainees released from Guantanamo have done.</blockquote>The bill has been referred to the Senate <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Armed Services Committee</a> [official website]. 

<p>On Monday, President Barack Obama issued an executive order <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-orders-resumption-of-guantanamo-military-trials.php">allowing the resumption of military commissions</a> [JURIST report] for Guantanamo detainees. New charges in the military commission system had been suspended since shortly after Obama took office in 2009. Monday's order also establishes a procedure for establishing a review process for detainees who have not been charged, convicted or designated for transfer. In March 2010, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] urged the administration to abandon military commissions, calling the system <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">"fatally flawed" and beyond hope of reform</a> [JURIST report]. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Maryland <a href="http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/05sen/html/sen.html">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/maryland-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">voted 25-21 to approve</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/billfile/SB0116.htm">Civil Marriage Protection Act</a> [materials] last month and sent it to the lower house for a final vote. The failure to approve the bill makes it unlikely that the legislation will be approved before the next session, scheduled for 2012. The bill was <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GAY_MARRIAGE_MARYLAND?SITE=NYWNE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">withdrawn from the House</a> [AP report] before the planned vote. The bill would have needed an affirmative vote from the House of Delegates and to be signed by the governor before becoming law. In addition to legalizing same-sex marriage, the bill would have allowed a religious institution to refuse services, accommodations or solemnization of a marriage that would violate constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion. Maryland <a href="http://governor.maryland.gov/index.asp">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> (D) [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/pressreleases/110311a.asp">opposed the decision not to pass the bill</a> [press release]: <blockquote>It is my firm belief that equality under the law means equality for everyone, and our laws should reflect that fundamental principle. Together, we've worked hard to protect and expand these rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered citizens in our state. It was my hope to sign a marriage equality act consistent with these progressive reforms, while protecting religious freedom in our state.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.equalitymaryland.org/2011/3/11/equality-maryland-vows-to-keep-up-fight-for-marriage">Equality Maryland</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu-md.org/aPress/Press2011/031111_marriage.html">American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland</a> [press releases] expressed disappointment at the bill's failure. The <a href="http://www.nationformarriage.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=omL2KeN0LzH&b=5075189&ct=9175599">National Organization for Marriage</a> [press release] praised the actions of the Maryland delegates.

<p>In February 2010, Maryland <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/">Attorney General Douglas Gansler</a> [official website] declared that the state would <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/maryland-should-recognize-out-of-state.php">recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere</a> [JURIST report]. Had the bill succeeded, Maryland would have become the seventh US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriage.

The appeals court has yet not made a decision regarding the request that the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/faster-health-care-appeal-asked/">initial review be heard <em>en banc</em></a> [SCOTUSblog report] before all 10 judges. Last Friday, Judge Roger Vinson <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-stays-earlier-injunction-against-health-care-reform-act.php">stayed his ruling</a> finding that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">health care law was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports] on the condition that an appeal would be filed within a week. The stay has allowed the administration to continue its implementation of the law in other states until after appellate review. Also on Friday, the 26 states that won before Vinson filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fla.-health-notice-of-appeal-ND-Fla-DCt.pdf">notice of cross appeal</a> [notice, PDF], appealing the "adverse disposition of claims."

In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW went on to describe witness accounts of Egyptian soldiers and others in civilian clothing attacking demonstrators, finding that "[t]he Supreme Military Council has been ignoring credible reports of arbitrary arrest and torture, ... [t]here can be no break from the abuses of the past while security forces &#8212; including military personnel &#8212; abuse people with impunity."

<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] has vociferously <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-urges-international-protection-for-middle-east-protesters.php">decried the use of violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in recent months as protests have spread across the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder].

The <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2011/03/KIN11099.pdf">Student Non-Discrimination Act</a> (SNDA) [materials] was reintroduced in both the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/Welcome.shtml">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official websites] prompted by the suicides resulting from anti-LGBT bullying of several students in the past year. The SNDA is modeled after <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleIX.htm">Title IX</a> [20 USC &#167; 1681 <em>et seq.</em>] of the Education Amendments of 1972 and would establish a comprehensive federal prohibition of discrimination against LGBT students in public schools. The act would also prohibit schools from discriminating against students based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as prohibit schools from ignoring harassment. If enacted into law, violations of the SNDA would result in the loss of federal funding and provide a legal cause of action for victims who encounter discrimination in public schools. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/ACLU_Letter_of_Support_for_the_Student_Non-Discrimination_Act_House_-_112th.pdf">supports the legislation</a> [letter, PDF] and decries the treatment of LGBT students in public schools:<blockquote>The recent tragic deaths of young gay students from across the country underscore the fact that LGBT students are an especially vulnerable population in our nation's schools. Discrimination and harassment, even physical abuse, are often a part of these students' daily lives. ... The Student Non-Discrimination Act would have a profound impact in improving the lives of LGBT students by ensuring that discrimination and harassment of students on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity has no place in our country's public elementary and secondary schools.</blockquote>The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04530:">legislation was first introduced</a> [HR 4530 materials] in the 111th Congress and currently has 99 co-sponsors in the House and 27 co-sponsors in the Senate.

<p>President Barack Obama, lawmakers, students and parents convened on Thursday to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/10/president-and-first-lady-call-united-effort-address-bullying">discuss measures to combat bullying</a> [press release]. Several state and federal legislators have introduced similar bills aimed at preventing bullying in public schools. Texas State <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=147">Representative Garnet Coleman</a> [official profile] introduced a <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/Search/DocViewer.aspx?K2DocKey=odbc%3a%2f%2fTLO%2fTLO.dbo.vwCurrBillDocs%2f82%2fR%2fH%2fB%2f01386%2f1%2fB%40TloCurrBillDocs&QueryText=HB+1386&HighlightType=1">bill</a> [text, PDF] in February to ban anti-LGBT bullying, harassment and discrimination in public schools, as well as develop a suicide prevention program for middle, junior and high schools. The Massachusetts <a href="http://www.malegislature.gov/people/house">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in March 2010 <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2010/03/19/bullying_bill_okd_in_house_148_to_0/">unanimously passed a bill</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] seeking to prevent bullying in schools and cyberspace. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Kohring was caught on tape accepting cash from Bill Allen, an executive for Alaskan oil services and engineering company <a href="http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/energy/veco.asp">VECO Corp.</a> [official website]. The court held that Kohring was unfairly denied access to evidence which would have helped his defense, including information which casts doubt on Allen's credibility:<blockquote>[E]vidence of Allen's sexual misconduct with a minor would have shed light on the magnitude of Allen's incentive to cooperate with authorities and would have revealed that he had much more at stake than was already known to the jury. Beyond facing serious criminal charges, the newly-disclosed information shows Allen was very distressed at the prospect of his alleged sexual misconduct becoming public ... The newly-disclosed information also illustrates Allen's difficulty with remembering key facts, as well as Allen's and Smith's differing (and sometimes changing) recollections as to how much money they paid Kohring. Setting aside for a moment the question of the information's admissibility, the information is exculpatory and has impeachment value.</blockquote>The court found that Kohring's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] Confrontation Clause rights were violated, ruling that knowledge of Allen's sexual misconduct, as well as the newly-revealed information about Allen's memory regarding the financial exchange, would have helped Kohring challenge his credibility as a witness and allow the jury to more fairly evaluate how heavily it would weight his testimony.

<p>Kohring was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/us/02brfs-EXLAWMAKERIS_BRF.html?_r=2&scp=5&sq=Kohring,%20Alaska&st=cse">convicted</a> [NYT report] in November 2007 and sentenced to 42 months in federal prison on extortion, bribery and conspiracy charges, based largely on <a href="http://community.adn.com/mini_apps/vmix/player.php?ID=1551327&GID=118">FBI video surveillance</a> [ADN video archive] evidence. But in 2009, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] asked the court to remand the case of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/June/09-ag-550.html">two convicted Alaska lawmakers</a> [press release], including Kohring, to district court and to release the prisoners on their own recognizance, admitting that DOJ prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/doj-asks-ninth-circuit-to-remand.php">did not disclose all necessary information</a> [JURIST report]. Several other Alaska lawmakers, as well as VECO's CEO Bill Allen and Vice President Rick Smith, prominent lawyer Jim Clark, and several high profile lobbyists, were also <a href="http://community.adn.com/adn/node/112569">indicted, convicted, or pleaded guilty</a> [ADN backgrounder] to corruption-related charges.  In April 2009, the DOJ dropped the charges against former Alaska senator <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=s000888">Ted Stevens</a> [US Congress backgrounder] when <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/04/doj-moves-to-set-aside-verdict-against.php">similar errors were discovered</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Arab League declared that Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaddafi">news archive</a>] has been using aircraft to combat civilian protesting, and it is <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/7581/World/Region/League-bows-to-Arab-popular-will,-calls-for-nofly-.aspx">the UN's responsibility</a> [Ahram Online report] to stabilize the situation. In addition to requesting help from the UN, the resolution called on Arab and other international organizations to give humanitarian aid to the Libyan people and to help those trying to leave Libya. The resolution marks a shift in action for the Arab League, which has not responded to the <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur genocide</a> [JURIST news archive], among other high-profile international issues. The current UN response has been to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council</a> and to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">refer the situation</a> [JURIST reports] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], which some scholars argue is <a href="/forum/2011/03/libya-and-un-sanctions-fair-play-or-unfair-politics.php">hypocritical</a> [JURIST op-ed] and shows the need for a more uniform application of international law.

<p>The UN on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">appointed a team of special prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations that Gaddafi has ordered forces to torture and abduct opponents. Although a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">probe was launched</a> [JURIST report] earlier in March by the ICC, special rapporteur for torture <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/juanmendes.shtml">Juan Mendez</a> [UN profile] <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110309/ap_on_re_eu/un_un_libya_torture">clarified</a> [AP Report] that this probe is different because he and his fellow investigators are "independent experts" focusing on accusations that Gaddafi has ordered hospital patients' executions, fired on crowds of protesters and used other extreme tactics against his opponents. Protests in Libya began in February following those that have occurred throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], resulting in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports].

US National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor immediately <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/maryland-contractor-alan-gross-draws-15-year-sentence-in-cuba/2011/03/12/ABL6lMS_story.html">denounced the ruling</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report], calling the 15-year sentence an "injustice." Gross was arrested at the Havana Airport in 2009 for bringing computer equipment into Cuba. He was working as a member of a <a href="http://www.dai.com/">Development Alternatives Incorporated</a> (DAI) [official website]  program distributing computer and satellite phone equipment to Jewish residents in Cuba in an effort to give them Internet access. The sentence has increased the political strain between US and Cuban relations. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hilary Clinton</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1wZHL7jXITBJdzEo1iCD4ygpOEg?docId=CNG.85ddb96fcf52faa20dc5e18c4a347c88.331">called for Gross's immediate release</a> [AP report] and several US officials have stated that relations will not improve until Gross is released. DAI President and Chief Executive Officer James Boomgard <a href="http://www.dai.com/about/newsroom.php?nid=443">urged the Cuban government to immediately release Gross</a> [press release]: <blockquote>We are profoundly disappointed by today's verdict and sentence. Alan Gross has been accused of doing nothing more than giving peaceful people access to the internet, and for this he has already been unjustly imprisoned for more than a year without the benefit of due process and in violation of international law. In light of the critical medical situation confronting Alan and his family, we urge the Cuban government to release him immediately on humanitarian grounds and quickly return him to his family.</blockquote> The US hopes that Gross will soon be released on humanitarian grounds. 

<p>Until recently, the historically strained relations between the US and Cuba had shown signs of improvement. Earlier this year, President Obama [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Departments of <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State</a>, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury</a>, and <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Homeland Security</a> [official websites] to take steps to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/14/reaching-out-cuban-people">ease restrictions on travel and remittances</a> [press release] to Cuba. The new regulations, to be promulgated as modifications of the <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr515_main_02.tpl">Cuban Assets Control</a> [31 CFR &#167; 515.101 et seq.] and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=8b684ec5c62f1adda0d3984257ecc67f&rgn=div6&view=text&node=19:1.0.1.1.21.15&idno=19">Customs and Border Protection</a> [19 CFR &#167; 122.151 et seq.] regulations, will allow greater travel from the US to Cuba for religious and educational purposes, the transfer of up to $2000 per year to non-family members in Cuba so long as they are not senior government or Communist Party leaders, and will allow all US international airports to service charter flights between the two countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cuccinelli is requesting that the University turn over records about global warming researcher <a href="http://www.met.psu.edu/people/mem45">Dr. Michael Mann</a> [official profile], now a professor at Penn State University, in an effort to investigate allegations that Mann received improper public funds for his global warming research. Last year, retired Albemarle County Circuit Court Judge Paul M. Peatross Jr. <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010-08-30%20Opinion%20Granting%20UVA%20Petition.pdf">dismissed the request</a> [opinion, PDF] citing Cuccinelli's failure to establish a reasonable belief that fraud had occurred, but held that the University could be a proper target of a fraud investigation. Cuccinelli has argued that Virginia's 2002 <a href="http://www.taf.org/virginiafca.htm">Fraud Against Taxpayers Act</a> [materials], allows him to subpoena any records to help determine whether a civil fraud investigation is needed. The University hopes that court will set limits on what documents the Attorney General can demand in a civil investigation. Critics of the lawsuit have accused Cuccinelli, a global warming skeptic, of <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2011/03/va_supreme_court_will_hear_u-v.html">targeting Mann because of his research</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. The Virginia Supreme Court will hear the case later this spring.

<p>Cuccinelli is also leading a multi-state effort to overturn the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Health+Care">news archive</a>]. In February, Cuccinelli <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition for a <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/24454%20pdf%20McCullough.pdf">writ of certiorari</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the health care reform law on an expedited basis, before the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit [official website] rules on the issue. Cuccinelli <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/PRESS_RELEASES/Cuccinelli/020311_HealthCare_Expedited.html">based his request</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-to-ask-supreme-court-for-immediate-review-of-health-care-case.php">report</a>] on the far-reaching public policy implications inherent in the implementation of the legislation and the potential cost to the states as uncertainty surrounding the legislation's constitutionality remains.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission would be tasked with investigating and prosecuting election-related abuses, including violence. Presidential elections are scheduled in Nigeria for April 9, while voting for National Assembly members will occur on April 2, and voting for state governors and state assembly representatives will occur on April 16. These will be the first elections since the death of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">Umaru Yar'Adua</a> [BBC obituary] in May. Former vice president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12192152">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goodluck+jonathan">news archive</a>] assumed the presidency in February 2010 after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-vp-takes-over-for-ailing.php">parliament voted</a> [JURIST report] for him to step in for the ailing Yar'Adua. Previous elections in Nigeria have been marred by <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-state-elections-marred-by.php">violence</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. HRW Senior West Africa Researcher Corinne Dufka said:<blockquote>The National Assembly should use the last few weeks before elections in April to end the history of electoral impunity and to create an independent Electoral Offences Commission. Failure to do so would risk further entrenching violence and corruption in the electoral process and continue the disenfranchisement of Nigerian citizens.</blockquote>According to HRW, more than 50 people have been killed since November in politically-motivated and election-related violence.  

<p>In November, a judge for Nigeria's <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/High%20Courts.htm">Federal High Court</a> [official website] in Lagos <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nigeria-court-rules-national-assembly-amendments-cannot-become-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an amendment to the 1999 Nigerian <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Constitution</a> [text] made by NASS cannot become operational law without the assent of the president. The amendment, known as the <a href="http://placng.org/gazzette%20of%20the%20electoral%20act.pdf">Constitution (First Amendment) Act 2010</a> [text, PDF] was passed in June. It repeals the Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2006 in order to re-instate the Nigerian <a href="http://www.inecnigeria.org/">Independent National Election Commission</a> (INEC) [official website]. Also in June, the legislature <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/nigeria-senate-passes-revisions-clarifying-presidential-succession.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] revisions to the constitution to clarify the exercise of executive authority in absence of the president. The constitutional revisions changed federal election law by removing a provision of the constitution that disallowed people who had been charged with fraud from standing for election and requiring candidates for federal office to have a degree beyond secondary education.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf's claims <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12716033">raise questions</a> [BBC report] over UK's public stance discouraging other countries from torturing UK citizens on its behalf. Musharraf, who was president of Pakistan from 1999-2008 and a key US ally against al Qaeda, told the BBC that he was never informed of the UK's policy discouraging torture and defended the use of torture to fight al Qaeda. But Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller, head of UK intelligence <a href = "https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] at the time, denied that it turned a blind-eye to torture by other countries. Claims that the UK allowed torture by other countries will be investigated by an independent commission set to begin work within the next two months. One of those believed to have been tortured with UK acquiescence was <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">Binyam Mohamed</a> [JURIST news archive], an Ethiopian native who had lived in the UK for eight years. He has claimed he was tortured by US officials at <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] with the knowledge of UK security services. He has denied allegations against him and claims he made false admissions under the duress of torture.

<p>Musharraf himself has come under scrutiny during his time as Pakistan president. Last month, an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-issues-arrest-warrant-for-former-president-musharraf-in-death-of-bhutto.php">arrest warrant was issued</a> [JURIST report] for Musharraf by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court in connection with the assassination of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>]. The court determined Musharraf had not cooperated during the investigation of Bhutto's death, and investigators have alleged that Musharraf did not provide adequate security for Bhutto when she was assassinated during a campaign rally in Pakistan in 2007. Last December, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">agreed to settlements</a> [JURIST report] with 16 Guantanamo Bay detainees, including Mohamed, over allegations of torture. Details of the settlement agreement, which are legally bound to a confidentiality agreement, have not been released, although at least seven detainees are expected to receive compensation, with at least one receiving over one million pounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawmakers, members of the pro-government Independent Bloc, <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/en/news/449830">called on Khalifa to invoke martial law</a> [BNA report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and deploy the Bahrain Defense Force to ensure national security and preserve state institutions. The call came after 5,000 protesters demanded an end to the monarch Sunday, following over a month of protests in Bahrain and throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder]. On Monday, the member states of the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], which includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786">deployed troops to Bahrain</a> [BBC report] for the purpose of guarding oil installations and financial institutions. 

<p>The Bahraini government's response to the protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">called for an end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region. Ban said that he is "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists." In conjunction, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], condemned violence by security forces in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen against anti-government demonstrators as illegal and excessively heavy-handed. Pillay also stressed that Bahrain has an obligation to respect human rights as a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors alleged that the two men, Justin Cannon and Christopher Drotleff, left their military base without authorization and opened fire into the back of a civilian car after a traffic accident. The driver of the car and a civilian bystander were killed, and a passenger in the car was wounded. Cannon and Drotleff claim that they were defending themselves. They were <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pr/documents/01-07-10Cannon-Drotleff-Indictment.pdf">originally indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in January 2010, but were charged under the <a href="http://www.pubklaw.com/hi/pl106-523.pdf">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> [text, PDF] in a superseding indictment in August. Both men were acquitted of two counts of second-degree murder, assault resulting in serious bodily injury to the passenger and firearms offenses, but were convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the death of the driver. The men could be sentenced to a maximum of eight years in prison.

<p>Cannon and Drostleff were initially tried in September, but the judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-declares-mistrial-in-murder-case-against-blackwater-contractors.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] after the jury failed to reach a verdict. In April, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In February 2010, the Iraqi government ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report] in reaction to the dismissal of charges against former Blackwater employees <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">accused in the deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in 2007.

Ali Abdullah's sentence was based on allegations that he <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jk_rIV7SptKDuJ8CnrQ2PtabM91Q?docId=6236956">made critical comments against Iran</a> [AP report], thereby harming Syria's relations with a foreign country. Abdullah, an outspoken member of the "Damascus Declaration" group, previously served a 30 month sentence for his criticisms of the Syrian government. He is not the only member of the "Damascus Declaration" group, known for its 2005 declaration calling for Syria's transition into a democratic nation and improved relations with neighboring Lebanon, to be punished. In January 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/syria-arrests-pro-democracy-former.php">Syrian government arrested</a> [JURIST report] former parliamentarian and dissident Riyad Sayf, also a prominent member of the group, and, in 2007, a Syrian court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/syria-court-sentences-dissidents-for.php">sentenced writer and activist Michel Kilo</a> [JURIST report], who was arrested after signing the group's Beirut-Damascus Declaration, to a prison term of three years for "speaking false news, weakening national feeling and inciting sectarian sentiments."

<p>Over the past several years, Syria has increased its prosecution of political dissidents, drawing strong criticism from the international community. However, in an interview last month, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad indicated he would push for political reforms including <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/08/syria-facebook-unbanned-people">municipal elections and a new media law</a> [CP report]. Soon after the interview, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">Internet users reported</a> [JURIST report] that social media sites <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=facebook">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] were accessible without proxy servers or VPNs. This news made it appear as though Syria was lifting the ban imposed in 2007 as a <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=2&articleId=73460">concession to avoid popular upheaval</a> [DP report] in the country. Because both Facebook and YouTube are routinely accessed by Syrians through international proxy servers, the concession may have limited impact. Other websites, such as Amazon and Wikipedia, remain blocked for the time being.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the attack on their home, Adil was beaten, and the family was locked in their gasoline-drenched house. The Kovacs fled to the woods where their grandmother was murdered and Kovac's son was shot in the leg. After the incident, the Kovacs left Bosnia and acquired French citizenship, beginning their civil suit against <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Karadzic</a>, <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/plavsic/cis/en/cis_plavsic.pdf">Plavsic</a>, <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> and <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/cis/en/cis_krajisnik_en.pdf">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [ICTY materials] for 1,000,000 euros six years ago. The court found sufficient evidence that Karadzic and Plavsic were personally responsible for the harm suffered by the Kovacs. The court requested additional evidence the determine Mladic's responsibility and declared itself incompetent to hear the case against Krajisnik. The decision must now be accepted by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and communicated to Karadzic and Plavsic.

<p>The court's ruling may pave the way for victims of war crimes to obtain civil compensation from war criminals without a criminal trial. Karadzic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 war crimes charges</a> [indictment, PDF], including counts of genocide and murder, for alleged crimes he committed during the war in BiH. Karadzic is defending himself in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and has denied all of the charges against him. After <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-suspends-karadzic-trial-for-6-weeks.php">multiple</a> <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icty-delays-karadzic-trial-for-one-month.php">suspensions</a> [JURIST reports], Karadzic's trial is expected to last through 2012. In 2009, Plavsic was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/former-bosnian-serb-president-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from a Swedish prison after serving two-thirds of her sentence for war crimes committed between July 1991 and December 1992. Plavsic voluntarily surrendered herself to the ICTY in 2001 and was sentenced to 11 years in a Swedish prison. The ICTY agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icty-approves-release-of-former-bosnian.php">grant her release</a> [JURIST report], citing good behavior and "substantial evidence of rehabilitation." In 2010, the ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/presdec/en/100726.pdf">denied</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-denies-early-release-of-former-serb-parliament-head.php">report</a>] early release to Krajisnik who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTY in 2006 to 27 years in a British prison for his role in the forced evacuation and displacement of several thousand Muslims and Croatians, including women and children. The ICTY <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/09/former-bosnia-serb-leader-transferred.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] Krajisnik's sentence to 20 years in 2009, transferring him to a UK prison to serve his time.

Kuvjela and members of his police company allegedly took the individuals to a warehouse known as "the White House" and physically abused them. Kuvjela and others then killed more than a thousand men the next day and coerced survivors to exit the building with the promise of medical assistance. The men were executed when they exited the building, and Kuvjela allegedly took part in "verifying" whether each man was still alive and shot those who had survived.

The warning follows a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summons</a> [JURIST report]  issued by the ICC last week for the suspects to appear before the court on April 7 for an initial hearing. All six are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of violence after the election. In December, Moreno-Ocampo identified the six suspects, which include current Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and several ministry heads. Due to concerns over witness interference, the court granted the requests for conditions that prohibit the suspects from threatening the witnesses or influencing any witness through corrupt measures. The ICC judges, however, rejected the prosecutor's request that would prohibit the suspects from having contact with one another. Moreno-Ocampo still suspects that abuse of governmental power could negatively affect the case and intends to further investigate several of the ministry heads' involvement with the Kenyan police and the witness protection program. 

<p>The Kenyan government has <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/kenya-to-challenge-icc-summons.php">announced that they will challenge</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.communication.go.ke/media.asp?id=1274&media_type=2">admissibility of cases</a> [press release] relating to the post-election violence as well as the jurisdiction of the court. In December, the <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/">Kenyan Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kenya-lawmakers-approve-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] the country from the ICC. In November, the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, which implicated former Cabinet minster William Ruto of interfering with the ICC investigation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-rights-group-accuses-official-of-interfering-with-icc-election-investigation.php">denied accusations that it had bribed witnesses</a> [JURIST report]. Moreno-Campo had also said that the court will <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-prosecutor-says-court-will-not-use-testimony-of-allegedly-bribed-kenya-witnesses.php">not use testimony</a> [JURIST report] from three Kenyan witnesses who claim they were bribed to provide false evidence against a high-ranking government official.

In an opinion piece published by the <em>Arizona Daily Star</em>, Obama called for the implementation of "sound and effective steps" aimed at minimizing gun violence. He outlined three steps designed to enhance the effectiveness of the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/nics">National Instant Criminal Background Check System</a> (NICS) [FBI backgrounder], a database that provides information to gun sellers about potential buyers' eligibility to purchase firearms. Obama called for proper implementation of NICS and an incentive system to reward the states that provide the best information to the database. He also called for the system to be made "faster and nimbler ... provid[ing] an instant, accurate, comprehensive and consistent system for background checks." Addressing the often divisive nature of gun rights discussions in the US, Obama said that he has faith that Americans on both sides of the debate can recognize that "[m]ost gun-control advocates know that most gun owners are responsible citizens [and m]ost gun owners know that the word 'commonsense' isn't a code word for 'confiscation.' And none of us should be willing to remain passive in the face of violence or resigned to watching helplessly as another rampage unfolds on television."

<p>Following the Arizona shooting, lawmakers have largely <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2011/01/lawmakers_sidestep_calls_for_t.html">remained silent</a> [AP report] on issues of firearms reform. This marks the first time Obama has directly addressed reform since the shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 were wounded, including US Congresswoman <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [official website]. Earlier this month, federal prosecutors filed a <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20110304-loughner-charges.pdf?ref=us">49-count indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/new-indictment-filed-against-accused-arizona-shooter.php">report</a>] against the suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner. The new indictment carries more severe charges than the <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/27938/loughner-indictment.pdf">original indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/accused-arizona-gunman-indicted.php">report</a>] filed in January, accounting for all victims of the attack and carrying more serious penalties. Prosecutors first <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">filed charges against Loughner</a> [JURIST report] in January. Loughner has pleaded not guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men received an additional 80 years each for firearms and other piracy-related charges. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/">US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] Neil MacBride <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/Pressreleases/03-MarchPDFArchive/11/20110314hasannr.html">expressed approval</a> [press release] of the tough sentencing:<blockquote>Today's sentences should send a clear message to those who attempt to engage in piracy: Armed attacks on U.S.-flagged vessels carry severe consequences in U.S. courts. Modern-day pirates not only threaten human lives but also disrupt international commerce by extorting hundreds of millions of dollars in ransom payments. It is believed that between 650 to 800 people are held hostage by Somali pirates and that the global cost of piracy is as high as $12 billion annually.</blockquote>Last week, US District Judge Mark Davis rejected an appeal by the men to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/03/11/national/a102538S00.DTL">overturn their convictions</a> [AP report]. The defense had argued that the men did not board or rob the frigate and cited a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/">Congressional Research Service</a> [official website] report that suggested that the 1819 definition of privacy may be outdated. Davis rejected this argument, citing that the report did not contain any original substantive legal analysis. 

<p>The five men were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted on charges of piracy</a> [JURIST report] in November, the first such conviction in the US in nearly 200 years. The men were found guilty on charges of piracy, attacking to plunder a maritime vessel and assault with a dangerous weapon for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nicholas, which was deployed to combat piracy in waters off the eastern coast of Africa. Last week, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-court-indicts-14-suspected-pirates.php">indicted 14 suspects</a> [JURIST report] for overtaking a yacht containing four Americans. The case involves the first US citizen to die in recent wave of international piracy. In January, the UN Secretary-General's special adviser on maritime piracy <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sga1260.doc.htm">Jack Lang</a> [official profile] proposed an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-expert-calls-for-international-maritime-piracy-court.php">international piracy court</a> [JURIST report]. Due to the lack of such a court, several nations have been conducting piracy trials. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">German court began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 10 suspected Somali pirates in that country's first piracy trial in 400 years in November. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Yemeni court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a group of 10 Somali pirates to five years in prison. Prior to these trials, Kenya was conducting the bulwark of piracy trials. However, the high court of Mombasa ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-court-rules-no-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenya does not have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] outside of its national waters, releasing nine suspected Somali pirates. Other nations that have conducted such trials include the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-court-begins-europes-first-somali-pirate-trial.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was brought on behalf of all individuals who were subjected to experimentation in Guatemala or were infected to be used as vehicles to infect test subjects for the venereal disease experiments. The complaint alleges that the PHS conducted the human medical experiments in Guatemala to test whether penicillin could also be used as a prophylaxis immediately following exposure to  the syphilis bacteria. The plaintiffs seek to establish similarities between their case and the "Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male" in the complaint. The complaint further alleges:<blockquote>Once the PHS learned what it wished from each Guatemalan subject's induced exposure, it may have provided penicillin to presumably cure the infection. However, the PHS provided little follow-up to ensure that the subjects were actually cured of their infection. How long the study continued and how long treatment, if any, was provided to those affected is not clear.</blockquote>The plaintiffs seek relief under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350], the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Fifth Amendment</a> and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Eighth Amendment</a> [materials]. The complaint asks the court to declare that their human rights were violated, award plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages, and permanently enjoin the defendants from further engaging in human rights abuses against plaintiffs and the people of Guatemala. 

<p><a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/Reverby%20Normal%20Exposure.pdf">Evidence of the PHS program</a> [report] was discovered by <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/fac_reverby.html">Professor Susan Reverby</a> [academic profile]. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11454789">apologized</a> [BBC report] to Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom for the testing. Reverby's study shows that the PHS infected more than 700 people in Guatemala with syphilis and gonorrhea. The patients were prisoners and people suffering from mental health problems and were unaware they were being tested.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ argues that the case is ineligible for early review under <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2010RulesoftheCourt.pdf">Supreme Court Rule 11</a> [text, PDF] which prevents the court from taking a case pending before a circuit court of appeals absent "a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to require immediate determination in this Court." The DOJ filed the brief in response to a February <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">petition for a writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] filed by Virginia <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli</a> [official website] seeking to send the case, which declared the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/12/13/va.healthcare.ruling.pdf">unconstitutional</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">report</a>], directly to the Supreme Court. Despite the case's public importance, those challenging the law seek only to have the individual mandate, which takes effect in 2014, declared unconstitutional, and, argues the DOJ, "[t]here will be ample time before 2014 for this Court to decide whether to grant review in the normal course and, if it does so, to issue a decision." The brief notes that three circuit courts have already agreed to hear expedited challenges and that, should the circuit courts be bypassed, there is no guarantee the Supreme Court will hear the case any sooner since the court will not have time to hear the case until next term at the earliest. The DOJ seeks to distinguish this case from other cases the court had heard early, claiming that, unlike the others, allowing this to go through the normal appeals process does not threaten to cause irreparable harm. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] is scheduled to hear the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">case</a> [Commonwealth v. Sebelius materials] in May.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/11th-circuit-agrees-to-expedited-health-care-appeal.php">agreed to expedite its review</a> [JURIST report] of a case challenging the PPACA but did not decide whether it will hear the case <em>en banc</em>. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-challenges-health-care-ruling.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the Fourth Circuit last month urging the court to overturn the district court decision striking down the individual mandate, arguing that the Constitution's Commerce Clause and taxing power gave Congress the ability to pass the mandate. Cuccinelli <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-to-ask-supreme-court-for-immediate-review-of-health-care-case.php">announced his intention to appeal directly to the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] earlier in February, citing the exceptionally far-reaching policy implications of the PPACA. There are currently 28 cases challenging the constitutionality of the PPACA. Federal courts in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">Washington, DC</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">Michigan</a> have upheld the law, while a federal court in <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] has also ruled the the individual mandate in unconstitutional, striking down the law in its entirety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement of the martial law style system was made in state-run media and gives the military commander "authority to take measures and procedures necessary for maintaining the integrity of the homeland." More than 10,000 protesters <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/middleeast/16bahrain.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">stormed the Saudi Arabian embassy</a> [NYT report] in Manama, the nation's capital, denouncing the monarchy. Foreign troops from Saudi Arabia and other surrounding nations have also moved into the country as a sign of the growing social and political tension in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Iran issued a statement saying the influx of foreign troops is unacceptable, but Bahrain's government has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5isbQXBlJJib45HQR3vTBa_8pV9qQ?docId=f11ac0ef8df54fa09e22d3eefe0aa838">defended the move </a> [AP report] as shield force reflecting a common regional destiny. 

<p>The state of emergency comes just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, called Sunday on the King to impose martial law under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Last week, the member states of the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], which includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786">deployed troops to Bahrain</a> [BBC report] for the purpose of guarding oil installations and financial institutions. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">called for an end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region. Ban said that he is "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, the court announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/california-supreme-court-agrees-to-rule-on-prop-8-standing-issue.php">decide the critical procedural issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine if the pending federal appeal of the invalidation of Proposition 8 can continue. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in January <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the California Supreme Court to weigh in before proceeding with the appeal of the August <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">ruling </a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. The uncertainty surrounding the proponents' standing is enhanced by the California Constitution's silence on the issue. In their argument for standing, the proponents emphasize the amount of work they have done to enact, support and defend the proposition up until this point, contending that this creates a "personal, particularized interest in the validity of their initiative entitling them to defend the initiative as real parties in interest if it is challenged in court." Moreover, they argue their entitlement is also derived from state law:<blockquote>It is well settled under California law that official proponents, unlike mere political, ideological, or philosophical supporters of initiatives, may intervene to defend the initiatives they have sponsored if they are challenged in court. Indeed, this Court's precedent and established principles of California constitutional law make clear that allowing official proponents to intervene to vindicate the People's interest in successful initiatives when public officials will not do so is necessary to preserve the People's initiative power, a power that must be jealously defended by the courts.</blockquote>California state officials have consistently declined to defend the initiative, and, in September, a California appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-appeals-court-refuses-to-order-state-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that they are not required to do so. If the California Supreme Court rules that state law does not allow the proponents take up the defense, the court of appeals will likely dismiss the case.

<p>Earlier this month, California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit lift the stay order prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending. Harris argued that the appeal is unlikely to succeed in light of the aforementioned jurisdictional concerns and the recent US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">decision to stop defending the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of portions of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] on the grounds that laws concerning sexual orientation should be subject to a higher standard of review. Harris also questioned the rationality of continuing to enforce the stay, noting that the measure's supporters would not be subjected to harm if the order was lifted, whereas same-sex couples seeking to marry may face violations of their constitutional rights so long as the stay remains effective. A three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">issued the stay</a> [JURIST report] last August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice spokesperson Haidar al-Saad said this decision was made after last month's <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilg-7XbWxuwSLpMN7ozIsDiUw-jA?docId=3ef799b0d39f40f985addc44bdc19367">investigation</a> [AP report] into the prison's living conditions. The prison population in the detention facility known as "Camp Honor" will be transferred to various other Iraqi prisons. Recently, human rights groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites], have responded to reports of detainee torture in Iraq, pressing for the Iraqi government to close detention centers that commit human rights abuses. 

<p>Last month, AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE14/001/2011/en/48c3c6e6-9607-4926-abd7-d1da1c51a976/mde140012011en.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/iraq-government-torturing-detainees-in-secret-prisons-amnesty.php">Iraqi government is operating secret prisons</a> [JURIST report], and suspects held in Iraqi custody have been systematically tortured since before the 2003 US invasion.

HRW learned from the Uzbekistan <a href="http://www.supcourt.uz/ru/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on March 10 that, after maintaining a presence in the country for 15 years, it would have to vacate its offices in Tashkent. In a prior correspondence, the Uzbek <a href="http://www.minjust.uz/">Justice Ministry</a> [official website] claimed that HRW ignored Uzbek legislation and lacked experience in the region. Uzbek authorities have provided no additional grounds for the order to vacate. According to HRW, the Uzbek government has obstructed its attempts to work in the country by denying or delaying visas and accreditation to HRW representatives and threatening criminal charges against one staff member. Several human rights activists and independent journalists are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/uzbekistan/8383370/Uzbek-government-kicks-out-Human-Rights-Watch.html">currently being detained in Uzbek prisons</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], which have been criticized for allegedly subjecting prisoners to torture and dismal conditions. The executive director of HRW, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/bios/kenneth-roth">Kenneth Roth</a> [HRW profile], criticized the Uzbek government for its decision:<blockquote>With the expulsion of Human Rights Watch, the Uzbek government sends a clear message that it isn't willing to tolerate critical scrutiny of its human rights record. ... The Uzbek government's persistent refusal to allow independent rights groups to carry out our work exacerbates the already dire human rights situation in the country, allowing severe abuses to go unreported, and further isolating the country's courageous and beleaguered human rights community.</blockquote>This is the first time HRW has been forced out of a country in the group's 33-year history.

<p>Uzbekistan has been criticized regularly for its poor human rights record. In April, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] gave a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4471">speech</a> [text], calling on Uzbekistan to deliver on promises as a signatory to various international treaties banning torture and civil rights violations in order to improve its human rights record. The rapidly growing Central Asian nation has long faced accusations from the West of rampant political oppression and a litany of human rights abuses, including the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2007/11/05/nowhere-turn-0">use of torture on its prisoners</a> [HRW report]. The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] in March <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-committee-urges-uzbekistan-to.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that Uzbekistan conduct an independent investigation of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4550845.stm">May 2005 clashes</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Andijan">news archive</a>] between protesters, soldiers and police in the city of Andijan that rights groups estimate left <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/rights-group-accuses-uzbek-government.php">as many as 500 people dead</a> [JURIST report].

The report was the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26208106">first to be issued</a> [Reuters report] on Uzbekistan by the Committee since the Andijan clashes, which were sparked when <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/uzbekistan-trial-of-muslim-businessmen.php">thousands of protesters gathered</a> [JURIST report] after rebels stormed a prison and freed a group of businessmen on trial for alleged Islamic extremism.

The report indicated that the human rights situation was deteriorating rapidly in the wake of the refusal by incumbent president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> to leave office after his defeat by challenger <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profiles] in November:<blockquote>With the political stalemate now going into its third month, the human rights situation in Cote d'Ivoire is becoming more precarious. Almost 300 people have been confirmed killed since the beginning of the crisis, and there are continuing reports of abductions, illegal detention and attacks against civilians. More than 35,000 people have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere, including in neighbouring countries. There are reports of thousands of youths being forcibly recruited and armed, presumably in preparation for violent conflict. The propagation of hatred and violence through the media remains a serious concern.</blockquote>The report details information surrounding allegations of attacks on political opponents and unarmed civilians as well as sexual violence.  Although the report includes events up until January 31, the OHCHR also presented recent developments, including ongoing attacks on political demonstrators, lack of basic services such as electricity and water, and rampant political propaganda. 

<p>In January, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-sg-rejects-calls-for-ivory-coast-recount.php">rejected the proposed recount</a> [JURIST report] of November's Ivory Coast presidential runoff election results as a "grave injustice and unfortunate precedent." Also in January, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-fears-genocide-possible-in-cote-divoire.php">UN officials expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] on continued post-election violence in the Ivory Coast, cautioning that genocide could be imminent.  In December, UN officials urged all parties to the disputed presidential election in the Ivory Coast to honor the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-urges-parties-to-prevent-ethnic-crimes-in-post-election-ivory-coast.php">commitment to prevent genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing under the <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement">2005 World Summit Outcome Document</a> [text, PDF]. Also in December, the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] urged Gbagbo to step down, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ECOWAS threatens forced removal of Ivory Coast president.php">threatening the use of force</a> [JURIST report] if he attempts to maintain power. Gbagbo has refused to cede power to president-elect Ouattara, who won the November 28 runoff election according to international observers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The international concern increased after the Turkish government arrested nine journalists earlier this month based on accusations that the journalists were members of the political dissent group <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] and had conspired to overthrow the government. The OHCHR spokesperson called for transparency in the arrests:<blockquote>If there are genuine reasons to suppose that any journalists have committed crimes outside the scope of their journalistic work, then those reasons should be transparent to the journalists themselves, to their defence lawyers and to the rest of us.</blockquote>Otherwise, the spokesperson said, the arrests appear to be "politically motivated" and are in violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR). Thousands of activists gathered in Istanbul on Sunday, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hzrd0GTqqzQiNxlL1NynSEmz9ndg?docId=CNG.312cded9f3e7fcc5a6ef17134a327358.6f1">protesting the arrests</a> [AFP report] and calling for more protection of freedom of speech.

<p>Turkey continues to face controversy regarding media freedom. In November, a Turkish Magistrate Court in Ankara <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/turkish-court-reinstates-ban-on-youtube.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] the nearly three-year ban on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [media website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] only days after the ban had been lifted. The court ordered access to YouTube blocked after video of former opposition leader Deniz Baykal in a bedroom with a female aide surfaced on the site. In September, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/europe-rights-court-rules-turkey-failed-to-protect-murdered-journalist-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey failed to protect the life of well-known Turkish-Armenian writer and journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>] and failed to adequately investigate his murder and infringed on his right of freedom of expression. Dink, editor of the newspaper <a href="http://www.agos.com.tr/eng/">Agos</a> [media website], was shot and <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/turkish-armenian-author-accused-of.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in Istanbul in January 2007. Prior to his death, Dink was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/turkish-editor-gets-six-month-jail.php">tried</a> and then put on <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/journalist-faces-retrial-for-insulting.php">retrial</a> [JURIST report] for "insulting Turkishness" by writing about the killing of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Souhair Khatib argued that being forced to remove her hijab was a violation of her religious rights under the <a href = "http://www.rluipa.com/index.php/article/398.html">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [text], which prohibits governments from imposing regulations upon inmates that engender religious discrimination. The <a href = "http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/cacd/Welcome.nsf/53B1893098D1B1C8882563FB008204C7/77848DABEEE7D893882564480073ADF5?OpenDocument">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] initially <a href = "http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/ecc65f191f28f59b8825728f005ddf4e/43e890eec077ce988825741800714185/$FILE/SACV07-1012DOC.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a holding cell is not a "prison, jail or pretrial detention facility" for protection under the law. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <A HREF = "/paperchase/2010/05/ninth-circuit-rules-removing-headscarf.php">upheld the ruling</a> [JURIST report] in a 2-1 decision, but Chief Judge Alex Kozinski filed a <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/13/0856423ebo.pdf">brief order</a> [text, PDF] stating he would take the matter to the full panel. The reinstatement opinion declared that this "improperly merge[d] two distinct inquiries: whether the facility is an 'institution,' and the government's burden as to accommodation."<blockquote>The County's argument reduces to the claim that because the application of RLUIPA to the courthouse holding facility is impractical and inconvenient the facility must not fall within the Act's definition of "institution." But this approach conflates RLUIPA's coverage and accommodation prongs. Congress certainly had real-world consequences in mind when it enacted RLUIPA, and the text of the statute indicates that it did not intend to minimize the serious security and other management interests of institutions. It chose, however, to deal with accommodation issues as a second step in the analysis, not by categorically excluding facilities like the Santa Ana Courthouse holding facility from RLUIPA.</blockquote>The court's decision was unanimous. However, they stated the opinion should not be read broadly, noting there are unique conditions to all detention facilities and courthouses, and this nature of violation should be decided case-by-case. <a href = "http://www.christinaabraham.com/">Christina Abraham</a> [personal website], Civil Rights Director, <a href = "http://www.cairchicago.org/">Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) - Illinois</a> [advocacy website], wrote on the case in <a href = "/hotline/2010/05/in-a-feat-of-apologetic.php">Ninth Circuit's Khatib decision undermines free exercise of religion</a> [JURIST op-ed].

<p>The <a href = "http://www.acluga.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</a> (ACLUGA) [advocacy website] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">lawsuit</a> in December on behalf of a Muslim woman who was arrested for refusing to remove her hijab in court, and ordered to serve <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">10 days in jail for contempt</a>[JURIST reports] in 2008.

The <a href = "http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/29/Scarf%20Suit.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in August by <a href = "http://www.cair.com/Home.aspx">CAIR</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of Raneen Albaghdady against Judge William Callahan of the Wayne County Circuit Court.

The stay bars enforcement, pending appeal, of a February 17 <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/media/file/Pdfs/dkt229.pdf">injunction</a> [order, PDF] by a judge from the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] giving BOEMRE 30 days to approve or deny applications filed by British drilling company <a href="http://www.enscoplc.com/">Ensco, Plc</a> [corporate website]. Judge Martin Feldman ruled in February that BOEMRE's delay of over four months in reviewing the permits was unreasonable.

The suit also names the state of California and <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/s_bio.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official profile] in alleging a violation of the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00002000--cc001-.html">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLIUPA) [42 USC &#167; 2000cc-1 text]. Basra, who is serving time for a drug offense, violated the prison's <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Regulations/Adult_Operations/docs/2011%20Title%2015%20English.pdf">grooming policy</a> [text, PDF] by maintaining a beard longer than one-half inch to abide by his <a href="http://www.sikhcoalition.org/SikhismQA.asp">Sikh beliefs</a> [Sikh Coalition backgrounder]. The prison's <a href="http://www.startribune.com/nation/118059704.html">disciplinary measures</a> [AP report] for the violation included performing extra prison duties, being confined to his bunk for 10 days and losing 30 days of credit for good behavior. The <a href="http://www.aclu-sc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/COMPLAINT_CV11-01676_SVW_FMOx.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] on behalf of Basra in February, alleging the state's prisons' regulations deprive Sikh inmates from practicing their <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] rights.  The ACLU's complaint also claims that when Basra filed for an exemption to the prison's grooming policy, the CDCR rejected his request, denying any charge of discrimination and saying:<blockquote>For clarification, you are not being discriminated against, as you allude to in your letter. ... You are being treated the same as the other inmates in [California Men's Colony]. You may have a beard, but you must keep it trimmed to no more than one-half inch in length. There is no provision in the [California Code of Regulations], Title 15 for the Warden to exempt the grooming standards.</blockquote>The DOJ's suit is part of an investigation into California's grooming policies that allegedly over-burden members of the Sikh faith who are required to wear kesh, or unshorn hair. 

<p>Members of the Sikh religion have also contested state prohibitions of ceremonial <a href="/currentawareness/religiousdress.php">religious dress</a> [JURIST news archives], including headscarves, turbans and daggers. In February 2010, a UK judge criticized Britain's <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-judge-criticizes-banning-of-sikh.php">ban on Sikhs wearing their ceremonial dagger</a> [JURIST report] in public places. In 2007, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/tsa-revises-turban-search-procedures.php">revised security procedures relating to headwear</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/sikh-rights-group-protests-new-us.php">Sikhs criticized</a> [JURIST reports] the potential for religious profiling. In 2006, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/canada-high-court-overturns-school.php">Supreme Court of Canada overturned</a> </a> [JURIST report] a Quebec school board's ban on carrying Sikh ceremonial daggers at school, ruling that it infringed students' religious freedom under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 2006, the French Conseil d'Etat <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/french-tribunal-rules-against-sikh.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that Sikhs have to remove their turbans to be photographed for driver's licenses as a matter of public security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report reveals that Roma communities are being denied access to housing, water and sanitation. Much of the Roma population is living in overcrowded shacks without access to adequate health care services, schools, shops and employment. According to the report, the Slovenian government is not taking action to prevent discrimination against the Roma or ensure remedies for victims. AI alleges that Slovenia is violating its obligations under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (ICERD), the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm">International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (ICESCR) and the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/163.htm">Revised European Social Charter</a> [texts]. AI contends that the Slovenian government has failed to provide basic human rights to the Roma, stating: <blockquote>Under international human rights law, Slovenia is obliged to address discrimination, to end segregation, to ensure at least a minimum security of tenure to all persons who lack it, to provide adequate housing for all persons without discrimination, to prioritise the most disadvantaged groups in housing policies and programmes, and to guarantee access to at least the minimum essential levels of water and sanitation for all persons. Slovenia has failed to comply with these obligations and confer security of tenure to people living in informal settlements and to provide access to water and sanitation to all persons, including those living in informal settlements.</blockquote> AI urges Slovenian authorities to address discrimination against Roma from private and public actors, implement programs to monitor discrimination, provide remedies for the victims and ensure that all Roma settlements have access to basic resources. 

<p>The Roma population has faced <a href="/hotline/2010/11/roma-students-face-lasting-repercussions-from-discrimination.php">discrimination</a> [JURIST comment] in various European countries. In November, a <a href="http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/fourth-communication-to-the-committee-of-ministers-on-judgment-implementation-30112010.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] filed with the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/cm/home_en.asp">Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe</a> [official website] by the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a>, the <a href="http://www.errc.org/">European Roma Rights Centre</a> and the <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/index.html">Greek Helsinki Monitor</a> [advocacy websites] alleged that the Czech Republic <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/human-rights-groups-file-complaint-with-eu-condemning-czech-republics-treatment-of-roma-children.php">continued to discriminate</a> [JURIST report] against Roma school children. The groups alleged that the Czech government failed to implement a November 2007 <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=825443&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">decision</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/echr-rules-against-separate-schooling.php">report</a>], which determined that the Czech Republic indirectly discriminated against Roma children. In October, the <a href="http://www.ldh-france.org/">League of Human Rights </a> (LDH) [advocacy website, in French] accused French authorities of <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-claims-france-police-illegally-collecting-roma-dna.php">improperly collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] from Roma migrants. French police may collect samples of genetic material from indicted individuals, though the organization contended that police have subjected the Roma to such procedures without being either arrested or charged. In September, AI urged EU members to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-group-urges-eu-nations-to-stop-forced-roma-deportation.php">stop forcibly deporting Roma migrants to Kosovo </a> [JURIST report]. AI believed that Roma, as well as other ethnic minority groups, could face persecution or violence upon their return. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontutah.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=4435">signed into law</a> [press release] a package of bills aimed at both reforming the state's immigration laws and challenging the federal government to take action for reform nationally. One of the four bills, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0497s01.htm">H.B. 497</a> [materials], is an enforcement law similar to the controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. The other bills are non-enforcement measures: <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0116s03.htm">H.B. 116</a> [materials] creates a guest worker program for illegal immigrants, allowing undocumented workers to live and work legally in the state, and the other two bills, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0466.htm">H.B. 466</a> and <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0469.htm">H.B. 469</a> [materials], create programs that allow companies to recruit Mexican workers, and American citizens to sponsor foreign residents who want to work or study in the US. The guest worker pilot program requires a federal waiver and will not go into effect until 2013, a strategy aimed at forcing the federal government to engage the issue at a national level. Governor Herbert praised the bills and lauded state officials for their efforts:<blockquote>There are those who will say these bills may not be perfect, but they are a step in the right direction and they are better than what we had. Thanks to the vision and determination of these local leaders, what we have begun today is a framework for a national conversation about immigration and a means to engage the federal government. Once again, Utah leads the nation in finding solutions and making tough choices.</blockquote>Governor Herbert also referred to the summit he convened last summer that laid the foundation for the legislation, calling the process "open, transparent, and civil." As he signed the immigration bills into law the governor offered an explicit challenge to the federal government to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issue and bring about national reform.

<p>Utah is one of several states that have developed legislation in the past year reflecting the controversial Arizona immigration law. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling. Additionally, in October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] motions to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the law's constitutionality, and in February Governor Brewer <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/arizona-governor-countersues-us-government-over-immigration-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_021011_CounterclaimSummary.pdf">counterclaim</a> [summary, PDF] against the US government in its lawsuit challenging the law. A three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-immigration-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the case in November, but have not yet reached a decision on the matter. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier in the day, the court formally <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistan-court-indicts-Raymond-Davis-for-double-murder/articleshow/7718500.cms">indicted</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] Davis on two counts of murder after the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/index.php">Lahore High Court</a> [official website] ruled Monday that, despite US <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-demands-release-of-diplomat-arrested-in-death-of-two-pakistanis.php">assertions</a> [JURIST report], he does <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Lahore-HC-dismisses-petitions-on-CIA-contractor-Raymond-Daviss-immunity/articleshow/7701806.cms">not qualify for diplomatic immunity</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report]. The charges were subsequently <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0AGBwECdPb--w0aPEA0KUum1d_Q?docId=CNG.e314ba0dc0a9061349e6fe1072be714a.c81">dismissed</a> [AFP report] once a USD $2.35 million "blood money" settlement was reportedly reached with the victims' families, an arrangement that prompted some Pakistanis to suspect coercive influence by US officials. Davis maintains that he acted in self-defense after being confronted by two armed men on motorcycles, who were believed to have robbed a Pakistani citizen at gunpoint minutes earlier.

<p>The dispute over Davis has strained what are already shaky diplomatic relations between the US and Pakistan. Those relations have been plagued by a variety of factors, including deaths related to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/05/AR2010100502784.html">airstrikes within Pakistan</a> [WP report].  Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/pakistan-files-complaint-protesting-nato-air-strikes.php">filed a complaint with NATO</a> [JURIST report] in October as a result of those airstrikes. Despite the fractured relationship, Pakistan remains one of the key US allies in the Middle East. In September of last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/pakistan-police-arrest-3-in-connection-with-times-square-bomb-plot.php">arrested three individuals</a> [JURIST report] linked with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=shahzad">Faisal Shahzad</a> [JURIST news archive], the man accused of attempting to detonate a bomb in Times Square.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing followed reports released in December by the US <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/node/12471">Department of Commerce</a> and the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [reports, PDF] petitioning for stronger online privacy protections, while maintaining the innovation of the Internet. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/about/bio_strickling.html">Lawrence Strickling</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2011/03/16/protecting-consumers-promoting-innovation-online-call-baseline-privacy-legislation">described</a> [Commerce blog] how legislation would "establish a clearer set of rules for the road for businesses and consumers, while preserving the innovation and free flow of information that are hallmarks of the Internet." FTC Chairman <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/commissioners/leibowitz/index.shtml">Jon Leibowitz</a> [official profile] explained how legislation might help to further the agency's efforts at establishing a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/03/privacy.shtm">"Do Not Track" system</a> [press release], describing how consumers could opt out of sharing their private information just once for all Internet based companies. Commerce Committee Chairman <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Chairman">Jay Rockefeller</a> (D-WV) [official profile] <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=10029257-d97e-4bad-a514-5faf90aeeed3&ContentType_id=77eb43da-aa94-497d-a73f-5c951ff72372&Group_id=4b968841-f3e8-49da-a529-7b18e32fd69d">expressed</a> [press release] the importance of Congress stepping up to protect consumer information:<blockquote>I appreciate that we live in a world in which online technology is rapidly evolving. I know some online companies have taken steps to address consumer privacy. And, I appreciate the need to proceed carefully when providing consumer protections that may disrupt the functionality of the Internet. But Congress can no longer sit on the sidelines. There is an online privacy war going on, and without help, consumers will lose. We must act to give Americans the basic online privacy protections they deserve.</blockquote>Last year, US Representatives Rick Boucher (D-VA) and <a href="http://stearns.house.gov/default.aspx">Cliff Stearns</a> (R-FL) [official website] proposed <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawmakers-introduce-internet-privacy-draft-legislation.php">draft legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at protecting Internet privacy and regulating how websites track information about visitors and then use that information to target advertising. The bill would have required websites to inform visitors how their information will be collected and used and to allow consumers to opt out. Representative <a href="http://speier.house.gov/">Jackie Speier</a> (D-CA) [official website] <a href="http://speier.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=48&parentid=46&sectiontree=46,48&itemid=683">introduced</a> [press release] similar <a href="http://speier.house.gov/uploads/Do%20Not%20Track%20Me%20Online%20Act.pdf">legislation</a> [HR 654 text] last month. Senator <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/">John Kerry</a> (D-MA) [official website] also plans on introducing a <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/press/release/?id=d18a9191-7fa3-437c-af24-3b6ca3a28f10">commercial privacy bill of rights</a> [press release].

<p>Support for legislation to protect online consumer rights comes amid mounting controversy surrounding Internet privacy issues. In November, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] confirmed that it is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fcc-investigating-google-for-street-view-privacy-breach.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Internet search company <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] to determine if it violated communications laws when its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=street+view">Street View</a> [JURIST news archive] vehicles inadvertently collected private user data, including passwords and URLs, over WiFi networks. At the time, members of Congress indicated that the incident could factor into new Internet privacy legislation. Also in November, the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/eu-calls-for-stronger-internet-privacy-laws.php">recommended stronger Internet privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] after a reviewing its 15 year-old privacy laws. Earlier that week, Google reached a <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/sa.pdf">settlement</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-announces-settlement-in-buzz-privacy-class-action-lawsuit.php">report</a>] in a class action lawsuit regarding privacy breaches relating to its Google Buzz social networking program. Under the settlement, Google will place $8.5 million dollars into a common fund to distribute to organizations that provide education regarding Internet privacy. In addition to investigations within the FCC and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">FTC</a>, Google has also recently come under investigation for privacy breaches relating to its Street View program in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">UK</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">Canada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">South Korea</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among those <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/middleeast/18bahrain.html">arrested</a> [NYT report] are dissident Hassan Mushaima and secular party leader Ebrahim Sharif. Six people were killed during the clashes on Wednesday and at least <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201131733318735470.html">1,000 people were injured</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Protesters injured in the melee have been denied medical care, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12769168">healthcare practitioners were beat</a> [BBC report] for trying to help the injured. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">statement</a> [text] on Thursday in which she said:<blockquote>My office has been receiving desperate calls and emails from numerous individuals in Bahrain, terrified about the armed forces' intentions. There are reports of arbitrary arrests, killings, beatings of protesters and of medical personnel, and of the takeover of hospitals and medical centers by various security forces. These reportedly include Bahraini police, defense forces and troops from the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force. This is shocking and illegal conduct. Police and armed forces must immediately leave healthcare facilities and cease their harassment and intimidation of health professionals.</blockquote>Pillay called on the government to stop using force against protesters and to facilitate medical treatment for the injured.

<p>On Tuesday, Bahraini King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a three-month <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency comes just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, called Sunday on the King to impose martial law under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Last week, the member states of the GCC, which includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786">deployed troops to Bahrain</a> [BBC report] for the purpose of guarding oil installations and financial institutions. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">called for an end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region. Ban said that he is "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ozanne alleges the February 25 special session that enacted the Budget Repair Bill, or <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Senate Bill 11</a> [text, PDF], which strips public unions of the vast majority of their collective bargaining rights, was conducted in violation of <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law</a> [Wis. Stat. &#167; 19.81-19.98]. The law represents the codification of two provisions of the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/wisconst.pdf">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which require that "[t]he right of the people to peacably assemble, to consult for the common good, and to petition the government, or any department thereof, shall never be abridged," [Article I &#167; 4] and that "[t]he doors of each house shall be kept open except when the public welfare shall require secrecy." [Article IV, &#167; 10].  The complaint also alleges that the meeting was held in violation of <a href="http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll/Session%20Related/rules/1/4?f=templates$fn=document-frameset.htm$q=[field%20folio-destination-name:'jr3']$x=Advanced#0-0-0-59">Joint Rule 3 of the Wisconsin Legislature</a> [text], which sets minimum procedural standards for calling a roll call vote. According to the complaint:<blockquote>No Joint Rule of the Wisconsin Legislature establishes a different procedure for providing public notice and public access to the meeting of the Joint Committee of Conference on January 2011 Special Assembly Bill 11 than is required by Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law.... The public notice for said meeting was insufficient as to reasonably likely apprise the public and the news media that the Joint Committee of Conference would consider, discuss, debate and act on a new version of of [the] Bill ... which had not been previously passed by the Senate[.]</blockquote>Ozanne has asked the court to invalidate the law and forbid the secretary of state from publishing it. He also asks for a fine of $300 on each of the Republican legislators involved in the passage of the bill. 

<p>Oznne is the second public official to mount a legal challenge to the bill, following a suit filed by Dane <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> (D) [official biography] <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/117811503.html">filed a similar suit last week</a> [MWJS report; <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">complaint</a>, PDF]. Falk's suit came immediately after Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed the bill into law last week</a> [JURIST report]. The provisions limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since February 15, when SB 11 was introduced to address the state's $3.6 billion deficit. Earlier this month, a Wisconsin judge ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-orders-capitol-building-open-to-public.php">state capitol building must remain open</a> [JURIST report] to the public during business hours, despite an attempt to close the building to protesters who had occupied it as part of a protest against the proposed restrictions on collective bargaining. The <a href="http://www.wseu-24.org/">Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24</a> (WSUE) [advocacy website] filed the petition earlier in the day in reaction to Walker ordering the capitol building closed and removing protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision <a href="http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/496425,dekrety_wojenne_bezprawne_ilu_skazanych_zazada_wznowienia_postepowania.html">facilitates the restitution process</a> [<em>Dziennik Gazeta</em> report, in Polish] for those harmed while martial law remained in effect by eliminating the need for courts to rule on the declaration's constitutionality on a case-by-case basis. Thousands of restitution claims are expected from victims or their families, including those killed, imprisoned, terminated from their employment or otherwise harmed during the period.

<p>The trial of former Polish leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jaruzelski">General Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> [JURIST news archive], charged with "organizing crimes of a military nature," deprivation of freedom through internment, and other offenses in connection with the martial law declaration, <a href="http://www.thenews.pl/national/artykul151372_martial-law-illegal--tribunal-rules.html">resumed</a> [Polskie Radio report] last month after originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-ex-leaders-go-on-trial-for.php">commencing</a> [JURIST report] in 2008. Jaruzelski was previously tried for ordering troops to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1331686.stm">fire on striking ship workers</a> [BBC report] in the 1970s, but that trial ended without a verdict.

About 100 people are said to have died as a result of the martial law declaration and the subsequent arrests of Solidarity leaders, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/963417.stm">Lech Walesa</a> [BBC profile], and some 10,000 people were held in internment camps.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The<a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/"> Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] in October <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/ontario-high-court-allows-witnesses-to-wear-niqab-unless-unfair-to-accused.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a witness does not have to remove her veil unless the failure to do so will prevent the accused from receiving a fair trial, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The case was then remanded to the lower court. The trial began in 2007 after the woman told police that her uncle and cousin had repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was between the ages of six and ten years old. The trial court required the victim to remove her veil when testifying against her uncle and cousin. The defendants argue that allowing the woman to wear a niqab on the stand obstructs their right to face their accuser. David Butt, the woman's lawyer, responded that an exception should be granted to ensure that victims of sexual assault, specifically Muslim women who practice religious veiling, <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/canadian_court_ponders_whether_woman_must_remove_niqab_to_testify_at_sex_as/">feel welcomed by the judicial system</a> [CBC Canada News, report].

<p>The wearing of traditional religious clothing in court rooms and other public places has been highly contested in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">United States</a> [JURIST report] and around the world. In October, the <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/homepage.14.html">French Constitutional Council</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">bill</a> [materials, in French] making it illegal to wear the Islamic <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive], niqab or other full face veils in public, conforms with the Constitution. Earlier that month, a Dutch politician suggested that the Netherlands will <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition.

Companion bills were introduced in both chambers of Congress in an effort to capitalize on growing public support for same-sex marriage. Representatives <a href="http://nadler.house.gov/">Jerry Nadler</a> (D-NY), <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) and over 100 cosponsors are leading the effort in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House</a>, and Senators <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT), <a href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/">Dianne Feinstein</a> (D-CA), <a href="http://gillibrand.senate.gov/">Kirsten Gillibrand</a> (D-NY) and about twenty cosponsors are promoting the bill in the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official sites]. Five states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriages. Currently DOMA allows other states to ignore those recognized same-sex marriages, and prevents same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits available to married couples. The proposed legislation would repeal DOMA and formally amend United States Code definition of marriage:<blockquote>For the purposes of any Federal law in which marital status is a factor, an individual shall be considered married if that individual's marriage is valid in the State where the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside any State, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered into and the marriage could have been entered into in a State.</blockquote>Rep. Nadler first introduced the repeal legislation, cited as the Respect for Marriage Act, in the House in 2009, but the measure did not receive a vote in committee or on the floor. This is the first time such legislation has been brought in the Senate.

<p>The Congressional action follows February's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA, which restricts the federal definition of marriage to heterosexual couples, in court cases challenging the provision. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php"> ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Earlier this month House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he is launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution."</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is suspected of involvement with the <a href="http://www.blythe.org/peru-pcp/">Shining Path</a> [backgrounder], a Maoist guerilla organization, believed to be responsible for the deaths of thousands in conflicts in Peru. The man, whose name has yet to be released, was <a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/main-section/exclusive_death_squads_suspect_held_under_new_uk_legislation_1_3182000">arrested</a> [<em>Yorkshire Post</em> report] on Tuesday and is being held while police conduct searches of several addresses in the area linked to him. The man is the first to be arrested under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/coroners-justice-bill.htm">Coroners and Justice Act 2009</a> [materials], which allows UK courts to hear cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by nonresidents between 1991 and 2001.

The proposed bill delegates police officers the authority to question the citizenship status of any person lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and arrest them without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally. The bill also authorizes police officers to seize any property, including vehicles and personal property, used to harbor or transport illegal immigrants into the US. Some Senate members had disagreed over the controversial bill, fearing it would be <a href="http://www.koco.com/r/27215968/detail.html">deemed unconstitutional</a> [KOCO report]. Senator <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/Senators/biographies/shortey_bio.aspx">Ralph Shortey</a> (R) [official profile] praised the approval:<blockquote>Today's vote sends a message to the people of Oklahoma that we have listened to their concerns and acted accordingly. I authored this proposal because I care about the people of my district and have witnessed firsthand the manner in which illegal immigration can limit economic development, increase crime rates and tear families apart. Passage of this legislation is a strong step toward addressing the issue and a victory for Oklahoma.</blockquote>The bill will now move to the <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma House</a> [official website] for a vote. 

<p>Oklahoma is one of several states that have developed legislation in the past year reflecting the controversial Arizona immigration law. This week, Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=4435">signed into law</a> [press release] a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">package of bills</a> [JURIST report] aimed at both reforming the state's immigration laws and challenging the federal government to take action for reform nationally. One of the four bills, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0497s01.htm">H.B. 497</a> [materials], is an enforcement law similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law, and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At a hearing before the House <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/home">Armed Services Committee</a> [official website], General Counsel <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=173">Jeh Johnson</a> [official profile] called for Congress to explore all trial possibilities for the detainees, including both military panels and civilian trials permitted under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article 3</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Johnson's comments followed the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/defense-drumbeat-blog?ContentRecord_id=8a8b74a3-cce6-47e9-aa13-270c552554cb">introduction of extensive detainee legislation</a> [ASC news release] last week that could prevent further civilian trials for Guantanamo prisoners. Armed Services Chairman <a href="http://mckeon.house.gov/">Buck McKeon</a> (R-CA) [official website] introduced the proposed <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=0f07340d-49c0-4732-a9f9-2c022f178a93">Detainee Security Act of 2011</a> [text, PDF], which would not allow detainees who are under review for continued detention to have a lawyer, would permit ongoing detention without trial and would prohibit detainees from being transferred or tried within the US. 

<p>Last week, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/executive-order-periodic-review-individuals-detained-guant-namo-bay-nava">executive order</a> [text; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/fact-sheet-new-actions-guant-namo-and-detainee-policy">fact sheet</a>] allowing <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] for Guantanamo detainees to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-orders-resumption-of-guantanamo-military-trials.php">resume</a> [JURIST report]. New charges in the military commission system had been suspended since shortly after Obama took office in 2009. The order also established a procedure for establishing a review process for detainees who have not been charged, convicted or designated for transfer. Last month, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to highlight what it claims are <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">problems with the detention system</a> [JURIST report] currently used by the US for dealing with suspected terrorists. The detainee, Awal Gul, who had been at the Guantanamo Bay detention center since October 2002 and was suspected of <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/634323321561093750.pdf">having aided the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</a> [DOD press release, PDF], died of an apparent heart attack after he had completed some aerobic exercises.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The states had originally requested <em>en banc</em> review, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/faster-health-care-appeal-asked/">along with an altered briefing schedule</a> [SCOTUSblog report], on March 10. In its brief, the government asserted that initial <em>en banc</em> review is reserved for "extraordinary cases", where "panel review would be futile in the face of binding circuit precedent," and no such precedent exists in this area. The government also pointed to the fact that the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Seven-Sky-en-banc-denial-3-17-11.pdf">denied a petition</a> [order, PDF] for an initial <em>en banc</em> hearing of an appeal on the health care law. The briefing schedule was also a target of the government's brief, as Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys stated:<blockquote>Nor is it apparent that the briefing schedule would provide adequate time for the Court to review the district court's opinions and the briefs submitted by the parties and their amici. Under the Court's order, briefing will conclude on May 25, which would give the full Court only two weeks before the June 6 en banc sitting to consider an appeal that, in plaintiffs' view, "is unprecedented in its scope, scale, and importance."</blockquote>While the brief detailed the reasons why initial <em>en banc</em> review is unwarranted, in concluded by stating that the government is prepared to proceed no matter the court's decision.

<p>Last week, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/11th-circuit-agrees-to-expedited-health-care-appeal.php">Eleventh Circuit granted</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration's motion for an expedited appeal, but it had not addressed the states' motion for the appeal to be heard <em>en banc</em>. Last month, Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli filed a petition for a <em><a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">writ of certiorari</a></em> [JURIST report] with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+supreme+court">US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rules on the issue, but the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-expedited-health-care-review.php">opposes the petition</a> [JURIST report]. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 9 is a right to freedom of religion, while Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees the right to an education in conformity with personal religious convictions. The parties challenging the display of the crucifix had argued that the religious objects interfered with the right to freedom of thought and that the crucifixes indicated that the government had a preference for a particular religion. The Italian government had argued that the presence of crucifixes was justified based upon tradition and that "beyond its religious meaning, the crucifix symbolized the principles and values which formed the foundation of democracy and western civilization." The court emphasized that member states have a "responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs" in order to maintain religious tolerance and public order. The court ultimately ruled, however, that there was no evidence that the presence of crucifixes would negatively impact school children, and that the lack of evidence meant that no reasonable conclusions could be drawn as to the effect of the crucifixes on children whose convictions are still developing. If the ECHR found that the presence of the crucifix in public classrooms violated the Convention on Human Rights, the ruling would have applied to all 27 EU member states.

<p>The court's ruling overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/europe-rights-court-rules-crucifixes-in.php">previous decision</a> [JURIST report] in <em>Lautsi v. Italy</em>, which ordered the Italian government to remove crucifixes from state-run schools. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi responded to the initial ban by stating that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-will-not-remove-crucifix-from.php">Italy was not bound</a> [JURIST report] by the ECHR's decision and that he <a href="http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_novembre_06/berlusocni_crocifisso_9674b4aa-cacc-11de-89f9-00144f02aabc.shtml?fr=box_primopiano">found the decision to be disrespectful</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian]. Berlusconi also indicated at that time that, even if the government's appeal of the decision failed, the crucifixes would not be removed.

Last week, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/arab-league-calls-for-un-no-fly-zone-over-libya.php">UN was called upon to impose a no-fly zone</a> [JURIST report] over Libya in response to reports that Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] had been using aircraft attacks to combat civilian protesting. Prior to Thursday's UN vote authorizing the resolution, Gaddafi threatened an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/africa/18libya.html">imminent attack on Benghazi</a> [NYT report]. Moreno-Ocampo's warning follows an issuance of an ultimatum by Libyan government officials that all Benghazi citizens must leave the targeted areas which Libya plans to attack. According to Moreno-Ocampo, "the issuance of such a warning does not provide an excuse to attack civilians. ... The government can control rebellion but cannot attack civilians." Following Moreno-Ocampo's statement, the Libyan government declared a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110318/ap_on_re_af/af_libya">ceasefire to halt international intervention</a> [AP report]. However, according to reports, attacks have reportedly not stopped, and Moreno-Ocampo maintains that there will be no impunity for attacks on civilians.

<p>Earlier this month, the ICC launched a probe to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">investigate allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government. Moreno-Ocampo specifically identified Gaddafi, his sons and his political allies as targets of the investigation and warned Libyan officials that complicity in such abuses would result in prosecution.  Additionally, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">appointed a team of special prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations that Gaddafi ordered forces to torture and abduct opponents. Gaddafi is accused of ordering hospital patients' executions, firing on crowds of protesters and using other extreme tactics against his opponents. The UN General Assembly has voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya </a>[JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi.

The IACH investigated six immigrant detention centers based throughout Arizona and Texas. The report expresses concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by the US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE). It criticizes the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. IACH also found the average 30 day detentions troubling, arguing that it is likely to increase as backlogs of immigration cases increase. The report also criticizes the lack of a genuine civil detention system and use of disproportionately restrictive penal and punitive measures during the detention. IACH also disapproved of contractors handling the management and personal care of immigration detainees and the lack of oversight from the ICE over the private contractors. The lack of representation for the immigrant detainees was particularly troubling for the IACH:<blockquote>The IACHR observes the significant disparity in access to legal representation for detained immigrants. According to government statistics, in FY2008 approximately 40% of non-detained immigrants were represented in their immigration proceedings, whereas just 16% of detained immigrants were represented by counsel. The lack of legal counsel, the Inter-American Commission observes, has a profound impact on the chances of relief. The Constitution Project reports that just 3% of detained, unrepresented asylum seekers were granted relief.</blockquote>IACHR identified the lack of access to pro-bono representation in the rural immigration detention locations, lack of interest from private attorneys and difficulty in gathering evidence needed for legal proceedings as factors that contributed to the lack of legal representation for immigrant detainees. The report advocates the reduction of the use of expedited removal, earlier access to counsel and prohibitions against moving detainees to where it would be easier obtain orders of removal. 

<p>Absent comprehensive reform at the federal level, illegal immigration continues to be a concern for local governments as well. On Wednesday, the Oklahoma State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law. Also this week, Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=4435">signed into law</a> [press release] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">a package of bills</a> [JURIST report] aimed at both reforming the state's immigration laws and challenging the federal government to take action for reform nationally. One of the four bills, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0497s01.htm">H.B. 497</a> [materials], is an enforcement law similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law, and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Maryann Sumi's order <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/us/19wisconsin.html">blocked the law from being published</a> [NYT report], one of the procedural steps towards enacting it. The <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/host.madison.com/content/tncms/assets/editorial/4/36/4de/4364de82-5010-11e0-8298-001cc4c002e0-revisions/4d8124a9545ca.pdf.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] over the bill alleges that Republican legislators did not follow the state's <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text], a rule requiring 24 hours notice&#8212;or two hours if there is an emergency&#8212;before a public meeting. <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">filed the complaint</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday in an attempt to invalidate the law, which strips public unions of the vast majority of their collective bargaining right. A full hearing of the suit will occur on March 29, but nothing in the restraining order blocks Republicans from passing the bill again with the appropriate notice.

<p>Ozanne is the second public official to mount a legal challenge to the bill, following a <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">similar suit filed last week</a> [complaint, PDF] by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> [official profile]. Falk's suit came immediately after Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed the bill into law last week</a> [JURIST report]. The provisions limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since February 15, when SB 11 was introduced to address the state's $3.6 billion deficit. Earlier this month, a Wisconsin judge ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-orders-capitol-building-open-to-public.php">state capitol building must remain open</a> [JURIST report] to the public during business hours, despite an attempt to close the building to protesters who had occupied it as part of a protest against the proposed restrictions on collective bargaining. The <a href="http://www.wseu-24.org/">Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24</a> [advocacy website] filed the petition earlier in the day in reaction to Walker ordering the capitol building closed and removing protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In December, UN officials urged all parties to the disputed presidential election in the Ivory Coast to honor the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-urges-parties-to-prevent-ethnic-crimes-in-post-election-ivory-coast.php">commitment to prevent genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing under the <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement">2005 World Summit Outcome Document</a> [text, PDF]. Also in December, the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] urged Gbagbo to step down, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ECOWAS%20threatens%20forced%20removal%20of%20Ivory%20Coast%20president.php">threatening the use of force</a> [JURIST report] if he attempts to maintain power. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Gbagbo</a> has refused to cede power to president-elect <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Ouattara</a> [BBC profiles], who won the November 28 runoff election according to international observers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state of emergency will last 30 days and gives security forces greater powers to maintain order and also includes a ban on citizens carrying arms in public. There is also a possibility that the state of emergency includes a curfew. The decree came after <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/idINIndia-55698420110318">25 protesters were killed</a> [Reuters report] on Friday at an anti-government rally in the country's capital of Sana'a. Police were present at the rally to ensure control, but Saleh stated at a <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/shownews.php?lng=ar&_nsid=9186">press conference</a> [statement, in Arabic] that the police did not use live rounds on the crowd and that the shootings were the result of confrontations between protesters and local residents. Saleh stated that a "committee of neutral bodies" will investigate the incident and called those killed during the protest "martyrs of democracy."

<p>Yemen is not the first country to declare a state of emergency in the midst of anti-government protests this week. On Sunday, Bahraini lawmakers called on King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and invoke martial law after 5,000 protesters marched to demand an end to the monarchy. Bahrain officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday. Yemeni authorities have previously been criticized for their counter-terror methods. In August, Amnesty International [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/yemen-counter-terror-methods-violate-human-rights-ai.php">criticized methods used by the government</a> [JURIST report] as violations of human rights.

The review provided the US with 228 recommendations in 10 different areas regarding human rights policies and practices. <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Hongju Koh</a> [academic profile], a representative of the US Department of State (DOS), accepted recommendations made regarding immigration rights and stated that the government was in the process of reviewing its handling of refugee cases. The US was commended for continuing to protect the environment and also for its initiatives in the fight against human trafficking. Members of the committee condemned the US for rejecting many of the recommendations without reason. Among others, the US rejected calls to ban racial discrimination and religious profiling, close the Guantanamo Bay facilities, and abolish the death penalty. Koh argued that capital punishment was not precluded by international law. He urged delegations to look at the bigger picture of the progress the US has made regarding human rights and justice instead of looking at individual recommendations. Koh called the Universal Periodic Review an "ongoing process."

<p>Koh echoed objections he made when the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-makes-recommendations-for-us-to-improve-human-rights-record.php">recommendations were first issued</a> [JURIST report] in November. In August, the DOS <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-releases-human-rights-review.php">released its own human rights review</a> [JURIST report] and presented the report to the UNHRC. In the report, the DOS acknowledged the US government's historical struggle with some human rights issues including gender and racial equality, but noted the progress made in both areas. The Obama administration received criticism from both human rights groups and US politicians for initially <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/02/116401.htm">not taking part</a> [press release] in the UPR sessions, a process which each of the 192 <a href="/hotline/2010/03/un-human-rights-councils-upr-process.php">UN member states must undergo every four years</a> [JURIST comment]. This marks the US government's first UPR evaluation before the UNHRC. The US was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-elected-to-seat-on-un-rights-council.php">elected to the UNHRC</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. The UNHRC was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-un-approves-human-rights.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, at which time the Bush administration declined to seek a Council seat or participate in its proceedings due to a perceived anti-Israeli sentiment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, which is slated to become effective at the end of August, bans abortions of "viable" fetuses. The legislation would provide some exceptions, permitting abortions of viable fetuses only when the woman's life is endangered by a physical illness or disability, or when continued pregnancy poses the risk of substantial physical impairment to the pregnant woman. The legislation further requires a concurring opinion from a second physician before the abortion of a viable fetus can be performed. Doctors who abort viable fetuses in violation of the late-term abortion law could face up to seven years in prison and fines between $10,000 and $50,000. <a href="http://www.missourilife.org/">Missouri Right to Life</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.missourilife.org/news/2011/031711.html">applauded the passage of the legislation</a> [press release]: <blockquote>While abortion at any stage of development is an offense against human dignity, certainly we can all agree that subjecting unborn children to the horrible pain of abortion is unacceptable in a civilized society. Unborn Children are the most vulnerable members of the human family and cannot speak for themselves. Our shared humanity compels us to protect the most vulnerable among us, and we are grateful to Rep. Jones and all the Democrats and Republicans who supported this legislation.</blockquote>The bill will now proceed to the Missouri <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] for debate and voting. 

<p>Several state legislatures have acted recently to place restrictions abortions. Last week, the Oklahoma House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. Last month, the Kansas House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved several new restrictions on abortion</a> [JURIST report]. If the bills are approved by the Senate, Kansas residents will not be able to obtain an abortion after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. Other restrictions include a stringent parental consent and notification system for a minor's abortion and "clear and convincing" evidence for a judicial bypass of parental consent; the ability to bring a civil suit against abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; the right for criminal prosecution of abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; and for abortion providers to inform patients that the fetus is a "whole, separate, unique, living human being."</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to a source from the high judicial committee overseeing the referendum, voter turnout reached 60 percent and <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE72J0FQ20110320">70 percent of voters approved constitutional reform</a> that would allow Egypt's military rulers to proceed with the new election process, with parliamentary elections taking place <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72J0FQ20110320">as early as September</a> [Reuters reports]. The majority approval is a <a href="/hotline/2011/03/whats-at-stake-in-egypts-referendum-gary-c-gambill-editor-mideast-monitor.php">milestone</a> [JURIST comment] for Egypt during its transition to a democratic society following the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">national uprising</a> [JURIST news archive] against former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. The referendum was a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12793484">stark contrast</a> [BBC report] from previous elections under Mubarak, where results where pre-determined and voter turnout was extremely low. Both the National Democratic Party and the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/breakingNews.php">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website] supported the amendments to Egypt's <a href="http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolcon.htm">constitution</a> [text], which include lowering the presidential term limit and mandating new criteria for potential presidential candidates. The referendum vote, however, was not without some controversy. Four human rights groups, including the <a href="http://newwf.org/">New World Foundation for Development and Human Rights</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_4-rights-groups-complain-irregularities-in-egypt-s-referendum_1522094">filed a complaint</a> [report] with the judiciary committee claiming irregularities during the referendum vote. Among the allegations are that voters were being influenced at the polls, no judges were present at several polling stations and that other stations had run out of ballots and were printing and using unofficial ballot papers. The official results of the referendum are expected to be announced on Sunday evening. 

<p>The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces last month announced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-appoints-judges-to-amend-constitution.php">formation of the judicial committee</a> [JURIST report] to oversee amending the Egyptian constitution. When the council assumed power, it indicated that part of its <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1102/S00429/egypt-constitutional-proclamation.htm">transition plan</a> [proclamation text] was to form a committee to amend constitutional articles prior to holding a public referendum. The plan followed the intentions of ousted president Mubarak, who had approved the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-vp-announces-political-agreements-and-committee-to-reform-constitution.php">formation of a panel</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution before he resigned. Mubarak stepped down after <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121161511674298.html">nearly three weeks of demonstrations</a> [Al Jazeera report] protesting the Egyptian government and calling for his resignation. Mubarak's resignation left state affairs in the hands of the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">lift the country's emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that were in place for nearly 30 years once circumstances in the country improved. The Council also vowed to have a peaceful transition to power and promised not to prosecute "honourable people who refused corruption and demanded for reform." Last month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in various countries across the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder] currently embroiled in protests. During the three weeks of protests leading up to Mubarak's resignation, nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI reports that India's <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,LEGISLATION,IND,,3ae6b52014,0.html">Public Safety Act</a> (PSA) [text] is being used to detain people despite the absence of sufficient evidence for a trial. Over the last decade, between 8,000 and 20,000 people have been detained through the PSA, including 322 between January and September 2010. The PSA only applies to Kashmir and Jammu, a state that has been rife with unrest since it became part of India in the middle of the 20th century. People detained under the PSA can be held for up to two years, but AI notes that the successive orders are often issued, resulted in detentions that exceed two years. In addition, AI claims that the detainees do not have effective legal recourse to challenge their detention and are sometimes subjected to ill-treatment and torture. AI's Asia-Pacific Director Sam Zarifi said: <blockquote>The use of administrative detention does not conform to international human rights legal obligations and agreements that the Indian government is a party to. The Indian government must ensure that Jammu and Kashmir authorities repeal the PSA and end the odious system of administration detention once and for all.</blockquote>AI is calling on India's government and the local government in Kashmir and Jammu to carry out an independent, impartial and comprehensive investigation into allegations of abuses against detainees and their families, including allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, denial of visits and medical care, making its findings public and holding those responsible to account.

<p>Kashmir and Jammu, which is officially part of India, has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5030514.stm">disputed</a> [BBC backgrounder] between Pakistan and India since 1947. Claims by both Pakistan and India to the territory have resulted in several conflicts in the region, particularly the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1947-1948 and 1965. In addition, there was a large show of military force by both nations in the region in 2002 that caused international alarm because both nations have nuclear weapons. India has sought to stifle unrest and a burgeoning separatist movement in the region by detaining human rights and political activists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-63.htm">Maples v. Allen</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/02-25-Maples-Petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will review a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/02-25-Maples-opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] the state of Alabama may execute Cory Maples without federal <em>habeas</em> review of his constitutional claims due to a missed appeal deadline that was no fault of the prisoner's. The Alabama trial court had dismissed Maples' petition for post-conviction relief and sent notice of this ruling to the prisoner's attorneys, but the notice was returned to the court unopened and stamped returned to sender because the attorneys had left that firm. The court did nothing with this, and the deadline to appeal the ruling passed. Maples was convicted of capital murder for killing two people after a night of drinking. He had argued his counsel was ineffective because it failed to present evidence of his intoxication and his drug history, which he believed would have mitigated his sentence. He also argued the trial court failed to give proper jury instructions by not including the lesser offense of manslaughter by voluntary intoxication under Alabama law.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-788.htm">Rehberg v. Paulk</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/03-18-Rehberg-petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine a circuit court split over whether government officials who act as "complaining witnesses" to initiate a prosecution by providing false testimony are are immune to civil suits. The petitioner Charles Rehberg is asking the court to clarify the application of two conflicting Supreme Court precedents in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15871548813309646312&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Briscoe v. Lahue</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12074975541007910866&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Malley v. Briggs</a> [opinions]. In Briscoe, the court held that a police officer who allegedly committed perjury was immune from civil liability. However, in Malley, the court allowed a suit against a police officer for wrongfully causing an arrest warrant to be issued, reasoning that the officer was acting as a "complaining witness." The circuit courts are split over which precedent to apply when a government official provides testimony as a complaining witness. Rehberg argues that Dougherty County District Attorney's office in Georgia falsely accused him of various crimes after he publicized unethical billing practices of a local hospital to which the district attorney allegedly had political connections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bloomberg LP</a> [docket], leaving in place a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/second-circuit-orders-federal-reserve.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] requiring the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] to release information regarding loans it made to various banks during April and May 2008, a key time in the financial crisis. While the Federal Reserve did not choose to appeal the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to the Supreme Court, it was appealed by the <a href="http://www.theclearinghouse.org/about/association/000223f.php">Clearing House Association</a> [association website], which consists of a group of banks. Following the court's decision, the Federal Reserve Board reported that it will <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/67846296/">release the emergency-lending data</a> [Bloomberg report, video]. According to the court's order, it has five days to do so. The data will include information about the specific banks that were in financial trouble and as a result, asked for assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Supreme Court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in a companion case brought by Fox News, requiring the Federal Reserve to disclose loan information from the period between August 2007 and November 2008.

<p>Bloomberg originally sued the Federal Reserve under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text, PDF], and both the court of appeals and the trial court rejected the latter's argument that the records sought fell within FOIA exceptions. Now the Federal Reserve has an even greater duty to release the information under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [text, PDF]. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 and created a new regulatory council, the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/FSOC-index.aspx">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [official website], to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent companies from becoming "too big to fail." The FSOC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-dept-of-treasurys-financial-stability-oversight-council-convenes-for-first-meeting.php">convened for the first time</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010. In addition to creating the FSOC, this legislation also gives the Federal Reserve new oversight over the largest financial institutions, creates a bureau of consumer protection, introduces multitudes of new regulations on derivatives and other financial instruments and limits the amount of capital banks can invest in hedge funds. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month, Blagojevich's lawyers submitted  a <a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2011/03/blagojevichs-motion-to-dismiss-plain-text-version.html">motion</a> [text] to cancel the ex-governor's retrial and sentence him only on the single charge on which he was originally convicted. Blagojevich was found <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. His attorneys, who had worked without pay, argued that a retrial was an economic hardship and an unnecessary drain on taxpayer funds. Beyond suggesting that the request was made primarily to arouse public attention, the judge clarified the motion was improperly presented and, therefore, could not be ruled upon. Blagojevich's defense team was granted additional time to file a proper motion, even though the court predicts the issue will dissipate with time. If convicted of making false statements to the FBI, Blagojevich faces a maximum five-year prison sentence. 

<p>Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] granted federal prosecutors' motion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dismiss three charges</a> [JURIST report] against Blagojevich in an apparent effort to simply their case before the April 20 retrial. In Blagojevich's first trial, the jury deliberated for 14 days after the 11-week trial but was unable to reach a consensus on all but one of the charges. In September, lawyers for Blagojevich asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-override-false-statements-conviction.php">throw out the sole conviction</a>, stating that the government failed to meet its required burden of proof, but the judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-refuses-to-throw-out-blagojevich-conviction.php">refused</a> [JURIST reports]. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate voted unanimously to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">remove him from office</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Van Hollen's office filed the motion seeking temporary relief from a <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/news/view.jsp?id=248">order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">report</a>] enjoining Wisconsin <a href="http://www.sos.state.wi.us/">Secretary of State Douglas La Follette</a> [official website] from publishing the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [SB 11 text, PDF], thus giving it the effect of law. He also asked for leave to appeal the order and for relief consisting of an order to stay the circuit court's ruling. Van Hollen argues that the Dane County Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because the four named defendants, who are all state legislators, enjoy legislative immunity during the regular legislative term. He also argued that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the publishing of the law:<blockquote>Contrary to established case law, the trial court injected itself into the legislative process and enjoined a legislative act. There is absolutely no authority for the broad, over reaching step taken. In the interests of the administration of justice, it is necessary&#8212;nay, it is imperative&#8212;that this Court step forward and undo this inappropriate act. ... It is only after the ministerial, non-discretionary act of publication&#8212;that is after the law is in force&#8212;that a trial court my visit the issue of constitutionality of the law.</blockquote>The next hearing in the case is scheduled to begin March 29.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], filed last week by Dane County <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> (D) [official website], alleges that Republican legislators did not follow the state's <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text], a rule requiring 24 hours notice&#8212;or two hours if there is an emergency&#8212;before a public meeting. Ozanne's suit was the second such challenge by a state official, following a <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">similar suit</a> [complaint] filed by Dane <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> (D) [official profile]. The provisions of the Budget Repair Bill limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since mid-February, when the bill was introduced. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law by <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> (R) [official website] on March 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-juvenile-miranda-rights.php">report</a>] on the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/exclusionary_rule">exclusionary rule</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The issue is whether the rule requires the suppression of evidence obtained from a search permitted by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1195174.html">United States v. Gonzalez</a> [opinion text] after the court overturned <span class="casename">Gonzalez</span> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-542.pdf">Arizona v. Gant</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-iran-compensation.php">report</a>]. The Eleventh Circuit refused to apply the exclusionary rule, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200816654.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that the search was objectively reasonable when relying on then-binding precedent and that the good faith exception allows the use of evidence obtained under reasonable reliance on well-settled precedent. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the court should reverse the good faith principle, saying:<blockquote>The Court has to properly construe the Fourth Amendment and the police need to then properly follow the Court's precedents. The Court can't turn away from the role of this Court's precedents in the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment. ... Under the government's proposed rule, defendants would have a limited ability to challenge precedents that construe the Fourth Amendment too narrowly, but of course of government would be free in any case to challenge precedents that the government believes construes the Fourth Amendment too broadly. The concern is that over time that would lead to an asymmetry in the Court's outcomes, not as a result of the measured judgments of this Court, but rather as a result of the incentives on counsel, and the Court should strive to avoid that sort of result.</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued that the exclusionary rule is not a personal individual right or a constitutional right, but rather a remedy the court has devised after finding a Fourth Amendment violation. "The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future conduct by other counterparts of that police officer or the police officer himself, so that when he confronts the situation in the future he will be more solicitous of Fourth Amendment rights." The government explained that if the court adopted another purpose for the rule, it would depart from its consistent holdings of the rule's purpose and "create pressure for litigants to urge that additional policy interests of the administration of justice would be served."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-11556.pdf">Tolentino v. New York</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-takes-two-criminal-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the exclusionary rule prohibits police from using a defendant's driving record compiled by the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) obtained after illegally stopping the defendant. The Court of Appeals of New York held that the exclusionary rule does not bar police from using evidence that a driver had his license suspended 10 previous times after police allegedly illegally stopped the vehicle. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the DMV records were fruit of the poisonous tree, saying:<blockquote> The problem with the categorical rule, is that it will create a fresh incentive for police officers to make these kind of suspicionless stops, and so it will encourage police to violate the Fourth Amendment. ... [T]his Court has always defined evidentiary fruit as something of evidentiary value which the public authorities have caused an arrested person to yield to them during an illegal detention ... the DMV records would fit that definition of evidentiary fruit. In this case, because it is the classic situation where there's sufficient causal connection between the Fourth Amendment violation and the subsequent discovery of the evidence to justify suppression, there's no reason not to apply the exclusionary rule here, and in fact, it meets all the definition of the sort of case where there would be very high level of deterrence as a result of applying the exclusionary rule.</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued that the DMV records should not be subject to suppression as they were already in the government's possession and therefore are not fruit of the poisonous tree or the product of any illegal government activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Blai</a> [ACLU materials] have standing to sue the US government over the constitutionality of a federal eavesdropping law, reinstating their lawsuit. The plaintiffs, including attorneys, journalists and rights organizations, facially <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-new.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] Section 702 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sec_50_00001881---a000-.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [50 USC &#167; 1881(a)], which was added by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.6304:">FISA Amendments Act of 2008</a> (FAA) [HR 6304 materials]. The law created procedures to allow electronic government surveillance of individuals living outside of the US for foreign intelligence purposes. The plaintiffs alleged that the law violated the Fourth Amendment, First Amendment and Article III of the Constitution. A 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from the US District Court in Manhattan found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not suffer an injury in fact and dismissed the suit. Plaintiffs appealed and argued that the fear of future government surveillance while performing work-related activities such as conducting interviews with possible targets caused an injury in fact through "economic and professional costs" expended to protect themselves. They also alleged that the law chilled their freedom of speech. The circuit court determined that this did constitute standing because the law directly affects them:<blockquote>[T]he FAA has put the plaintiffs in a lose-lose situation: either they can continue to communicate sensitive information electronically and bear a substantial risk of being monitored under a statute they allege to be unconstitutional, or they can incur financial and professional costs to avoid being monitored.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], a plaintiff in the case, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/victory-court-says-plaintiffs-can-challenge-bush-wiretapping-law">declared the ruling a victory</a> [press release] and applauded the court's decision to allow the law to be challenged.

<p>Last month, the ACLU chided the Senate's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/senate-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">extend surveillance provisions of the USA Patriot Act</a> [JURIST report]. The measures were set to expire on February 28, and the vote was seen as a delay tactic to allow for further debate about the provisions, which include roving wiretaps, "lone wolf" terrorism suspects and the government's ability to seize "any tangible items" in the course of surveillance. The Obama administration released a <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] earlier in February calling for a three-year renewal of the provisions.  The provisions were previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended</a> in February 2010 at the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">request</a> [JURIST reports] of the Obama administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last year, a woman sued <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] alleging that photos posted on Google Street View of the woman, her family and the front of her house violated her property and privacy rights. The court held last week that, because the photos were taken from the street, Google did not violate her property rights. Furthermore, the court found no further violations because Germans can opt out of the service, and Google blurs faces and license plates in the posted images. The ruling was <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14929074,00.html">narrowly focused on property rights</a> [DW report], ignoring larger data protection issues the company is currently confronting. The high court's ruling cannot be appealed.

<p>Google has recently faced a number of allegations from the international community related to violating privacy laws by capturing personal data through Google Street View cars, used for its Google Maps service. Most recently, the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/">French National Commission of Information Technology and Liberty</a> (CNIL) [official website, in French] fined Google 100,000 euros (USD $141,300) this week for <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/la-cnil/actu-cnil/article/article/google-street-view-la-cnil-prononce-une-amende-de-100-000-euros/?tx_ttnews[backPid]=2&cHash=cc38682f49">violating French data privacy laws</a> [press release, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-commission-fines-google-for-violating-data-privacy-laws.php">report</a>]. In November, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a> [official website] found that Google had committed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">"significant breach"</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] and required that Google delete the payload data it collected in the UK and implement employee training on privacy principles, security awareness and the Data Protection Act. Other countries, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-launches-legal-probe-into-google-privacy-violations.php">Canada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-launches-legal-probe-into-google-privacy-violations.php">Australia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports], have launched similar investigations into the privacy breach. The US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended its inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into Google's data collection through Street View cars after Google assured the FTC that it did not use any of the collected data and announced that it was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/creating-stronger-privacy-controls.html">committed to compliance with privacy laws</a> [text], instituting new training on privacy principles and appointing a new director of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-israel-president-convicted-of-rape.php">convicted Katsav</a> [JURIST report] in December, finding that he had assaulted a female employee of the Department of Tourism during his time as minister and two women at the President's Residence during his time as president. Katsav <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/former-president-moshe-katsav-gets-7-years-in-jail-for-rape-1.351092">must also serve two years of probation</a> [Haaretz report] and pay a total of 125,000 NIS ( USD $35,500) to his victims. The judge reading the sentence cited Katsav's <a href="http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=213254">pattern of repeated abuse</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] as a reason for the long sentence. In a minority opinion, one judge argued that Katsav should face only four years in prison. Katsav has continued to maintain his innocence, and his lawyer said he will <a href="http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=213262">appeal the sentence</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report], which is scheduled to begin May 8. Katsav is the highest ranking Israeli official ever sentenced to jail.

<p>Katsav was initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-indicted-on-rape.php">indicted on rape charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 for allegedly assaulting female employees in the 1990's. In 2008, Katsav <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">rejected a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] that would have permitted him to plead guilty to lesser charges of indecent assault, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice in exchange for a suspended sentence and the dropping of rape charges. The plea deal had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/israel-high-court-puts-katsav-plea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by women's and civil rights activists, prompting five separate petitions to overturn the agreement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The shareholders alleged that Matrixx failed to disclose reports of a possible link between the active ingredient in Zicam and loss of smell and that, in light of these reports, had made misleading statements to the public about Zicam's possible side effects. The unanimous opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1156">Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] held that the respondents representing the shareholders had stated a claim under <a href="http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec10.html">&#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and <a href="http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule10b-5.html">Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5</a> [texts] for employment of a manipulative or deceptive device. These laws require that the shareholders allege that Matrixx intentionally disclosed material information to investors. Matrixx claimed that the link between Zicam and loss of smell was not material because it was not statistically significant. The Supreme Court did not agree with such a bright-line rule:<blockquote>Although in many cases reasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse events to be material information, respondents have alleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors would have viewed these particular reports as material. Respondents have also alleged facts giving rise to a strong inference that Matrixx acted with the required state of mind.</blockquote>The court reasoned that oftentimes medical experts and the Food and Drug Administration rely on less than statistically significant data to prove causation and that a reasonable investor may be inclined to do the same. Matrixx also argued that that the shareholders did not allege facts sufficient to prove the scienter requirement. However, the court held the shareholders met their burden because, assuming the alleged facts to be true, there was a cogent and compelling inference that Matrixx withheld disclosure to prevent harmful impacts on the marketing of Zicam. 

<p>The decision upholds the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/28/06-15677.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the shareholders. Counsel for Matrixx had <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-disclosure-of-drug-reactions.php">argued during oral argument</a> [JURIST report] that the reports do not establish any reliable facts about the drug and that a duty to report these results would unfairly affect the company. Matrixx claimed that, absent evidence that "the company has knowledge of facts establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the drug itself is the cause of the reported event," neither the materiality nor scienter requirements of the securities laws were violated. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2000, Gongadze was kidnapped by ex-police officers, beaten, strangled, beheaded and buried. Following Gongadze's murder, in 2008, three former police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/ukraine-court-convicts-former-police.php">convicted and sentenced to jail</a> [JURIST report] by a Ukrainian court for their roles in carrying out the murder. Mykola Protasov was sentenced to 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych each received a 12-year sentence. In 2006, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/police-accused-of-murdering-ukraine.php">trial of the former police officers began</a> [JURIST report], but those who ordered the murder had not been found. In 2005, the commission investigating the murder said that the voices of Kuchma, Parliament speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn and other officials were heard on recordings where they were allegedly conspiring against Gongadze. The inquiry also accused Kuchma of ordering Gongadze's kidnapping and murder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-access-to-dna-testing.php">report</a>] that the language "filed any complaint" of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [text, PDF] refers to both oral and written complaints. Kasten brought an anti-retaliation suit against the respondent under the FLSA <a href="http://law.onecle.com/uscode/29/215.html">anti-retaliation provision</a> [29 USC &#167; 215(a)(3) text] arguing he was wrongfully discharged from employment for orally complaining to company officials about the location of timeclocks at the facility. The FLSA prohibits employers from terminating employment based on complaints "filed" by employees. Kasten verbally communicated his grievances about the location of the timeclocks to human resource managers, in compliance with the company's employee policy handbook. Saint-Gobain argued that the FLSA was not designed to protect employees only, but was established to ensure that employers had fair notice of employee grievances. The court pointed out that other similar statutes have been interpreted to include oral statements, and administrators and legislators have consistently held that similar language is meant to include oral complaints. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, also considered policy reasons supporting its interpretation of the contested language: <blockquote>Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement scheme's effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act's complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers? ... To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the filing of written complaints would also take needed flexibility from those charged with the Act's enforcement. It could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods of receiving complaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision covers complaints made to employers [...], it would discourage the use of desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.</blockquote>The court ultimately vacated and remanded the case. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, filed a dissent arguing that the statutory language does not apply to intra-company complaints in the first place.

<p>Saint-Gobain initially claimed that, because the anti-retaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the government, it is exempt from suit since Kasten's complaints were directed to a private employer. The Supreme Court refused to address this argument because, though Saint-Gobain raised and ultimately lost this argument in the lower courts, the company did not address the issue in its response to Kasten's petition for certiorari. Justices Scalia and Thomas disagreed with the majority, suggesting that the court has previously permitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised in the brief in opposition when doing so is "predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented, and therefore fairly included therein." In an earlier suit brought by Kasten, the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/opinions/pdfs/2006-2009/07-CV-449-BBC-06-02-08.PDF">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Saint-Gobain violated the FLSA by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from receiving credit for time they spent dressing in work-related protective gear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the court's Friday decision does not officially preclude the ARB from adopting or implementing the program in the future, it could delay the process as the ARB will now have to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/03/21/BAUF1IGAAT.DTL&tsp=1">conduct additional research</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> Report] on other available options and report back as to why the cap-and-trade program is superior as well as invite public comment on the issue. The suit against the ARB was brought by the <a href="http://www.crpe-ej.org/crpe/">Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment</a> [advocacy website], an environmental justice group that is representing other similar grassroots groups. Collectively, they argue that cap-and-trade programs, which establish limits on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST news archive], are still inadequate because they allow major emitters to buy credits from others instead of actually reducing their own emissions, ultimately endangering communities often composed of poor minorities. 

<p>The proposed cap-and-trade program is a major part of <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/docs/ab32text.pdf">Assembly Bill 32</a> (AB 32) [text, PDF; official <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cleanenergy/cleanenergy.htm">backgrounder</a>]. In December, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/california-regulators-approve-incentives-for-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions.php">ARB approved measures</a> [JURIST report] for the cap-and-trade program, which would provide incentives to companies and factories that decrease their greenhouse gas emissions. The provisions include a permit system in which companies are allotted a quota of greenhouse emissions. If a company does not use all of its quota, it can sell to a company that is going to exceed its quota. Companies that exceed their quota can purchase "offsets" from companies involved in activities that lessen greenhouse emissions, like forestry. The program is reportedly the first of this type in the country. Supporters of the bill in California say they felt compelled to enact AB 32 after Congress failed to approve greenhouse gas reduction legislation. They hope they other states will follow suit. AB 32 was first <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/schwarzenegger-signs-first-us-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, now 90 years old, was allegedly among Soviet prisoners-of-war <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12822736">recruited to work at the death camps by the SS</a> [BBC report]. Demjanjuk, however, has denied the charges against him and insisted he was a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014565459_apeugermanydemjanjuk.html">prisoner-of-war</a> [AP report] for most of the remainder of the conflict. The prosecution requested conviction on all 27,900 counts of accomplice to murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. Germany disallows consecutive sentencing, and the prosecutor requested only six years because of Demjanjuk's advanced age and because he was <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014565459_apeugermanydemjanjuk.html">already jailed for eight years in Israel</a> [AFP report] before his <a href="/thisday/2009/02/accused-nazi-war-criminal-john.php">conviction was overturned</a> [JURIST archives] by the Israeli Supreme Court. A verdict is expected sometime in May.

<p>Demjanjuk's trial, which began in November 2009, has been marked by extensive delay. In addition, the <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">Spanish National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] announced in January that it is <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/spain-seeks-extradition-of-accused-nazi-guard.php">seeking the extradition of Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST report] so he can stand trial on charges relating to his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/flossenburg.html">Flossenburg</a> [HRP backgrounder] concentration camp where 60 Spanish citizens were killed during World War II. Last May, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals relating to his health</a> [JURIST reports], although the court has limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was deported to Germany after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UN <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37847&Cr=protests&Cr1">expressed concern</a> [UN News Centre report] over violence against protesters in <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/790690.stm">Bahrain</a>, <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/801669.stm">Syria</a> and <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/784383.stm">Yemen</a> [BBC backgrounders]. Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the OHCHR, held a <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10878&LangID=E">press briefing</a> [text] detailing human rights violations in the three nations. Speaking on Bahrain, but summarizing the UN's feelings on alleged abuses in all three nations, he said:<blockquote>It is vital that the authorities scrupulously abide by international standards. People should not be arbitrarily arrested and should not be detained without clear evidence that they have committed a recognized crime. We stress again that demonstrating peacefully is not a crime. Giving an interview to a journalist is not by any stretch of the imagination a crime, nor is reporting human rights abuses.</blockquote>The OHCHR voiced <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37746&Cr=bahrain&Cr1=">similar concerns</a> [UN News Centre report] last week toward all three nations. The UN has received reports in Bahrain of arbitrary arrests of political activists, human rights defenders, doctors and nurses; 50&#8211;100 people missing; and allegations that protesters are orchestrating such events to smear the government. A <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">report</a> [text] was also released stating that UN human rights experts question the Bahraini government's commitment to human rights. In Syria, reports revolve around security forces responding aggressively and in some cases killing protesters. The UN's concerns in Yemen surround the same issues, with the addition of the deportation of two <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera</a> [media website] reporters. Also on Tuesday, Yemeni President <a href = "http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php?lng=en">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website] offered to <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011321164113728994.html">resign from office</a> [Al Jazeera report] by the end of the year.

<p>There have been varied protests and government reactions in all three nations throughout March. Opposition leaders were <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">arrested in Bahrain</a> [JURIST report] after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href = "http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana last week. Days before, Bahraini King <a href = "http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a three-month <a href = "http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, called on the King to impose martial law under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href = "http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. A <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/syria-military-court-jails-activist-accused-of-harming-iran-relations.php">military court in Syria</a> [JURIST report] sentenced a human rights activist accused of harming the country's relations with Iran to 18 months in prison. Ali Abdullah's sentence was based on allegations that he <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jk_rIV7SptKDuJ8CnrQ2PtabM91Q?docId=6236956">made critical comments against Iran</a> [AP report], thereby harming Syria's relations with a foreign country. In an interview last month, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad indicated he would push for political reforms including <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/08/syria-facebook-unbanned-people">municipal elections and a new media law</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Saleh <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">recently declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href = "http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/shownews.php?lng=ar&_nsid=9188">state of emergency</a> [text, in Arabic] in Yemen. The state of emergency will last 30 days and gives security forces greater powers to maintain order and also includes a ban on citizens carrying arms in public. This followed a promise the week before to <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-president-promises-new-constitution-as-protests-continue.php">create a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] guaranteeing parliamentary and judiciary freedoms. Protests, largely organized by the Joint Meeting Party (JMP), have been ongoing in Yemen since February, calling for Saleh to step down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href = "http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Fi]le=HB1217ENR.htm">law</a> [text], which <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-legislature-passes-bill-requiring-72-hour-waiting-period-for-abortions.php">passed through the Senate</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, contains the longest waiting period in the country and provides specifically that counseling must be sought at a "pregnancy help center ... which ... routinely consults with women for the purpose of helping them keep their relationship with their unborn children." The <a href = "http://www.aclusd.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota</a> (ACLUSD) and <a href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mn-nd-sd/">Planned Parenthood Federation of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota</a> [advocacy websites] plan to <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/south-dakota-governor-signs-law-creating-unprecedented-obstacles-women-s-health">challenge</a> [ACLU press release; Planned Parenthood <A href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mn-nd-sd/press-release-2-32372.htm">press release</a>] the law.

<p>Several state legislatures have acted recently to place restrictions abortions. Last week, the Missouri House of Representatives voted in favor of legislation <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">restricting late-term abortions</a> [JURIST report] and imposing penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. The Oklahoma House of Representatives <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. Last month, the Kansas House of Representatives also <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved several new restrictions on abortion</a> [JURIST report]. If the bills are approved by the Senate, Kansas residents will not be able to obtain an abortion after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. Other restrictions include a stringent parental consent and notification system for a minor's abortion and "clear and convincing" evidence for a judicial bypass of parental consent; the ability to bring a civil suit against abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; the right for criminal prosecution of abortion providers if they violate Kansas law; and for abortion providers to inform patients that the fetus is a "whole, separate, unique, living human being."

The new laws <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-23-yemen_N.htm">give the government greater power</a> [AP report] to arrest and detain protesters and to censor the media. The new laws follow Saleh's declaration last Friday of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">30-day state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. The measure passed easily as many minority party members of the 301-seat parliament did not attend the session. Saleh warned Tuesday that Yemen could face a civil war after opposition leaders rejected his offer to step down by the end of this year. The emergency laws expire in 30 days.

<p>Yemen is not the first country to declare a state of emergency in the midst of anti-government protests in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Bahraini lawmakers called on <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and invoke martial law after 5,000 protesters marched to demand an end to the monarchy. Bahrain officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] last week. Yemeni authorities have previously been criticized for their counter-terror methods. In August, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/yemen-counter-terror-methods-violate-human-rights-ai.php">criticized methods used by the government</a> [JURIST report] as violations of human rights.

The settlement was reached after over two years of negotiations between Google and the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/">Authors Guild</a> [advocacy website], a group seeking to preserve copyright protection for authors, and other plaintiffs including the <a href="http://www.publishers.org/">Association of American Publishers</a> (AAP) [association website], <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/">McGraw-Hill</a>, <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/aboutus/index.html">Penguin Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?feature_id=1625&amp;tab=1">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> [corporate websites]. Under the terms of the original settlement agreement, Google would pay $125 million to authors and publishers of copyrighted works. In return, Google would be allowed to display online up to 20 percent of the total pages of a copyrighted book, and would offer users an opportunity to purchase the remainder of any viewed book, regardless of whether Google actually had rights to the material. <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Judgesbio.htm#DC">Judge Denny Chin</a> [biographical materials] wrote in his opinion:<blockquote>While the digitization of books and the creation of a universal digital library would benefit many, the ASA (Amended Settlement Agreement) would simply go too far. It would permit this class action - which was brought against defendant Google Inc. to challenge its scanning of books and display of "snippets"; for on-line searching - to implement a forward-looking business arrangement that would grant Google significant rights to exploit entire books, without permission of the copyright owners. Indeed, the ASA would give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission, while releasing claims well beyond those presented in the case.</blockquote> Judge Chin is currently a circuit Judge for the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website], but issued his ruling as a district judge, as he had presided over the case before he was elevated to the circuit court.

<p>The original settlement agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, and arguments on the ASA were heard in February 2010, after which Judge Chin <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he would delay ruling on the proposed settlement. Earlier that month the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-urges-additional-revisions-to.php">statement of interest</a> [JURIST report] urging the court to reject the settlement due to copyright and antitrust concerns, and stating that the agreement would provide Google with "anticompetitive advantages" with potentially monopolistic effects. The DOJ's statement of interest was filed after an official inquiry, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-to-investigate-antitrust.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] six months after the original settlement agreement was reached. Meanwhile, concerns had been raised in the European Union and elsewhere that Google's book-scanning initiative violated national copyright laws, especially in France where a Parisian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-court-rules-google-book-search.php">fined Google</a> [JURIST report] &#8364;300,000 euros (USD $430,000) for digitizing books and making excerpts available on the web.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The joint commission has submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which took over after Mubarak's resignation, has instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [Ria Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in Egypt. Following the demonstrations, Egypt's chief prosecutor requested last month that Foreign Ministry officials take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-chief-prosecutor-seeks-to-freeze-ex-presidents-foreign-assets.php">freeze any foreign assets</a> [JURIST report] belonging to former president Mubarak and his family.

<p>Egypt has been heavily criticized by rights groups and international organizations for its handling of protesters. In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported new evidence that the Supreme Military Council of Egypt had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Through various detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." Also in February, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the Egyptian military was improperly <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">detaining protesters and allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report]. The report calculated at least 119 arbitrary detentions and five incidents of torture, providing detainee accounts. HRW contends that the military was targeting human rights activists, protesters and journalists. In January, UN officials including <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> and High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official websites], <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">urged the Egyptian government to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] and respect the rights of protesters. Pillay acknowledged reports of tactics including rubber-coated bullets, tear gas, water cannons and batons, and called on the government to investigate the reports of excessive force including civilian deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2008, France sought to prohibit production within its borders of MON 810, a GM strain of maize developed by US-based <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website], by citing a safeguard clause adopted by the EU in 2004. The clause is designed to allow EU member states to restrict previously approved products in the event that new evidence emerges indicating that the product in question is harmful to either humans or the environment. MON 810 was approved for use by the EU in 1998, and Mengozzi disagrees with applying the clause on the grounds that France imposed its ban without proper <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] consultation. Though such opinions are not binding, courts typically adopt the stance set forth by advocates general.  

<p>Courts and legislatures around the world have struggled with the increasingly prevalent issue of GM crops.  A US judge in December <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-orders-destruction-of-genetically-engineered-plants.php">ordered the destruction of a crop</a> [JURIST report] of Monsanto-produced GM sugar beets because of the potentially harmful effect the plants may have on surrounding flora, marking the first time such an order was issued in the US. A week earlier, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-high-court-upholds-genetically-modified-crop-restrictions.php">upheld restrictions on GM crops</a> [JURIST report], including "buffer zones" between GM and conventional crops, after finding that the legislature had acted in the public interest when passing them. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-injunction-against-genetically-modified-seed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-475">Monsanto Company v.

An agency known as the Rapid Response Unit (RRU), which serves as Uganda's violent crime police task force, is reported to have falsified confessions and utilized beatings with batons, glass bottles and metal sticks to extract information. The report also raises concerns involving journalistic freedom and violations of privacy and speech. The report's summary describes the type of violence instituted by the RRU:<blockquote>During more than 13 months of research, Human Rights Watch carried out over 100 interviews in regions where R.R.U is most active. ... Drawing on interviews with victims of abuses, as well as current and former RRU employees, researchers documented serious human rights violations by RRU since its formal establishment in 2007. RRU officers routinely use unlawful force during arrest, including beating suspects and, in one instance that Human Rights Watch documented, shooting a handcuffed suspect. RRU personnel were allegedly responsible for at least six extrajudicial killings in 2010 alone, frequent use of torture during interrogations to extract confessions, and prolonged illegal and sometimes incommunicado detention of suspects at RRU headquarters in Kireka, Kampala, and other locations.</blockquote>The report urges the government to comply with its own <a href="http://www.ugandaemb.org/Constitution_of_Uganda.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF] and international human rights law prohibiting torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The new RRU commander has promised reform, installing a telephone line for the purpose of receiving complaints. 

<p>In 2009, HRW called on Uganda to end what it said was the <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/rights-group-urges-uganda-to-end.php">use of torture and unlawful arrest</a> [JURIST report] by the country's Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force (JATT). According to HRW, JATT engaged in 106 documented cases of illegal or prolonged detentions between August 2008 and February 2009 and employed torture methods against both <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/lra.htm">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] rebels and political opponents of the government. JATT alleges that tactics such as concealing arresting officers' identities and affiliations, disorienting suspects by blindfolding them while in transport, failing to inform detainees of the reason for their arrest, long-term incommunicado detention and interrogations involving torture, were employed in the name of combating terrorism, despite being in violation of international law.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

North Carolina</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-juvenile-miranda-rights.php">report</a>] on whether a court should consider a juvenile's age when determining whether the individual is in custody for purposes of the Miranda warning as set forth in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0384_0436_ZS.html">Miranda v. Arizona</a> [opinion text]. In this case, the juvenile student made incriminating statements to two law enforcement officers after being removed from a classroom, and the Supreme Court of North Carolina <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/sc/opinions/2009/pdf/190-09-1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the student was not in custody when he made the statements and therefore not entitled to the protections of Miranda or <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_7B/GS_7B-2101.html">North Carolina statute 7B-2101(a)</a> [text]. Attorneys for JDB <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_09_11121_Petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf">argue</a> [brief, PDF] that age is an objective factor that must be included in the objective test for determining whether an individual would feel free to stop the questioning and leave the area. Among the factors to be considered in this case, according to JDB's attorneys, is that JDB at the time was 13 years old, he had been pulled from class, and he was questioned in a room with two police officers, the principal, and the principal's assistant. Counsel for JDB relied heavily on the Supreme Court's opinions in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0387_0001_ZS.html">In re Gault</a> [opinion text], which extended Miranda protections to juveniles, and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/370/49/case.html">Gallegos v. Colorado</a> [opinion text], in which the court stated that a 14-year-old child is "unable to know how to protect his own interests or how to get the benefits of his constitutional rights." The state <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/previewbriefs/09_11121_brief_updates/09-11121_RespondentBrief.authcheckdam.pdf">argues</a> [brief, PDF] that the petitioner's argument employs a subjective, rather than objective, test which does not comport with Supreme Court jurisprudence on the Miranda warning. Including age in the evaluation would, in the state's view, complicate the job of police as they question individuals. The state contends in its brief that age is a subjective factor, similar to emotional state or level of intoxication in its effect on whether the individual under questioning would feel free to leave.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-10.pdf">Turner v. Rogers</a> [oral arguments transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-juvenile-miranda-rights.php">report</a>], the court will consider whether an indigent individual has a <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] right to counsel in a civil contempt proceeding, where the result of such proceeding was the defendant's imprisonment. The petitioner, Michael Turner, was found to be in civil contempt for failure to pay court-ordered child support payments. Turner's attorneys <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_2010_2011_10_10_Petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf">argue</a> [brief, PDF] that the court did not inform Turner of his right to counsel, and that any competent attorney would have been able to successfully argue that Turner's indigence, a complete defense to a contempt for failure to pay, would have kept Turner out of jail. The state <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/previewbriefs/Other_Brief_Updates/10-10_Respondent.authcheckdam.pdf">argues</a> [brief, PDF] that the right to counsel only applies in criminal contempt proceedings, but Turner's attorneys argue that here, where the incarceration is punitive and not merely a coercion to recoup the outstanding support payments, Turner is entitled to counsel. The state's argument involves a significant amount of policy background on the problems facing individuals who cannot recover court-ordered support payments, and that theme was reflected in the opening statements of the custodial parent's counsel. A sizable portion of respondent's argument time, however, devolved into matters of procedure and whether certain matters that were discussed, particularly whether the case implicates procedural Due Process, were within the scope of the question presented. </p>]]></content:encoded>

At the court-martial, held at <a href="http://info.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/">Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a> [official website], Morlock also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gTXOUyEaW7Lq66IfYkHvFtWkr66Q?docId=9fd5d8b33c854ae1b51b899f907f6425">pleaded guilty</a> [AP report] to one count each of assault, conspiracy, obstructing justice and illegal drug use in exchange for a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison. According to the <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/118509114.html">plea-agreement</a> [AP report], Morlock agreed to testify against his co-defendants. Four other soldiers in Morlock's unit, the 5th Stryker Brigade, are also charged with the deaths of the three Afghan men, which occurred in the Kandahar province in January, February and May of last year. Morlock told the military judge, Lieutenant Colonel Kwasi Hawks, that he and his fellow soldiers began plotting the murders of unarmed Afghans in 2009 and killed the three civilians knowing they were unarmed and posed no legitimate threat. Morlock testified that Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, who is also charged, took the lead in developing the plot. Gibbs <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014573796_morlockcourtmartial24m.html">maintains</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] that the deaths were a result of combat. In January, the <em>Washington Post</em> first reported that Morlock accepted the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-accepts-plea-washington-post.php">plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] offered by <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] prosecutors. Morlock, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] June, is the first of the five soldiers to be court-martialed.

<p>Investigations into the 5th Stryker Brigade have led to additional charges for lesser crimes against seven other soldiers. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrifying civilians.  Earlier in the week, the US Army had <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">ordered a court-martial</a> [JURIST report] for Staff Sgt. David Bram, who was accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep him from informing about alleged drug abuse within the unit.  The Army announced in May that its Criminal Investigation Command was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">opening an investigation into the civilian deaths</a> [JURIST report] in Kandahar.  These charges are the latest in a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  In April, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial.  Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">reduced from 15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi civilian.  In December 2009, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl.  Green was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-sentences-ex-us-soldier.php">five consecutive life terms</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/senate/senate.htm">Idaho Senate</a> [official website] voted 24-10 on Wednesday to approve a <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1165.pdf#xml=http://legislature.search.idaho.gov/isysquery/42acebbb-2b34-488f-b65b-37acca730046/2/hilite/">bill</a> [SB 1165, PDF] that would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. The "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," similar to bills <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">passed in Nebraska</a> last year and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved in Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">Missouri</a> [JURIST reports] last week, is based on evidence suggesting that a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/10/us-oklahoma-abortion-idUSTRE7290C420110310">fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report]. Also on Wednesday, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/senate/">Kansas Senate</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_03_0000.pdf">similar bill</a> [HB 2218, PDF], with a vote of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/24/us-kansas-abortion-idUSTRE72N0J120110324">24-13</a> [Reuters report], that would prohibit most abortions after 21 weeks of gestation. The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/house/">Kansas House</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved the same bill</a> [JURIST report] in February. The legislation in both Idaho and Kansas does permit abortions after the 20- or 21-week mark, respectively, only in cases where the mother's life is at risk or she faces serious injury. Doctors who perform abortions after that would be subject to criminal prosecution, but there would be no penalty for women undergoing the procedure. Idaho's "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act" will now be forwarded to the House for approval and is expected to pass, while Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/home">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] is expected sign the Kansas provision into lawn. 

<p>Some groups have criticized the recent passage of Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Acts throughout the country, asserting that they violate the Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text], which allows for abortions until the fetus can survive viably outside the womb, typically at 22 or 23 weeks. State legislatures have also been implementing other measures to restrict abortions. Earlier this week, South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard signed into law a bill requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">wait three days</a> [JURIST report] before obtaining an abortion. In December the Alaska Superior Court upheld a <a href="/2010/12/alaska-judge-upholds-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">parental consent notification law</a>, whereas in November, Colorado voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">rejected an amendment</a> [JURIST reports] that would have granted fetuses a "personhood" status, effectively banning abortion. In June, then-Florida governor Charlie Crist <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] in May requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. This followed <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">laws passed the month before</a> [JURIST report], prohibiting abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus, protecting medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs, and regulating the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has yet to rule on the decree, many citizens were outraged and have <a href = "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8484/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-to-protest-against-antiprotest-law-.aspx">planned a protest for Friday</a> [<em>Al-Ahram</em> report]. Strikes have been ongoing since the recent revolution, with postal workers, police officers, hospital staff, railway workers, lawyers and journalists, among other groups, continuing to strike for better work conditions and pay. The decree would criminalize any protests, strikes or sit-ins that negatively affect the economy, as well as those who call for or incite action, with a maximum sentence of one year in prison and fines of up to half a million pounds. According to the decree:<blockquote>The Cabinet reasserted the necessity of immediate stoppage of all demonstrations and strikes witnessed nationwide especially that the cabinet has received huge amount of legal demands and responded to them, and other demands are studied, and that the government is working to prepare a complete frame to deal with policies of employment and incomes.</blockquote>Last month, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">pledged to lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that were in place for nearly 30 years once circumstances in the country improved. The Council also vowed to have a peaceful transition to power and promised not to prosecute "honourable people who refused corruption and demanded for reform." The cabinet's decree also established guidelines for creating new political parties.

<p>Earlier this week, an overwhelming majority of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-citizens-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-constitutional-reform.php">citizens voted yes to constitutional reforms</a> [JURIST report], including parliamentary elections within the next six months. The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces last month announced the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-appoints-judges-to-amend-constitution.php">formation of the judicial committee</a> [JURIST report] to oversee amending the Egyptian constitution. When the council assumed power, it indicated that part of its <a href = "http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1102/S00429/egypt-constitutional-proclamation.htm">transition plan</a> [proclamation text] was to form a committee to amend constitutional articles prior to holding a public referendum. The plan followed the intentions of ousted president Hosni Mubarak, who had approved the <A href = "/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-vp-announces-political-agreements-and-committee-to-reform-constitution.php">formation of a panel</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution before he resigned. Mubarak stepped down after <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121161511674298.html">nearly three weeks of demonstrations</a> [Al Jazeera report] protesting the Egyptian government and calling for his resignation. During the three weeks of protests leading up to Mubarak's resignation, nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ETA is an organization committed to fighting for full nationhood of the Basque region of Spain and France. Spanish and French authorities have proscribed this group as a terrorist organization that is blamed for the deaths of over 800 people. According to the court, Sortu is a successor of the banned ETA-linked party <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna </a>[BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>]. Sortu was created following ETA's January declaration of a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/01/07/spain.eta.announcement/index.html">permanent ceasefire </a> [CNN report] in Spain and was in response to ETA pro-independence groups deciding against violent measures as an effective way to seek an independent Basque state.  Although Sortu has rejected violence, the court's concerns that the ETA has not permanently disbanded prevents the court from taking the new political party seriously. The court's ruling will bar Sortu from participating in May's upcoming elections. Sortu will be able to appeal the court's decision, but the appeals court will unlikely reach a verdict before the elections. The court will release its reasoning for denying Sortu legal status later this week. 

<p>ETA killings and attacks have dramatically declined in Spain and France in the past few years in response to increased judicial crackdowns, which are largely responsible for weakening the group. Most notably, in December a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-court-sentences-basque-separatist-leader-to-20-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former ETA Basque separatist leader Mikel Albizu Iriarte to 20 years in prison. In the same month, a French appeals court sentenced another former ETA leader, Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea, to seven years in prison for association with a terrorist organization. Last year, the Spanish <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-court-sentences-former-basque.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Arnaldo Otegi, a former leader of Batasuna , to two years in prison for promoting terrorism. In June 2009 the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-spain-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Spain's ban of Basque political groups Batasuna and Herri Batasuna for their alleged ties to ETA.<br />

The resolution was <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10888&LangID=E">adopted</a> [press release] by a vote of 22 in favor, 7 against and 14 abstentions. The Special Rapporteur is required to present an interim report to the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to the nineteenth session of the UNHRC. The US and two additional co-sponsors drafted the resolution, due to concerns expressed by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] in an <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A.HRC.16.75_AUV.pdf">interim report</a> [pdf] on the situation of human rights in Iran.  The interim report expressed concerns over alleged increase in executions, amputations, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials, and possible ill-treatment of human rights opposition activists. Iran spoke at the session as a concerned country and drew attention to Iran's cooperation with the UN and US on human rights issues: <blockquote>The approach of Iran to the promotion and protection of human rights was based and emanated from its religious and cultural background and its international commitments. The Government of Iran had worked wholeheartedly to ensure the human rights of its people. At the international level, Iran had extended full cooperation to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and had extended invitations to Special Rapporteurs and had received them on six different occasions. Providing true and timely communications at the request of Special Procedures had been a constant. The Human Rights Council had reviewed and adopted the Universal Periodic Review Outcome on the Islamic Republic of Iran and they had already extended an invitation to the High Commissioner to visit the country this year...Whatever the result of the action would be, Iran would continue its efforts to the promotion and protection of human rights which were inherent, genuine and deeply rooted in its values.
</blockquote>Bangladesh, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Mauritania, Pakistan, and Russia voted against the resolution. Pakistan, Cuba, Uruguay, China , Brazil and Mauritania spoke in general comments and explanations of the vote before the vote. They expressed a preference for dealing with the issue through dialogue and expressed confidence in Iran's continued cooperation with the UN human rights system. Also on Thursday, the Council renewed the mandate of its special investigator on the situation in the North Korea.

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized due to alleged human rights abuses.  In January, the <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [official website] claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours.  Earlier in January, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [Guardian report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Also, in January, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">would prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report] for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Menendez is already currently <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-life.php">serving another life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for the 1977 kidnapping, torture and killing of four political dissidents. Menendez, a former general for the Third Army Corps, commanded the secret prison "La Perla" for Argentina's military dictatorship. A panel of judges found him guilty of <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1360011-cadena-perpetua-por-sexta-vez-a-menendez">executing a violent police raid</a> [<em>La Nacion</em> report, in Spanish] on a home where members of an anti-government group were meeting. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or "disappeared" during the government's campaign against suspected dissidents during the country's Dirty War.

<p>Argentina continues to prosecute those accused of committing human rights abuses during the Dirty War. Earlier this month, an Argentine court commenced the trial of former dictators <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&L=5&tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=jorge-rafael_videla_151&cHash=0bcbee03a1">Jorge Videla</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jorge+videla">news archive</a>] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] for allegedly overseeing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-begins-trial-over-dirty-war-baby-thefts.php">systematic plan to steal babies</a> [JURIST report] born to political prisoners. In December, Videla was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/argentina-ex-dictator-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity. In June, trial proceedings were commenced for five ex-military officials allegedly responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">death of 65 left-wing activists</a> [JURIST report]. In May, Argentine <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/argentina-ex-secret-agent-arrested-on-dirty-war-abuse-charges.php">authorities arrested</a> [JURIST report] former secret service agent Miguel Angel Furci on charges of human rights abuses. Furci, a former agent of the Secretariat of State Intelligence (SIDE), was charged with 70 kidnappings and the torture of detainees at Orletti. Also in May, the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-extradites-pilot-to-argentina-for-alleged-role-in-dirty-war.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] pilot Julio Alberto Poch to Argentina to face trial for his alleged role.

The case will move on to the state <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which will decide whether a court has the authority to enjoin the secretary of state's publication of the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [SB 11 text, PDF] before it becomes law. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], filed last week by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> (D) [official website], alleges that Republican legislators did not follow the state's <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text], a rule requiring 24 hours notice or two hours if there is an emergency, before a public meeting. The Court of Appeals passed the case to the state's Supreme Court because it involves "significant issues" and cited the high court as the "proper forum" to resolve them: <blockquote>This case presents several significant issues involving justiciability and the remedies that are available under Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law. As we will explain below, we believe that resolution of these questions will require clarification of the interaction between the Open Meetings Law and a line of cases dealing with the separation of powers doctrine... Plainly, this case has broad statewide implications for the general public and those most directly affected by the challenged Act, in addition to those interested in the manner of its passage. Accordingly, we certify the petition for leave to appeal and accompanying motion for temporary relief to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</blockquote>A majority of the court's seven justices must agree to hear the suit before the case can move forward.  

<p>Ozanne's suit was the second such challenge by a state official, following a <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">similar suit</a> [complaint] filed by Dane <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> (D) [official profile]. On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> (R) [official website] asked the court to <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/files/Petition11CV1244.pdf">block</a> [motion, PDF] the Dane County <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Circuit Court</a> [official website] order. He also asked for leave to appeal the order and for relief consisting of an order to stay the circuit court's ruling. Van Hollen argues that the Dane County Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because the four named defendants, who are all state legislators, enjoy legislative immunity during the regular legislative term. He also argued that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the publishing of the law. The provisions of the Budget Repair Bill limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since mid-February, when the bill was introduced. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law by <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> (R) [official website] on March 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Presidential spokesperson Buthaina Shaaban said that the government <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110325/world-news/syria-may-end-emergency-law-frees-detained-activists">might repeal the emergency law</a> [AFP report], which bans political protests, in addition to making other reforms such as releasing political prisoners, allowing the formation of political parties and raising the salaries of government employees. The announcement may be an effort to stop ongoing protests, which have escalated since last week. In the southern city of Daraa, as many as 36 protesters have allegedly been <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/24/syria-security-forces-kill-dozens-protesters">killed by police</a> [HRW news report] since March 18. Other protesters were arrested, though the government announced that all the <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0324/syria.html">protesters have since been released from prison</a> [RTE report]. The government has been promising reforms since January, when al-Assad announced in an interview that he would push for political reforms including <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703833204576114712441122894.html">municipal elections and a new media law</a> [WP interview]. Another <a href="http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2011/03/24/1933600/syrian-government-promises-reform.html">protest was planned in Damascus</a> [LAT report] on Friday, despite the government's promised reforms.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-office-concerned-over-violence-in-yemen-bahrain-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over violence against protesters in Syria. A military court in Syria last week <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-military-court-jails-activist-accused-of-harming-iran-relations.php">sentenced a human rights activist</a> [JURIST report] accused of harming the country's relations with Iran to 18 months in prison. Ali Abdullah's sentence was based on allegations that he made <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jk_rIV7SptKDuJ8CnrQ2PtabM91Q?docId=6236956">critical comments against Iran</a> [AP report], thereby harming Syria's relations with a foreign country. Last month, Syria appeared to be <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">lifting the four-year-old ban</a> [JURIST report] on social media sites <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=facebook">news archive</a>] and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] as a <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=2&articleId=73460">concession to avoid popular upheaval</a> [DP report]. The Syrian protests may have been inspired by the recent unrest in Egypt, where nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded during the three weeks of protests that led to the February <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo said that his office is coordinating with a number of law enforcement organizations, including Interpol, in an investigation into six separate incidents in which Gaddafi is alleged to have ordered massive shooting attacks on peaceful protests, a process he said is certain to result in charges. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/war-crimes-prosecution-for-attacks-on-libya-civilians-warns-icc.php">warned Libyan officials last week</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfAsTXOozbY">video</a>] that any violence against civilians in the rebel-held capital Benghazi would result in prosecution for war crimes. His warning followed  <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/arab-league-calls-for-un-no-fly-zone-over-libya.php">calls for a UN-imposed no-fly zone</a> [JURIST report] over the Middle Eastern nation after reports surfaced indicating that Gaddafi had been using aircraft attacks to combat civilian protests. Shortly before the UN vote authorizing the resolution, Gaddafi threatened an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/africa/18libya.html">imminent attack on Benghazi</a> [NYT report]. Although the Libyan government responded to the ICC's warning with <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110318/ap_on_re_af/af_libya">promises of a ceasefire</a> [AP report], the attacks have continued.

<p>Earlier this month, the ICC launched a probe to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">investigate allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government. Moreno-Ocampo specifically identified Gaddafi, his sons and his political allies as targets of the investigation and warned Libyan officials that complicity in such abuses would result in prosecution. Additionally, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">appointed a team of special prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations that Gaddafi ordered forces to torture and abduct opponents. Gaddafi is accused of ordering hospital patients' executions, firing on crowds of protesters and using other extreme tactics against his opponents. The UN General Assembly has voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi. The ICC has also said that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">not grant immunity</a> [JURIST report] to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Royce Lamberth of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] dismissed the suit because of Convertino's inability to identify who within the DOJ he believed had leaked details of the DOJ's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=convertino">misconduct investigation of Convertino</a> [JURIST news archive] to a reporter from the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> in 2004. Lamberth detailed the lengthy history of the suit, saying, "Seven years of litigation have sapped the resources of more than one United States District Court." One of the main reasons that Lamberth identified for dismissing the suit was the necessity of Convertino's ability to identify the alleged leaker. Because Convertino could not do so, Lamberth wrote: <blockquote>Part of the reason Convertino has to know the leaker's identity in order to defeat DOJ's Motion for Summary Judgment is that without it, he cannot show that the DOJ employee who allegedly leaked information to the Detroit Free Press was acting within the scope of his or her DOJ employment at the time of the leak. In order for an agency to be liable for a Privacy Act violation allegedly committed by one of its employees, the responsible agency employee must have been acting within the scope of his or her employment. Therefore, even if Convertino could prove that the leak must have come from a DOJ employee-which he cannot-his claim would fail because no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that any such DOJ employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time of the leak.</blockquote>David Ashenfelter, the reporter whose 2004 story initiated Convertino's suit, has repeatedly refused to identify the source.

<p>The DOJ investigation into Convertino's alleged misconduct centered on his conduct in a terrorism case in Detroit in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Convertino was found <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-doj-prosecutor-found-not-guilty-of.php">not guilty of obstruction of justice</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 for his part in the botched prosecution. Convertino had <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/federal-prosecutor-entangled-in.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from the Department in May 2005 in the fallout from that case. In the original trial, two of the defendants were convicted, only to have their <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/detroit-terror-suspect-released-after.php">sentences overturned</a> [JURIST report] in 2004 by the judge due to the allegations that the prosecution did not turn over the satellite photos alleged to be exculpatory by the DOJ to the defense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Maria Claudia Garcia Iruretagoyena de Gelman was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/world/americas/25uruguay.html?_r=1">abducted from Argentina in 1976</a> [NYT report] and transferred to a detention center in Uruguay, where she disappeared while in the custody of government forces. The court's ruling effectively overturns Uruguay's <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15848">Expiry Law</a> [text, in Spanish], which granted military officials immunity for human rights violations that occurred during the country's <a href="http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/22.htm">1973-1985 dictatorship</a> [Country Studies backgrounder]. In 2009, Uruguayan voters <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed to overturn the law</a> [JURIST report] in a voter referendum that required only 50 percent majority to nullify the law.

In addition to ordering an investigation into Gelman's abduction, the IACHR also ordered the Uruguayan government to make a public apology for crimes committed by the government dictatorship.

<p>Many of the alleged kidnappings and deaths occurred in connection with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3720724.stm">Operation Condor</a> [BBC backgrounder], a cooperative effort between the governments of Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Chile to eliminate left-wing political opponents. In June, ex-military officials in Argentina were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for the deaths of 65 activists in connection with Operation Condor. The Uruguayan government has also attempted to bring those responsible for the disappearance of leftist activist to justice. In 2006, eight former police and military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/uruguay-indicts-8-for-operation-condor.php">indicted by a Uruguayan court</a> [JURIST report] on counts of kidnapping and conspiracy committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship. The crimes were related to the 1976 disappearances of five members of an Uruguayan leftist group who fled to Argentina and were detained there by police, and who investigators suspect were victims of Operation Condor.</p>

The court ruled that the <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/aviation/228591/pad-ordered-to-pay-b522m-to-aot">yellow shirts illegally interfered</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> story] with the operation of the Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi international airports, Thailand's two biggest hubs, by effecting a blockade that left more than 300,000 travelers stranded and cost the Thai economy more than 3 billion baht a day just in lost imports and exports at Suvernbahumi. The yellow shirts, a pro-establishment nationalist movement primarily driven by Thailand's upper-class and military establishments, allies of Thai <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [BBC profile], incited thousands to occupy the airports as part of their effort to force the resignation of the Thai government under Somchai Wongsawat, who was appointed prime minister in 2008 when former PM <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile], his brother-in-law, was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/world/asia/18thai.html?ref=somchaiwongsawat">ousted</a> [NYT report]. The yellow shirts <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/thailand-court-disbands-ruling-party.php">ended their protests</a> in 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/thailand-pm-demotes-police-chief-as.php">released the airports</a> [JURIST reports] after Thailand's Constitutional Court ordered a dissolution of the ruling government and removed Wongsawat, opening the door for Vejjajiva to assume the office.

<p>In December, the Bangkok Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/thai-protesters-sentenced-for-2008-television-station-takeover.php">sentenced 84 members of the yellow shirt movement</a> [JURIST report] to between six and 30 months in prison for their roles in the 2008 invasion of Thailand's top government-owned television station, the <a href="http://nbttv.prd.go.th/">National Broadcasting Service of Thailand</a> (NBD) [media website, in Thai]. The takeover, which shut the station down for several hours, was part of their campaign against Wongsawat's government. That September, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/thailand-court-convicts-yellow-shirts-of-slandering-ex-pm.php">convicted two former yellow shirt television personalities</a> [JURIST report] of defaming Thaksin by accusing him of insulting the monarchy.

In June, the Thai government indicated it would study the possibility of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/thailand-court-charges-11-red-shirt-protest-leaders-with-terrorism.php">extending amnesty to red shirt protesters</a> [JURIST report] convicted of minor offenses in order to facilitate reconciliation within the country. The offer of amnesty would not be given to the protesters charged with terrorism but could be extended to the 27 red shirt protesters who were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-court-sentences-protesters-to-six-months-in-prison.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] for violating the emergency decree prohibiting political gatherings of more than five people. The protests <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-government-imposes-curfew-in-bangkok.php">came to an end</a> [JURIST report] in May when red shirt leaders surrendered to police, which led to rioting, arson and the imposition of a curfew to protect citizens of Bangkok and its surrounding areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A court in the country's town of Arkhangelsk handed out sentences ranging from 7 to 12 years in prison. Three of the hijackers were stateless, while the other three were respectively from Russian, Latvia and Estonia. The MV Arctic Sea, originally of Malta, was hijacked by the men in July of 2009 and cut off contact with the outside world shortly thereafter. The ship was found about two months later by the Russian navy and seized.

<p>Last month, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-nearly-34-years.php">sentenced Somali pirate Abduwali Muse to 34 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for the 2009 hijacking of the vessel Maersk Alabama. Muse had originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/somalia-piracy-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-federal-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May to hijacking, kidnapping and taking hostages in the matter. Muse has claimed to be a minor at the time of the attack on the Maersk Alabama, an item used by his defense team in an effort to have the sentence reduced. Judge Loretta Preska, unswayed by the defense, imposed a sentence on the high end of the range of possible sentences, saying that such a long prison term was necessary to deter piracy. Piracy near the continent of Africa has become an increasingly serious problem for private shipowners and many nations. Also last month, a Norwegian ship owner suggested that pirates should be executed on the spot when they attempt to hijack ships, a stance that drew criticism from the Norwegian government.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill lists certain rights included in its definition, including the ability to adopt a child and share benefits. Despite these protections, the text of the Act adds that "The Act shall not be construed to create a marriage between the parties to a civil union, create or recognize a legal status similar to marriage, or alter the public policy of this state that recognizes only the union of one man and one woman as a marriage." The bill will now advance to the House of Representatives where its <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/25/us-colorado-gays-idUSTRE72O0BQ20110325">passage is uncertain</a> [Reuters report]. <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/GovHickenlooper/CBON/1249674240538">Governor John Hickenlooper</a> (D) [official website] has pledged to sign the measure into law if it is approved by the House.

The legislation will go into effect on January 1, 2012, and extends the same rights, benefits, protections and responsibilities of spouses in a marriage to partners in a civil union. Also in February, Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions.

Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">faces charges of politically motivated corruption</a> [JURIST report] and violation of the 1977 Amnesty Law, which affords amnesty for Franco-era crimes. The charges are based on Garzon's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">2008 order</a> [JURIST report] for certain government agencies, the <a href="http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/">Episcopal Conference</a> [church website, in Spanish], the <a href="http://www.ugr.es/">University of Granada</a> [academic website, in Spanish] and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. The <a href="http://www.interights.org/home/index.htm">International Centre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights</a> (INTERIGHTS) [advocacy website], a London-based NGO representing Garzon, claims he opened the investigation at the request of families and representatives of the regime's victims, and should be granted judicial immunity from such allegations.  INTERIGHTS also argues that the Spanish courts lack sufficient grounds for trial:<blockquote>Judge Garzon has been prosecuted under Spain's prevarication (or malfeasance) law, which allows judges to be prosecuted for unjust judgments. Normally the prosecution of judges under this law in Spain and the prosecution of judges generally in European States is highly exceptional. According to prior decisions of the Spanish courts, judges can only be prosecuted for unjust decisions that are irrational, perverse or objectively unsustainable. There is no basis in Spanish or international law for a judge to be prosecuted for reasoned interpretations of the law. The prosecution of judges for their decisions, specifically for their interpretations of the law, rather than the appeal or review of those decisions within the normal legal framework, violates the fundamental principle of the independence of judges.</blockquote> It may take weeks for the ECHR to decide whether to hear his case.  

<p>Garzon has faced turmoil since his 2008 decision to exhume the mass graves. In September, the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. The board of judges <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Supremo/respalda/sentar/Garzon/banquillo/memoria/historica/elpepuesp/20100907elpepunac_5/Tes">denied</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] Garzon's appeal of the order, although his trial is still pending. If convicted, Garzon could face a suspension of up to 20 years. In May, the Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/cgpj/principal.htm">General Counsel of the Judiciary</a> (CGPJ) [official website, in Spanish] voted unanimously to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-judicial-panel-suspends-judge-garzon-over-franco-probe.php">suspend</a> [JURIST report] Garzon. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] will send an independent, international commission to investigate allegations of serious human rights abuses during <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">post-election violence in the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST news archive], the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10893&LangID=E">announced</a> [press release] Friday. The resolution, which was passed without a vote, was introduced by Nigeria on behalf of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/AfricaRegionIndex.aspx">African Group</a> [UN profile] which stated "immediate action" was necessary to put an end to the violence. The commission will be appointed by the Council President and will investigate all allegations of abuse throughout the country. The commission will present its findings at the Council's 17th Session in late May. Speaking on behalf of the Ivory Coast, Kouadio Adjoumani <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10893&LangID=E">thanked the UN</a> [statement] for its interest in his country's situation: <blockquote>It [the commission] would renew their hope that the international community had not abandoned them and that it was seriously concerned about the worsening situation in this country. Also, the resolution would establish the international panel of inquiry which reassured the country that the perpetrators would not go unpunished. The unacceptable attacks on civilians that were currently going on around Abidjan might constitute crimes against humanity and should be investigated by the International Criminal Court. The delegation realised that some of the issues discussed during the negotiation of the resolution were of a sensitive nature, but the final point of the resolution was the protection of civilians who were paying the heavy price. There was a need to move beyond the rhetoric towards concrete steps to ensure that human rights were protected throughout the world.</blockquote> According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37899&Cr=Ivoire&Cr1=">report</a> [press release] released Friday by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/">UN</a> [official website], at least 1 million people in the Ivory Coast have been displaced from their homes due to "mounting violence" and fear of an "all-out war".  The UN expressed concern over the "rapidly deteriorating" human rights situation in the country, citing increased heavy artillery attacks and widespread panic of residents. OCHA<a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA"> Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] requested those involved to <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/VDUX-8F9SGZ?OpenDocument&RSS20&RSS20=FS">respect the rights</a> [press release] of civilians and humanitarian organizations throughout the country. 

<p>Earlier this month, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">called for an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into post-election violence as part of a report to the UNHRC. In January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-sg-rejects-calls-for-ivory-coast-recount.php">rejected the proposed recount</a> [JURIST report] of November's Ivory Coast presidential runoff election results as a "grave injustice and unfortunate precedent." Also in January, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] on continued post-election violence in the Ivory Coast, cautioning that genocide could be imminent. In December, UN officials urged all parties to the disputed presidential election in the Ivory Coast to honor the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-urges-parties-to-prevent-ethnic-crimes-in-post-election-ivory-coast.php">commitment to prevent genocide</a> [JURIST report], crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing under the <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement">2005 World Summit Outcome Document</a> [text, PDF]. Also in December, the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] urged Gbagbo to step down, <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/ECOWAS%20threatens%20forced%20removal%20of%20Ivory%20Coast%20president.php">threatening the use of force</a> [JURIST report] if he attempts to maintain power. Gbagbo has refused to cede power to president-elect Ouattara, who won the November 28 runoff election according to international observers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [SB 11, text] was <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/spotlight/">published</a> [text] on the Wisconsin <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/index.htm">Legislative Bureau</a> [official website] online on Friday <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixM8pc1-XREp872fFRLbVgU_MI3Q?docId=8a61f62b26c846f0ae4f0b4979c5a7a6">sparking debate</a> [AP report] among government officials as to whether the law was now in effect. Reference Bureau Director Steve Miller called the publishing a procedural step and insisted the law would not take effect until La Follette takes implementation action by publishing the law in a newspaper; however, <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=senate&district=13">Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald</a> (R) [official website] insisted the online publication meant the law would take immediate effect. La Follette said he was unclear as to the significance of the publication, but that he would not be taking any action due to the court order. In response to the online publication, two unions representing Wisconsin public works employees and firefighters, <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_bd6ad8d0-571d-11e0-8088-001cc4c002e0.html">filed a lawsuit</a> [<em>State Journal</em> report] against <a href="http://walker.wi.gov/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] alleging not enough Senate members were present when the vote on the bill was taken. <a href="http://www.local311.org/">Firefighters Local 311</a> [official website] and AFL-CIO Laborers Local 236 are seeking a judicial order declaring the bill null and void. This is the third lawsuit that has been brought challenging the controversial bill. 

<p>The Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/">Court of Appeals</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/the-wisconsin-state-court-of.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] on the order enjoining La Follette from publishing the Budget Repair Bill. The case will move on to the state Supreme Court, which will decide whether a court has the authority to enjoin the secretary of state's publication of the bill before it becomes law. Last week, <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] alleging that Republican legislators did not follow the state's <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text], a rule requiring 24 hours notice or two hours if there is an emergency, before a public meeting. A similar <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">suit</a> [complaint] was filed earlier this month by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> (D) [official profile]. On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> (R) [official website] asked the court to <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/files/Petition11CV1244.pdf">block</a> [motion, PDF] the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] order. He also asked for leave to appeal the order and for relief consisting of an order to stay the circuit court's ruling. Van Hollen argues that the Dane County Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because the four named defendants, who are all state legislators, enjoy legislative immunity during the regular legislative term. He also argued that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the publishing of the law. The provisions of the Budget Repair Bill limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since mid-February, when the bill was introduced. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law by Governor Scott Walker on March 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontwto.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The dispute settlement body of the <a href="http://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) [official website] on Friday granted Canada's request to hear its dispute of the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">EU's</a> [official website] ban on the import of seal products.  Canada <a href="http://docsonline.wto.org/imrd/directdoc.asp?DDFDocuments/t/WT/DS/369-2.doc">requested</a> [filing; DOC] establishment of a panel to hear the dispute in February.  In its request, Canada alleges that the seal ban is inconsistent with the obligations of the EU under the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/06-gatt.pdf">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994</a> and the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt.pdf">Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade</a> [text; PDF]. Specifically, Canada contends that the ban results in less favorable treatment of seal products from Canada than seal products originating from the EU, creates an unnecessary obstacle to international trade, lacks a legitimate objective and is needlessly trade restrictive even if a legitimate objective does exist. The EU has <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE72O4NE20110325?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">stated its intentions to defend its position</a> [Reuters report] in the hearing.  The EU defends the law banning seal imports as one that is consistent with its international obligations and responds to concerns by its citizens about seal products. The panel is expected to take nine months to publicly release their findings.

<p>The EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/eu-court-reinstates-ban-on-import-of-seal-products.php">reinstated the ban on import of seal products</a> [JURIST report] in October.  Representatives of Canada's Inuit population <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-inuits-sue-eu-over-seal-trade.php">sued the EU over the original ban</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010, arguing that the hunting represented a traditional aspect of the Inuit's lifestyle. The Canadian government <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2009/327.aspx">took action against the original ban</a> [press release] in November 2009, initiating the WTO dispute resolution process by requesting consultations. The original ban was implemented in September 2009 following extensive public pressure to end seal hunting by groups citing humanitarian considerations.

Pilay warned that continued repression of the Syrian people would only lead to more anger and violence. She advised the Syrian government to look to the recent events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain as examples of the futility of suppressing protests.  Pilay called for the Syrian government to guarantee protesters legitimate rights to peaceful expression and to work with the protesters to resolve their issues. Pilay expressed concern over violent repression of protests after the Syrian government announced a set of political and economic reforms stating, "Actions speak much louder than words, to announce a package of long-overdue and very welcome reforms, and then to open fire at protesters in the streets the very next day sends diametrically opposite signals and seriously undermines trust." Also on Saturday, the Syrian government <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/queensland/a/-/world/9081491/syria-frees-260-detainees-in-overture-to-protesters/">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] from Saydnaya prison in an overture to the protesters as protests in the country continued with protesters setting fire to a police station and local headquarters of the ruling Baath party. Pilay also stressed the need for an independent investigation into the death of several protesters and called for the immediate release of all detained political prisoners.   

<p>Amidst the continuing protests in the country, an adviser to Syrian President <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] on Thursday announced that the government was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">considering lifting</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency law and would work to better protect citizens' human rights. On Tuesday, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-office-concerned-over-violence-in-yemen-bahrain-syria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over violence against protesters in Syria. Earlier this month, a military court in Syria <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-military-court-jails-activist-accused-of-harming-iran-relations.php">sentenced a human rights activist</a> [JURIST report] accused of harming the country's relations with Iran to 18 months in prison. Ali Abdullah's sentence was based on allegations that he made <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jk_rIV7SptKDuJ8CnrQ2PtabM91Q?docId=6236956">critical comments against Iran</a> [AP report], thereby harming Syria's relations with a foreign country. Last month, Syria appeared to be <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">lifting the four-year-old ban</a> [JURIST report] on social media sites <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=facebook">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] as a concession to avoid <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=2&articleId=73460">popular upheaval</a> [<em>DP news</em> report]. The Syrian protests may have been inspired by the recent unrest in Egypt, where nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded during the three weeks of protests that led to the February <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://amash.house.gov/sites/amash.house.gov/files/RECLAIMAct.pdf">Restoring Essential Constitutional Constraints for Libyan Action Involving the Military (RECLAIM) Act</a> [text, PDF] cites <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag7_user.html#art1_sec8cl11">Article 1, Section 8</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the Constitution while declaring that President Barack Obama must obtain authorization before any further military action is conducted. Amash explained the legislation:<blockquote>Without approval from Congress, and absent an imminent or actual threat to our nation, the President does not have the constitutional authority to take us to war. The RECLAIM Act will enforce the constitutional requirement that Congress approve of an offensive military operation. Until the President seeks and is given authorization from Congress, air strikes in Libya must be halted. Sending our brave men and women into harm's way demands careful consideration. Whether or not Congress agrees with the President&#8217;s decision, initiating this conflict was not his decision to make alone.</blockquote>The legislation also includes a prohibition on the use of appropriated funding for military action in Libya, but recognizes the "President's inherent authority to defend the country against an attack or imminent danger of an attack."

<p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/odyssey-dawn.htm">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a US-led military operation, has been conducting air strikes against the government of Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaddafi">news archive</a>] for two weeks. The action began after the UN Security Council approved <a href="http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">Resolution 1973</a> [text] earlier this month, imposing a no-fly zone over the country. The mission, as well as US involvement absent Congressional approval, has been controversial. JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/index.php">Michael J. Kelly</a> [official profile] has argued that <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-president-does-not-need-congressional-approval-for-libya-no-fly-zone-yet.php">Obama has the constitutional authority</a> [JURIST op-ed] to conduct the operation under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [50 USC &#167; 1541 <em>et seq.</em>]. The resolution leaves Obama 92 days to act without Congressional authorization. Congress, however, reserves the right to "pull the plug," but has never before done so according to Kelly. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> [official profile] has argued that the <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">operation violates international law</a> [JURIST op-ed] by failing to comport with Article 42 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> [text], which requires a determination that "measures not involving the use of force" have failed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint names the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official websites] as defendants alleging the agencies withheld documents requested under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FOIA">news archive</a>] regarding if and how the US government and its interests affected the coup.  The complaint details the events of the 2009 coup where the Honduran military kidnapped then-president Manual Zelaya from his home and put him on a plane to Costa Rica. The complaint refers to the coup as "one of the most significant recent political events in the region" and states that the US continues to have a close relationship with Honduras, including training members of Honduran military and security forces.<blockquote>In light of the close relationship between the United States an Honduras, it is probable that little goes on in Honduras without the knowledge of, and/or consultation with, the U.S. Government. ... Despite public information regarding the U.S. Government's knowledge of the coup and its perpetrators, before and during the actual commission of the act, Defendants refuse to release and continue to unlawfully withhold documents responsive to Plaintiff's requests.</blockquote>In addition to the complaint, the CCR also <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/honduran-commission-of-truth-and-ccr-launch-effort-obtain-information-u.s.-about-2009-coup">filed several more FOIA requests</a> [press release] with the DOD and CIA on behalf of the <a href="http://www.comisiondeverdadhonduras.org/">Honduras Commission for Truth</a> (CDV) [official website], an organization tasked with investigating and establishing human rights violations that occurred during the coup.

<p>In November, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure+of+the+court/office+of+the+prosecutor/biographies/the+prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-begins-preliminary-investigations-in-honduras-and-nigeria.php">opened a preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the 2009 coup.  In July, a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/honduras-judge-drops-abuse-of-power-charges-against-ousted-leader-zelaya.php">dismissed abuse of power charges</a> against Zeleya because Zelaya's successor <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-president-pardons-military.php">granted amnesty</a> [JURIST reports] to Zeleya and those involved in his removal.

Upon ratification by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder], the proposed law will impose prison sentences and fines for strike actions and inciting protests that would negatively impact the economy.  HRW alleged that the proposed law is overbroad and vague and violates international law because it does not meet the "narrowly permitted grounds for limits on public assembly under international law" and its references to "national security" and "public safety" do not refer to situations involving an immediate and violent threat.  HRW also cited the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/pdf/ccpr.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/pdf/cescr.pdf">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (CESCR) [texts, PDF], stating that as a state party, Egypt must respect the rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. HRW criticized the law as a hindrance to democracy, "betray[ing] ... the demands of Tahrir protesters."<blockquote>Concerns about the economy or the security situation are no justification for repressive laws and no substitute for responsible policing and sound economic policies. Economic difficulties are no excuse for limiting people's rights. ... The provisions of this law criminalizing demonstrations that disrupt public works or harm societal peace are as overly broad and open to abuse as the restrictions in place under the Mubarak government. It's quite shocking, really, that a transitional government meant to replace a government ousted for its failure to respect free speech and assembly is now itself putting new restrictions on free speech and assembly.</blockquote>In order to show their respect for human rights, HRW recommended that the cabinet and military council reverse the ban, issue a public statement regarding the right to peaceful strikes and demonstrations, and end the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt+emergency">state of emergency</a> [JURIST news archive], which has been ongoing since 1981.

<p>In February, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">military council pledged to lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] once circumstances in the country improved. The council also vowed to have a peaceful transition to power and promised not to prosecute "honourable people who refused corruption and demanded for reform." Last week, a majority of Egyptian citizens <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-citizens-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-constitutional-reform.php">voted to approve constitutional reforms</a> [JURIST report], including parliamentary elections within the next six months. The council took over control of the country after former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] was forced to step down following nearly three weeks of demonstrations protesting the Egyptian government and calling for his resignation. During the three weeks of protests leading up to Mubarak's resignation, nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers for <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-personpage/kaing-guek-eav">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>] argued before the ECCC that their client was not a high-ranking member of the Khmer Rouge, but rather a person <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Defense-Calls-For-Acquittal-of-Khmer-Rouge-War-Criminal-118765439.html">merely following orders</a> [VOA report], and he should therefore be set free. In contrast, the prosecution, which will present its arguments on Tuesday, is seeking to <a href="http://www.mysinchew.com/node/55255">increase</a> [AFP report] Kaing's prison to sentence to life, but lowered to 45 years in light of time he spent in unlawful detention. Kaing, also known as "Duch," was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">convicted of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] for overseeing the torture and killing of 16,000 people. His sentence was reduced to 19 years after the court considered time served as well as other factors. In August of last year, Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-hires-new-counsel.php">hired new counsel</a> [JURIST report] to handle the appeals process. Kaing's lawyers filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/cambodia-genocide-prosecutors-to-appeal-ex-khmer-rouge-leader-sentence.php">notice of an appeal</a> [JURIST report] less than a week later. The ECCC's decision on Kaing's appeal is expected in June. 

<p>Kaing unexpectedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">asked to be released</a> [JURIST report] at the close of his trial in November 2009. His request was a complete departure from his previous conduct, as he had cooperated with the trial and repeatedly apologized to his victims and their families, mitigating conduct that earned him a reduced sentence from the 40 years prosecutors originally sought. His lawyers took different approaches in their closing remarks, with one stating that his client was not guilty and the other asking for clemency. In March 2009, Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-duch-apologizes.php">accepted responsibility and apologized</a> [JURIST report] for his conduct at the detention facility. He is the first of eight ex-Khmer Rouge officials expected to be tried before the ECCC. In April, the pre-trial chamber of the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cambodia-genocide-court-denies-bail-for.php">dismissed appeals by three other former Khmer Rouge officials</a> [JURIST report] to block the extension of their provision detention. The three prisoners, Ieng Thirith, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were arrested in November 2007 and face charges of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder, torture and religious persecution.<br />

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-553.htm">Hosanna-Tabor Church v. EEOC</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/10-553.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] and Cheryl Perich brought a claim against the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School alleging that the school had unlawfully terminated Perich in violation of the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08mark.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text] because she was diagnosed with narcolepsy. The school argues that the ADA does not apply to it because of the "ministerial exception" that allows religious organizations to give "preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion" and to "require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenants of such organization." Thus, the school believes that allowing the suit would infringe on its First Amendment right to choose its religious leaders. However, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] disagreed, <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0065p-06.pdf">finding</a> [opinion, PDF] that such an approach is "too rigid." The EEOC and Perich argue that "ministerial exception" clearly applies to ministers and religious leaders but that Perich was responsible for numerous secular teaching duties and should not be considered under the exception. Perich was terminated after she went on sick leave and attempted to return to work after obtaining a release from her doctor that said she could handle her job responsibilities while under medication. When she returned to work the school did not have a job for her and requested that she resign until the end of the year. Perich refused this situation and threatened a legal suit. The school then recommended to its board that she be terminated. Perich complained to the EEOC, which brought a discrimination and retaliation suit. 

<p>Also Monday, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032811zr.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] without comment in the <a href="http://www.troyanthonydavis.org/">Troy Anthony Davis</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=troy+davis">news archive</a>] appeal, allowing Georgia to execute Davis for a murder committed over 20 years ago. One commentator <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/davis-innocence-plea-rejected/">suggested</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that justices might have believed Davis had gotten what he wanted with a federal court review of his case, and that that decision was sufficient to resolve the matter. Last August, the US Supreme Court took the rare step of <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/supreme-court-orders-low-court-to.php">granting his original writ of <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [JURIST report] after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text] and instructed the district court to examine new findings of fact in the case. The <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] then heard the <em>habeas</em> petition, but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence. Davis was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia, police officer on the night of August 19, 1989. According to his defense lawyers, key witnesses against Davis have recanted their testimony, and others say another person has since confessed to the killing. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Excluding China, which keeps its death penalty statistics secret, the number of executions worldwide decreased from 714 in 2009 to 527 in 2010. The report further estimates that China executed "thousands" of individuals in 2010, more than the rest of the world combined. Although seven countries or territories re-instituted the death penalty after a break or expanded the scope of its current death penalty laws in 2010, fewer than half the countries that retain the death penalty have executed anyone since 2003. Salil Shetty, Secretary-General of AI, <a href="http://livewire.amnesty.org/2011/03/28/the-global-movement-to-kill-the-death-penalty/">stated</a> [AI blog]:<blockquote>Countries that insist on using the death penalty continue to claim that they use it only in accordance with international law. But most of their actions blatantly contradict these claims.

<p>In reality, many of these countries use the death penalty as a convenient way of getting rid of troublesome people and showing that authorities are tough on crime. It is often imposed after unfair trials and based on confessions extracted through torture. It is often used against political opponents, poor people, minorities and members of racial, ethnic and religious communities. It is sometimes even used against people who allegedly committed crimes when they were under 18 or who have significant mental impairments.</blockquote>Shetty argues that, for these reasons, "[a] world free of the death penalty is not only possible, it is inevitable."</p>

<p>This is the second year in a row that the number of executions has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">decreased</a> [JURIST report]. The 110 executions carried out in the US in 2010 represented only approximately a third as many as were being carried out in the mid 1990s, and Illinois became the sixteenth state to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in March.

The lawyers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/polish_investigators_of_alleged_cia_prison_ask_us_to_question_guantanamo_detainees/2011/03/28/AFt2dxnB_story.html?wprss=rss_world">submitted their request</a> [AP report], which includes a list of questions they would like the Guantanamo detainees to answer regarding their experiences, earlier this month. Both Abu Zubaydah and <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile], who is accused of bombing the USS Cole, maintain that they were detained and abused at the site, and the prosecutors believe their testimony is necessary in order to determine whether it actually exists. The <a href="http://www.soros.org">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website], a human rights group that helped to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">launch the abuse investigation</a> [JURIST report] last September, has urged the US to provide assistance. Executive Director of OSJI, James Goldston, <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/national-security/news/nashiri-rendition-20110126">stated</a> [press release] that, "[t]he United States government should swiftly respond to the Polish prosecutor's requests for information on CIA black sites. The allegations of human rights abuses associated with the CIA's illegal rendition program must be properly investigated to secure justice for the victims and prevent future misconduct." The prosecutor's request did not stipulate a deadline for response from the US.

<p>The investigation into al-Nashiri's allegations of the secret prison's existence and his abuse there began soon after former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge of a secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST report] in Poland. His denial followed confirmation by a former CIA agent that the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,717166,00.html">agency tortured</a> [Spiegel report] al-Nashiri in 2002 at a secret prison located in Poland. According to the agent, al-Nashiri was stripped naked and hooded before a gun and a drill were held close to his head. In addition to denying the existence of the prisons, Miller also stated that he believes claims of the prisons will jeopardize the safety of Polish citizens and members of the military currently serving in Afghanistan. Former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski has also denied the existence of the prisons. Both he and Miller maintain that they will not discuss the allegations of torture until the completion of an investigation into Poland's role in the US prisoner <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. The original investigation into the existence of the CIA-operated prison was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">launched by the Polish government</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision comes after a complaint was filed by opposition parliamentarians who alleged irregularities in the voting process by which Pacolli was elected. The court declared the election unconstitutional by a majority vote with two judges dissenting. The court found that the election was contrary to the requirements of Article 86 of the <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/repository/docs/Constitution.of.the.Republic.of.Kosovo.pdf">Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo</a> [text, PDF], which sets out the process for presidential elections, and "the democratic principles enshrined therein." It is uncertain whether the newly elected president must resign or if parliament will conduct another vote. The full text of the court's decision is not yet available.  

<p>This decision marks the second time Kosovo's highest court has declared circumstances surrounding the country's president unconstitutional since the country <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">declared its independence from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] three years ago. Then-president Fatmir Sejdiu <a href="http://www.president-ksgov.net/?page=2,6,1360">resigned</a> [press release] six months ago following a <a href="http://www.gjk-ks.org/?cid=2,28,193">decision</a> [press release] by the Constitutional Court that his dual roles as president and head of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kosovo-president-resigns-after-constitutional-court-ruling.php">violated the constitution</a> [JURIST report].

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-238.pdf">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] forbids states from providing publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, which are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents. In <span class="casename">McComish v. Bennett</span>, the court will determine whether Arizona's matching funds and the law regulating campaign financing to equalize resources among candidates and interest groups, rather than advancing a compelling state interest in the least restrictive manner, violate the First and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/07/02/10-15165.pdf">concluded</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Arizona public financing scheme and matching funds provision did not offend the First Amendment. The appeals court declined to reach a conclusion as to the equal protection claim. Counsel for the petitioner argued that Arizona's matching funds provision is unconstitutional and should be struck down:<blockquote>[T]his case is about whether the government can turn my act of speaking into the vehicle by which my political opponents benefit with direct government subsidies. ... This Court ... recognized that when the government reaches into a campaign and attempts to manipulate campaign financing in order to basically effectuate the outcome, that constitutes an illegitimate governmental purpose. ... The purpose of this law is to limit spending in elections and to level the playing field. ... [The law] is entirely structured to create disincentives ... on people speaking of engaging in political activity more than the government preferred.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that "public funding of elections results in more speech and more electoral competition" and furthers a governmental interest of combating "real and apparent corruption in politics." Further, that public funding combats corruption by freeing candidates from the "need to accept potentially corrupting private contributions," and allows for more candidates to run, "more political speech, and more electoral competition." Arizona's matching funds system both promoted speech and encouraged candidates to run against incumbents. The government argued, as <em>amicus curiae</em>, supporting the respondents that the matching funds provision "provides a formula for giving the publicly funded candidate as much money as the privately funded candidate." The government agreed that public financing facilitated speech and allowed candidates to run on the same footing.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-235.pdf">CSX Transportation v. McBride</a> [oral arguments transcript], the court heard arguments on whether recovery under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/45/usc_sup_01_45_10_2.html">Federal Employers' Liability Act</a> (FELA) [45 USC &#167;&#167; 51-60 text] requires proof of proximate causation. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11-23-CSX-Opinion-Below.pdf">declined to hold</a> [opinion, PDF] that common-law proximate causation is required to establish liability under FELA. Counsel for the petitioner argued that FELA was intended to follow the ordinary common law procedural approaches in respect to proximate cause:<blockquote>Just five years after the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause requirement. Proximate cause ... is an element of the cause of action. ... So proximate cause has been regarded as an essential component of the tort law. And that being so, FELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence, it creates a Federal tort law. A fundamental principle of statutory interpretation ... [is] that when Congress creates a Federal tort, it means to adopt the general background of tort law.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that the case presents a non-existent problem and that the court should adhere to the traditional approach. Counsel explained that FELA relaxed the causation standard saying, "FELA, by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of proximate cause because it limited the duty to the employee by the employer." Further, FELA is only a compensatory damages structure, providing no punitive damages, attorney's fees, or treble damages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The sentencing marks the end of an eight-year long criminal prosecution of Enron executives linked to investment fraud that caused the fall of Enron Broadband unit. Shelby was one of seven executives indicted in 2003 on more than 164 criminal counts for allegedly overstating the value of the broadband division's software and network to inflate the value of Enron's stock. Shelby, who once faced 10 years in prison, was sentenced to serving six months in confinement. As part of his plea bargain, Shelby must forfeit over two million dollars. The judge also sentenced him to nearly 250 hours of community service. Shelby is expected to start his confinement in about a week. 

<p>Several trials and appeals have delayed criminal prosecution of Enron executives over the years. Of all the those indicted, three received prison sentences, and two, including Shelby, have been given probation sentences. One executive was acquitted when his charges were dismissed at trial. In 2008, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-enron-executives-scheduled-for.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that three of Enron's CEO's be retried after an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-denies-ex-enron.php">refused to dismiss charges</a> [JURIST report] against the men.

Gao was abducted and detained in February 2009 and has been held in detention ever since. The statement alleges that Gao was not formally charged with an offense and therefore his detention has no legal basis. Furthermore, the statement alleges that Gao's family is unaware of his whereabouts, he has been denied access to a lawyer and a fair trial, and he has possibly been subjected to torture. The UN group stated that these actions are in violation of articles of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], which China has signed but not ratified. The group also submitted that Gao's detention violates articles of the <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/05/content_20813.htm">Constitution of the People's Republic of China</a> and its <a href="http://www.cecc.gov/pages/newLaws/criminalProcedureENG.php">Criminal Procedural Law</a> [text].

<p>In March 2010, an international group of human rights lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/international-lawyers-urge-un-to.php">petitioned the UN group</a> [JURIST report] to condemn Gao's detention. Two weeks later, Gao <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/missing-china-human-rights-lawyer.php">spoke to a reporter</a> [JURIST report] and verified that he was alive and living in China's Shanxi province after being missing for more than a year. Gao stated that he was released from detention, but another Chinese human rights lawyer stated that Gao still appeared to be under some form of restraint in his interview. In January 2010, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman indicated that Gao was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-official-says-missing-rights.php">"where he should be"</a> [JURIST report] and that keeping him in custody comported with the law. Gao drew international attention in September 2007 when he wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/chinese-lawyer-detained-for-sending.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to the US Congress requesting assistance in improving human rights in China. Gao, who has also defended Christians and coal miners in China, claimed that he was tortured after his arrest in 2007. Gao was originally part of the Chinese Communist Party and handled prominent cases involving the outlawed <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong movement</a> [Falun Dafa website], but fell into disfavor with the government in 2006 when he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/china-human-rights-lawyer-convicted-of.php">convicted of subversion</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest. China has long received <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+rights">criticism</a> [JURIST news archive] from watchdog groups for its treatment of rights activists such as Gao.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to judicial sources, Major General Ahmed Abu Zeid, Colonel Mohamed Abdel Maqsoud and Colonel Mohamed Othman face charges of attempted murder and murder. The charges stem from a January 28 incident where police firing in Beni Suef resulted in 19 deaths and 300 injuries. Low-ranking officials have also been indicted with the same charges. The public prosecutors requested that security force find and detain fugitive officers. Last week, Egyptian Attorney General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12841111">charged former interior minister Habib el-Adly</a> [BBC report] with "pre-meditated and deliberate killing" of protesters. He is charged with opening fire on protesters and deploying the military when protesters violently clashed with security forces on January 28.

<p>Egypt has been heavily criticized by rights groups and international organizations for its handling of protesters. On Thursday, a commission of <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">Arab and Egyptian human rights groups accused</a> [JURIST report] former president <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported new evidence that the Supreme Military Council of Egypt had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Through various detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." Also in February, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the Egyptian military was improperly <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">detaining protesters and allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report]. The report calculated at least 119 arbitrary detentions and five incidents of torture, providing detainee accounts. HRW contends that the military was targeting human rights activists, protesters and journalists. In January, UN officials including <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> and High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official websites], <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">urged the Egyptian government to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] and respect the rights of protesters. Pillay acknowledged reports of tactics including rubber-coated bullets, tear gas, water cannons and batons, and called on the government to investigate the reports of excessive force including civilian deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Berlusconi has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-court-resumes-pm-berlusconis-tax-fraud-trial.php">not attended a case hearing for more than seven years</a> [BBC report]. He is currently a defendant in four trials. Berlusconi is accused of inflating the price paid to buy television rights for his company Mediatrade to fund political activities. The appearance is a rarity for Berlusconi who has been a defendant in close to 50 trials but has consistently stayed away from the court. He stated that we will attend as many trials as he can. 

<p>Berlusconi also faces trial for <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">underage prostitution</a> [JURIST report] on April 6. In February, an Italian judge ordered Berlusconi to stand trial on charges of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of power. Berlusconi allegedly paid 7,000 euros to then 17-year-old dancer, Karima El Mahroug, for sex and later <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12083491">called police to secure her release</a> [BBC report] while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. The scandal has made Berlusconi the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/14/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSTRE71D1YN20110214">subject of protests</a> [Reuters] by hundreds of thousands of women, calling for his resignation over his recent sex scandal. Berlusconi, however, has refused to step down. Also in February, an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-court-resumes-pm-berlusconis-tax-fraud-trial.php">resumed a tax fraud case</a> [JURIST report] against Berlusconi. The case was re-opened after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">Constitutional Court modified a law</a> [JURIST report] aimed at giving Berlusconi and other public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office. That same month, Berlusconi solidified his intentions to remain in office by <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/index_2011_02_20.php#34545">pledging judicial reform</a> [JURIST report] and several other improvement he plans to make in Italy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case involved the Civil War-era <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sec_31_00003730----000-.html">False Claims Act</a> (FCA) [text], which includes provisions authorizing private citizens, dubbed qui tam relators, to sue on behalf of the US accusing federal contractors of fraudulent claims against the government. The ACLU, together with the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/">Government Accountability Project</a> (GAP) and <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/">OMB Watch</a> [advocacy websites], brought a facial constitutional challenge against the secrecy provisions of the the FCA that require the complaint to be sealed for up to 60 days so the government can decide whether to intervene and allow the government to move the court for extensions. The groups argued the provisions violate the First Amendment by infringing on the public's right of access to judicial proceedings and the qui tam relators' right to speak about their complaint, and that mandatory sealing strips the courts' inherent ability to decide whether to seal on a case-by-case basis. The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, held that, even assuming the First Amendment right of access applies to qui tam actions, the sealing provisions address a compelling government interest of protecting the integrity of such proceedings and that the provisions were narrowly tailored to address issues in modern fraud allegation claims. The court further held the FCA provisions do not intrude on judicial self-administration. One judge dissented, arguing "transparency remains central to combating waste and fraud..." and "the Government fails to justify its First Amendment infringement with compelling interests and narrow tailoring." According to the opinion, since 1986, qui tam relators have filed helped the Department of Justice return over $27 billion to the US under the FCA.

<p>Last year, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-limits-government-whistle.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-304">Graham County Soil &#38; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-false.php">report</a>] that whistleblowers cannot bring suit under the FCA to recover misspent government funds if the information used in the lawsuits came from state or local agencies' reports or audits. The suit arose out of public record documents that detailed a failure to obtain bids for the clean-up and reconstruction of storm-damaged portions of North Carolina. The ruling could potentially bar thousands of lawsuits by whistleblowers. However, Congress recently <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/03/whistle-blower-defeat-short-lived/#more-18083">changed the language of the statute</a> [SCOTUSblog report] as part of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform bill</a> [HR 3590 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in March 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thompson</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-military-funeral-protests.php">report</a>] that a district attorney cannot be held liable under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">&#167; 1983</a> [text] for a failure to train subordinates, reversing a jury award of damages for a wrongfully convicted man. The respondent was found guilty of murder when he did not testify at trial because he had earlier been convicted of armed robbery at a trial during which prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence in violation of <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/373/83/case.html">Brady v. Maryland</a> [opinion text], which requires that the state disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused. After the evidence was discovered and shortly before his scheduled execution, Thompson was found not guilty. Thompson sued district attorney Harry Connick, alleging that Connick failed to adequately train prosecutors about their duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of training had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson's robbery case. According to the statute, failure to train employees must amount to "deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact," where a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is "ordinarily necessary" to demonstrate deliberate indifference. In an opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court determined that Connick was reasonably unaware of potentially similar <span class="casename">Brady</span> violations:<blockquote>[W]hen city policymakers are on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes city employees to violate citizens' constitutional rights, the city may be deemed deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to retain that program. ... Without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.</blockquote>Furthermore, "single incident" liability is not a valid exception to the required showing of a pattern of violations. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the dissent, argued that failure to provide training in some circumstances could be so egregious such that a single violation resulting from the lack of training could be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.

<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday also <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11556.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a writ of <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-11556">Tolentino v.

Santa Clara County, CA</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that health care providers that are third-party beneficiaries of a government contract may not sue drug companies for overpricing under federal law. The issue was whether health care providers who qualify for reduced-price drugs under &#167; 340B of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00000256---b000-.html">Public Health Services Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 256b] could sue for a violation of an agreement between the federal government and drug manufacturers when they lack federal statutory authority to bring the action. Under the act, drug manufacturers must enter into contracts with the federal government that restrict the price that those manufacturers can charge to providers through the Medicaid system. The statute is silent on the topic of a private cause of action, but the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/12/15/06-16471.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that federal common law does in fact provide a cause of action under contract law where a third party beneficiary is injured by the drug manufacturer's breach. In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court rejected the Ninth Circuit's reasoning that third-party suits would spread the enforcement burden:
<blockquote>But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the interdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program. Suits by 340B entities would undermine the agency's efforts to administer these two programs harmoniously and uniformly. Notably, the Medicaid Rebate Program's statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for its drugs. Had Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely would not have barred them from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.</blockquote>The opinion stresses that the issue of inadequate enforcement authority was resolved by the Congress when it strengthened and formalized the enforcement authority of the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/index.html">Health Resources and Services Administration</a> [official website], made the new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for complaints by third-party entities and rendered the agency's resolutions of the complaints binding. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision of this case.

<p><a href="http://www.sccgov.org/portal/site/scc">Santa Clara County</a> [official website], which operates several health care providers had filed the suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical companies alleging they were overcharging the health care providers in violation of the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreements. The county was seeking compensatory damages for breach of contract. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1273.pdf">Oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] for the case were held in January. Astra <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_09_1273_Petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that only Congress can provide a cause of action under a federal statute, and that this circumvention of Congressional intent will disrupt the statutory scheme and the Medicaid system. The county <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_09_1273_Respondent.authcheckdam.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that as third-party beneficiaries, health care providers are entitled to enforce contracts and that such enforcement is necessary given the lack of oversight by the Federal government.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nokia's newest complaint alleges Apple is violating seven patents "in virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players, tablets and computers ... in the areas of multi-tasking operating systems, data synchronization, positioning, call quality and the use of Bluetooth accessories." The complaint comes in response to the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/223600/nokia_files_another_itc_complaint_against_apple_in_us.html">ITC determination that Apple did not violate the patents</a> [PC World report] involved in Nokia's <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">original complaint</a> [JURIST report] filed in October 2009. As to the ITC's decision announced on Friday, Nokia has indicated it will wait to "see the full details of the ruling before deciding on the next steps in that case." The ITC, composed of six members, is expected to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/nokia-files-second-itc-complaint-against-apple.html">decide whether it will review</a> [Bloomberg report] Friday's decision within the next two months. Nokia acknowledged that with the present complaint it now has "46 Nokia patents in suit against Apple" literally around the world.

<p>Nokia and Apple have been embroiled in litigation marked by trading accusations of patent infringement. In December, the litigation spread to Germany, the UK and the Netherlands where <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/nokia-sues-apple-in-europe-for-patent-infringement.php">Nokia filed 13 patent infringement complaints</a> [JURIST report] against Apple. Last May, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/nokia-sues-apple-for-alleged-ipad-patent-infringements.php">Nokia filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court in the Western District for Wisconsin</a> [official website] alleging that Apple iPad and iPhone 3G products infringe additional Nokia patents.

Dukes</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF], a gender discrimination class action lawsuit estimated to include more than 1.5 million women&#8212;the largest class action lawsuit in US history. The issues are (1) whether claims for monetary relief can be certified under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)</a> [text] and, if so, under what circumstances; and (2) whether the class certification ordered under rule 23(b)(2) was consistent with rule 23(a). The case was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contend that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wal-mart-appeals-class-action-certification-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court in August after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST reports] in April. Counsel for the petitioner Wal-Mart argued that the certified class failed to meet cohesion requirements because of the diverse nature of managerial discretion in the individual stores nationwide:<blockquote>The delegation of discretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive claims that are common to everyone in the class. The common policies that the plaintiffs point to are either neutral and not argued to be discriminatory or they are affirmatively nondiscriminatory. The company has a very strong policy against discrimination and in favor of diversity.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent certified class argued that although the company did not have a "formal policy of discrimination," the management staff used a common policy that was discriminatory toward women seeking advancement within the company. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-5443.pdf">Fowler v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript], the court heard arguments on whether a federal court can convict an individual of murdering a witness under the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1512.html">witness tampering statute</a> [18 USC &#167; 1512(a)(1)(C) text] without first proving that the victim provided evidence of a federal crime to authorities. The statute prohibits killing or attempting to kill a person with the intent to prevent the person from providing information about a federal crime to police or a court. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200815463.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] that Charles Fowler violated the statute by killing a police officer who had stopped Fowler and his accomplices while they were in a stolen vehicle containing drugs, had recently committed an interstate robbery and were planning a bank robbery. Fowler protested that prosecutors failed to establish that it was likely the officer would transfer information to federal investigators or that it was likely that a federal investigation would be opened. The court held, however, that prosecutors need only establish that the defendant killed the victim to prevent the communication of a possible federal offense and that they had met that burden. Counsel for the petitioner Fowler argued that the court should apply a narrower, "realistic likelihood" standard when determining if the victim would have provided information to federal authorities, rather than the government's vague, "reasonably possible" standard. Counsel for the respondent government replied that the reasonableness standard gives the jury discretion to determine whether a victim could have provided evidence to a federal agent, since it is not possible to know the "specific intent" of the deceased victim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gatete, the former Mayor of Murambi Commune in Byumba prefecture, has been <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial.php">on trial since October 2009</a> and was one of several prominent cases <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">not transferred to Rwandan authorities</a> [JURIST reports] in June 2010. He was found guilty on all charges: genocide, or, in the alternative, complicity in genocide; conspiracy to commit genocide; and the crimes against humanity of extermination, murder, and rape. It was held that Gatete both murdered, and carried out orders to rape and murder, thousands of Tutsi citizens. Minister of Justice and Attorney-General for Rwanda Tharcisse Karugarama said the <A href = "http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14580&article=39684">government was pleased with the verdict</a> [<em>New Times</em> report]. The <a href = "http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=2&mnid=2">official record will be posted</a> [case materials] on the ICTR's website in the future.

<p>As leader of the Interahamwe, a Hutu paramilitary group, Gatete was found responsible for the massacre of 6,000 Tutsis who had taken refuge in Kiziguro and Mukarange Churches, as well as ordering the widespread rape of women in the parishes. Gatete was <A href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=4737&Cr=Rwanda&Cr1=ICTR">arrested</a> [UN News Centre report] in the Republic of Congo in September 2002 and was transferred by Congolese authorities to the UN detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania. In accordance with the <a href = "http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/completionstrat/s-2009-247e.pdf">completion strategy</a> [text, PDF] of the ICTR, the prosecution requested to transfer Gatete to the national jurisdiction of Rwanda, but the request was denied in November 2008. The ICTR has received criticism for its refusal to transfer cases to Rwanda. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga <a href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9670.doc.htm">addressed</a> [press release] the <a href = "http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June and stated that the ICTR's decision not to transfer pending cases to Rwandan jurisdiction, including Gatete, undermined his country's judicial reforms and hindered national reconciliation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the vast majority of captured pirates are Somali, Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991, so prosecution and detention within the nation has been difficult.

<p>Piracy near the continent of Africa has become an increasingly serious problem for private shipowners and many nations. An increasing number of nations have been willing to prosecute pirates captured in international waters. In January, the UN Secretary-General's special adviser on maritime piracy <a href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sga1260.doc.htm">Jack Lang</a> [official profile] proposed an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/un-expert-calls-for-international-maritime-piracy-court.php">international piracy court</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, US federal courts <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/federal-court-sentences-convicted-somali-pirates-to-life.php">convicted</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/federal-court-indicts-14-suspected-pirates.php">indicted</a> [JURIST reports] two sets of Somali pirates. In February, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/malaysia-court-charges-suspected-somali-pirates.php">Malaysia</a> charged several suspected pirates [JURIST report]. A <A href = "/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">German court began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 10 suspected Somali pirates in that country's first piracy trial in 400 years in November. A <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Yemeni court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a group of 10 Somali pirates to five years in prison. Prior to these and other nations trying suspected pirates, Kenya was conducting the bulwark of piracy trials.

The order emphasizes that a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] issued March 18 prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well.

Government officials caused the state's reference bureau to <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/acts/11Act10.pdf">publish the bill</a> [Act 10 text, PDF] on Friday. Republicans claim they did not violate the restraining order because only <a href="http://www.sos.state.wi.us/">Secretary of State Doug La Follette</a> [official website] was named in the order and not the reference bureau. Some Republican legislators argue that the law went into effect Saturday. The restraining order stems from a <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/host.madison.com/content/tncms/assets/editorial/4/36/4de/4364de82-5010-11e0-8298-001cc4c002e0-revisions/4d8124a9545ca.pdf.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">report</a>] filed earlier this month by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> [official website] claiming that Republican legislators passed the bill in violation of Wisconsin's <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text] which requires 24-hour notice of public meetings in non-emergency situations. Nothing in the judge's orders prohibits the legislature from passing the law, which strictly curtails public unions' collective bargaining rights, with proper notice. State officials said they are still considering how to respond to Tuesday's order.

<p>Ozanne is the second public official to mount a legal challenge to the bill, following a <a href="http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/pdf/press/Legal_Filing.pdf">similar suit</a> [complaint, PDF] filed earlier this month by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> [official profile]. Falk's suit came immediately after Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month. The provisions limiting bargaining rights incensed unions and their supporters, sparking protests which have been ongoing since February 15, when SB 11 was introduced to address the state's $3.6 billion deficit. Earlier this month, a Wisconsin judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-orders-capitol-building-open-to-public.php">ruled that the state capitol building must remain open</a> [JURIST report] to the public during business hours, despite an attempt to close the building to protesters who had occupied it as part of a protest against the proposed restrictions on collective bargaining. The <a href="http://www.wseu-24.org/">Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24</a> [advocacy website] filed the petition earlier in the day in reaction to Walker ordering the capitol building closed and removing protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Representative Steve Montenegro sponsored <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=HB2442&Session_ID=102">HB 2442</a> and <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=HB2443&Session_ID=102">HB 2443</a> [legislative materials], which separately outlaw abortions based on the child's sex or race. Under the new abortion law, a physician or health professional who does not report known or suspected violations will face felony charges and civil fines and may be liable for damages. The bill states:<blockquote>Evidence shows that minorities are targeted for abortion and that sex-selection abortion is also occurring in our country. There is no place for such discrimination and inequality in human society. Sex-selection and race-selection abortions are elective procedures that do not in any way implicate a woman's health. The purpose of this legislation is to protect unborn children from prenatal discrimination in the form of being subjected to abortion based on the child's sex or race by prohibiting sex-selection or race-selection abortions.</blockquote>The law is set to come into effect 90 days after the end of the current legislative term.

<p>Several state legislatures have recently passed restrictions on abortions. Last week, South Dakota <a href="http://www.sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] HB 1217 into law, requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Also in March, the <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in favor of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">restricting late-term abortions </a> [JURIST report] and imposing penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. The legislation, which is slated to become effective at the end of August, bans abortions of "viable" fetuses. The <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in March to approve a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/house/">Kansas House of Representatives </a> [official website] also approved several <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">new restrictions on abortion</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Uthman's 2004 <em>habeas corpus</em> petition challenging his basis for detention was granted when the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official site] determined that the government had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Uthman had received and executed orders from al Qaeda. The appeals court rejected this "command structure test" used by the lower court and struck down the ruling, blocking Uthman's release. The appeals court found that decisions made since Uthman's petition dictate that, regarding the detention authority granted by the 2001 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-107sjres23enr/pdf/BILLS-107sjres23enr.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [S.J.RES.23 text, PDF], determinations of whether individuals are al Qaeda members must employ a functional approach on a case-by-case basis, rather than the formal approach used in Uthman's case. Examining the evidence, appeals court then found that<blockquote>Uthman's account piles coincidence upon coincidence upon coincidence. Here, as with the liable or guilty party in any civil or criminal case, it remains <em>possible</em> that Uthman was innocently going about his business and just happened to show up in a variety of extraordinary places - a kind of Forrest Gump in the war against al Qaeda. But Uthman's account at best strains credulity; and the far more likely explanation for the plethora of damning circumstantial evidence is that he was part of al Qaeda. When presented with similar circumstantial evidence in prior cases, we have had no trouble reaching the conclusion that the detainee more likely than not was part of al Qaeda...So too here.</blockquote> Uthman was captured near the Pakistan-Afghan border in December 2001 and has been held at Guantanano for over nine years. Uthman has denied the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/27-uthman-abdul-rahim-mohammed-uthman/">claims made against him</a> [NYT backgrounder] as listed by the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/combatant_Tribunals.html">Combat Status Review Tribunal and the Administrative Review Board</a> [official site] that reviewed his case.

<p>Federal courts have struggled with <em>habeas corpus</em> rights for Guantanamo detainees. In September, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Al-Odah-cert-petition-9-28-10.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief. The DC appeals court <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201007/09-5331-1253722.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">report</a>] <em>habeas corpus</em> relief to al Odah in July. The court affirmed the district court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-639">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-denies-al-odah-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that there was sufficient evidence against al Odah for him to be considered "part of" al Qaeda and Taliban forces. In August, the DC district court released a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1254-907">partially redacted opinion</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-orders-release-of-guantanamo-detainee-for-lack-of-evidence.php">ordering the release</a> [JURIST report] of Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/156-allal-ab-aljallil-abd-al-rahman/documents/8/pages/879#36">Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif</a> [NYT profile] for lack of evidence.</p>

Last month, the court granted Wilders the right to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12456693">set out the objections</a> [BBC report] he had made during the initial trial, which was postponed following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-dismisses-judges-for-bias-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">dismissal of the original panel of judges</a> [JURIST report] amidst allegations of bias. However, this panel <a href="http://www.660worl.com/article.aspx?id=4c0e743a-6c58-456b-9fee-d7df2a79cc65&catid=0">rejected Wilders' objections</a> [AP report], ruling that the Amsterdam court has the authority to judge the case, given that the alleged statements, which constitute the offenses with which Wilders is charged, were committed within its jurisdiction. Wilders is alleged to have made inflammatory remarks against Islam. In one statement, he purportedly called the religion "fascist" and compared the Koran to Hitler's book <u>Mein Kampf</u>. While the court will allow prosecution to continue for any statements Wilders made likening Islam to Nazism, it dropped a complaint against him for referring to the Koran itself as "fascist," holding that prosecutors were precluded from including statements comparing Islam to fascism alone. Wilders maintains that his remarks were made as part of a legitimate political debate and are protected by his right to free speech. Wilders trial is scheduled to continue on April 13, with expectations for a verdict in June. He faces up to one year in prison, but it is more likely that he will be fined if found guilty.

<p>The case against Wilders has suffered a number of setbacks. Prior to their dismissal, the original panel members heard the prosecution's case, which culminated in a request that Wilders be <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-prosecutor-requests-politicians-acquittal-for-anti-islamic-statements.php">acquitted on all charges</a> [JURIST report]. The prosecutors based their request on determinations that the politician's statements were directed at Islam and not Muslims themselves and additionally, that the evidence failed to establish that he intended to incite violence. The presentment of the prosecution's case followed an order from a panel of Dutch judges to resume the trial after initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-rejects-bias-allegations-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">rejecting claims of judicial bias</a> [JURIST report]. The trial had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-politicians-trial-suspended-soon-after-it-begins.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] after a lawyer representing Wilders accused one of the judges of making a statement which cast him in an unfavorable light to the jury. Wilders has consistently been an outspoken opponent of immigration, especially that of Muslims, previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">announcing</a> [JURIST report] that he would support the current Dutch cabinet in exchange for promises to legislate a curtailment on immigration and a ban on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and other full Islamic veils.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0052p-06.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a previous <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] ruling that the state commission did have that power. The dispute centers on whether so-called "entrance facilities may function as interconnectivity junctions to the incumbent network. The FCC, in a prior order, had ruled that entrance facilities need not be provided to competitors at cost, but that interconnectivity facilities must be provided at cost. Petitioners' argument centers on the plain meaning of the terms, that an entrance facility can be used to link two networks for interconnectivity, and deference to the FCC, which also filed an <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/previewbriefs/10_313_brief_updates/10-313_PetitionerAmCuUnitedStates.authcheckdam.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF] with the court. 

<p>In the consolidated cases <span class="casename">Actavis Elizabeth, LLC v. Mensing</span>, <span class="casename">Actavis v. Demahy</span> and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-993.pdf">PLIVA v. Mensing</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether generic drug manufacturers can be held liable for not including more information on a label than mandated by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website]. In the opinion below, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C08/08-31204-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that, just as claims against manufacturers of name-brand drugs are not preempted by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/federalfooddrugandcosmeticactfdcact/default.htm">Food Drug and Cosmetic Act</a> (FDCA) [materials], claims against manufacturers of generic drugs are similarly not preempted. Petitioners argue mainly that the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/FDCActChapterVDrugsandDevices/ucm108125.htm">Hatch-Waxman Act</a> [21 USC &#167; 355] mandates that generic drugs be labeled with the same warnings as name-brand drugs, and thus they cannot be held liable at the state level for a federally-imposed conformity. Because this is an untenable situation, Petitioners argue that federal preemption should apply, and attempted to distinguish this case from the court's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-rules-state-law-not.php">Wyeth v. Levine</a> [JURIST report], by saying that, unlike generics, manufacturers of name-brand drugs had the "ability, had the obligation, to ... actually change the label."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The document vests the military council with <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8953/Egypt/Politics-/Armed-Forces-announces-Egypts-interim-Constitution.aspx">presidential powers</a> [<em>Al-Ahram</em> report], including the abilities to introduce legislation, veto existing laws and act as Egypt's representative to the international community. Among the constitution's 62 articles, nine of which were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-citizens-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-constitutional-reform.php">popularly approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, are provisions mandating presidential term limits, vice presidential appointments, judicial oversight of elections and the formulation of a 100-member committee to be charged with <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5glZbmoCOVd18LIdB2kmz5WhBQppA?docId=aa84adb1dfe143ed8b5092fb9fc276a7">drafting a permanent replacement constitution</a> [AP report] that will then be submitted for approval via referendum. Several aspects from the preceding constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-suspends-constitution-schedules-elections.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in February, are continued in the interim version, namely the retention of Islamic <a href="http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia+law">news archive</a>] and of Islam as the national religion.

<p>The military council announced earlier this week that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-to-lift-state-of-emergency-before-september-election.php">lift the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] prior to the September parliamentary elections, and that requirements for the registration of political parties have been lessened.

The FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/1023136/110330googlebuzzcmpt.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleges that when Google launched Buzz through its web-based email, Gmail, users were automatically enrolled without their consent and were unable to decline or leave the social network and that the Buzz privacy controls were confusing. The FTC also charged Google with asserting false claims to the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/">Department of Commerce</a> [official website] that it was adhering to the substantive privacy requirements of the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018493.asp">US-EU Safe Harbor Framework</a> [materials]. Under the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/1023136/110330googlebuzzagreeorder.pdf">proposed settlement</a> [text, PDF], Google must obtain users' consent before sharing their information with third parties or using it in any of its new products or services. Google must also establish a comprehensive privacy program and submit to regular, independent audits of its privacy and data protection practices for the next 20 years. Google is further prohibited from misrepresenting its privacy and confidentiality policies to consumers or its compliance with privacy and security programs. If Google fails to comply with the settlement, it may be subject to a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110330/wr_nm/us_ftc_google_buzz">$16,000 fine per violation</a> [Reuters report]. FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/commissioners/leibowitz/index.shtml">Chairman Jon Leibowitz</a> [official profile] said:<blockquote>When companies make privacy pledges, they need to honor them. This is a tough settlement that ensures that Google will honor its commitments to consumers and build strong privacy protections into all of its operations.</blockquote>Google Director of Privacy, Product &#38; Engineering Alma Whitten <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/update-on-buzz.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28Official+Google+Blog%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">apologized</a> [text] and expressed the company's commitment to ensuring individual privacy. Google previously reached a <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/sa.pdf">settlement</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-announces-settlement-in-buzz-privacy-class-action-lawsuit.php">report</a>] in a class action lawsuit in response to a <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleging that the Buzz application exposed private user data, including contact lists, to other Gmail users. Under the earlier settlement, Google will place $8.5 million dollars into a common fund to distribute to organizations that provide education regarding Internet privacy. Google stressed that the settlement did not mean that the company was admitting liability for the privacy breach and that the company has since resolved all privacy issues with the Buzz application.

<p>Google has recently faced a number of allegations of violating privacy laws, both in the US and abroad. In November, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] confirmed that it is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fcc-investigating-google-for-street-view-privacy-breach.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Google to determine if it violated communications laws when its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=street+view">Street View</a> [JURIST news archive] vehicles inadvertently collected private user data, including passwords and URLs, over WiFi networks. In October, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's data collection through Street View cars after Google assured the FTC that it did not use any of the collected data and announced that it was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/creating-stronger-privacy-controls.html">committed to compliance with privacy laws</a> [text], instituting new training on privacy principles and appointing a new director of privacy. In addition to investigations within the FCC and the FTC, Google has come under investigation for privacy breaches relating to its Street View program in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">UK</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-commission-fines-google-for-violating-data-privacy-laws.php">France</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">Canada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">South Korea</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports]. Most recently, a Berlin court <a href="http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/senatsverwaltungen/justiz/kammergericht/presse/37_o_363_10_landgericht_berlin_urteil_vom_13.9.2010_anonymisiert.pdf?start&ts=1300200478&file=37_o_363_10_landgericht_berlin_urteil_vom_13.9.2010_anonymisiert.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, in German; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">report</a>] that Google Street View is legal in Germany. The ruling was narrowly focused on property rights and did not address larger data protection issues the company is currently confronting. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In continuing its membership, the US intends to further its stand against the council's "biased and disproportional focus on Israel," and push the council to "address a broad range of urgent and serious human rights concerns worldwide." The State Department highlighted the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/03/159343.htm">accomplishments</a> [fact sheet] of the UNHRC over the last two years, citing the council's deepened engagement in human rights situations worldwide, initiation of concrete action to drive human rights priorities, and defense of core human rights principles. State Department Acting Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner expressed the US government's commitment to human rights, saying:<blockquote>We believe that US engagement in the Human Rights Council has directly resulted in real progress. In our two years on the Council, we've not been happy with every outcome, and have firmly denounced Council actions we disagree with, but the Council has made important strides. Much work remains to be done for the Human Rights Council to sustain the gains of the last two years and to fully realize its potential, and the United States looks forward to continuing our efforts to do so.</blockquote>Last week's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10897&LangID=E">16th session of the UNHRC</a> [press release] adopted 40 resolutions promoting human rights, appointed a Special Rapporteur to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-council-launches-iran-probe.php">assess the human rights situation in Iran</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-human-rights-council-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses-in-ivory-coast.php'">dispatched an independent commission to the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST reports] to investigate the violation of human rights following the presidential elections. Also, the US led an unprecedented effort to have 85 member-states sign on to a statement supporting the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people.

<p>The US was among 18 countries <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-elected-to-seat-on-un-rights-council.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] to the council in May 2009. When the US <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-takes-seat-on-un-rights-council.php">first took its place</a> [JURIST report] on the UNHRC, the Obama administration faced <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42341031/">opposition</a> [Reuters report] from pro-Israel groups. Several other human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/groups-urge-competitive-elections-in-un.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the council's election process, alleging vote trading and a lack of effective candidates. In April 2009, the State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-releases-human-rights-pledges-in.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its commitments and pledges to human rights in anticipation of May election. The US announced its intent to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/us-to-seek-un-human-rights-council-seat.php">seek a seat on the council</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month, hoping to affect more change by working from inside the council than by boycotting the effort. The UNHRC was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-un-approves-human-rights.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 to replace the much-criticized Committee on Human Rights, at which time the Bush administration declined to seek a council seat or participate in its proceedings due to a perceived anti-Israeli sentiment by the UNHRC. The US's current term on the council will expire in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that paragraphs 3 and 4 of &#167; 97 of the <a href="http://www.mpo.cz/dokument75810.html">Electronic Communications Act</a> [official materials], which compelled telecommunications companies to keep records of their customers' calls, faxes, text messages, internet activity, and emails for up to 12 months, are <a href="http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/GetFile?id=5075">unconstitutional</a> [text, PDF, in Czech]. The Czech law stems from a European Union <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF">directive</a> [text, PDF] requiring member states to gather telecommunications data in an effort to combat terrorism and organized crime. The retained data at issue was <a href="http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-const-court-cancels-storage-of-data-on-all-e-mails-calls/617125">not the actual content of the communications</a> [CNA report], but rather information showing when and with whom people were communicating. </p>

<p>The balancing of telecommunications monitoring for security purposes and privacy concerns has been a struggle post 9/11 in both Europe and the US. Last year, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-high-court-overturns-data.php">overturned a law</a> [JURIST report] that required telecommunications providers to store information on telephone calls, e-mails, and Internet use for six months for use in possible terrorism investigations, citing privacy issues. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-foia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] are not required to confirm or deny the existence of electronic surveillance records under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. In April 2009, the DOJ announced that it had <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/04/doj-limits-nsa-surveillance-after.php">limited</a> [JURIST report] the NSA's electronic surveillance, but maintained that the information being received was still important. In 2006, it was revealed that the NSA was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/nsa-collected-millions-of-us-phone.php">collecting phone records</a> [JURIST report] was from major telephone companies to study the calling patterns of millions of Americans in an effort to detect terrorist activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morris Davis</a> [official profile, PDF] can proceed. Davis, who was employed at the LOC's <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/">Congressional Research Service</a> (CRS) [official website], resigned as the military commissions' chief prosecutor in October 2007. Following his resignation, Davis became an outspoken critic of the commissions, writing articles, giving speeches and testifying before Congress that the system is fundamentally flawed. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/aclu-files-suit-against-library-of.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] last January, alleging that the LOC violated Davis' <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/">First</a> and <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [texts] rights when it terminated him after he authored a high-profile piece <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574525581723576284.html">criticizing the military commission system</a> [text] for the <a href="http://online.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> [official website]. Observing that Davis' complaint articulated legitimate First and Fifth Amendment claims, Judge Reggie Walton denied motions by <a href="http://www.loc.gov/bicentennial/bios/preserve/billington.html">Librarian of Congress James Billington</a> [official website] and CRS Director Daniel Mulhollan to dismiss and to stay litigation. Aden Fine, staff attorney with the ACLU Speech Privacy and Technology Project, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/court-rules-aclu-lawsuit-behalf-former-gitmo-prosecutor-fired-library-congress-can-move-">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release], saying "[i]ndividuals do not surrender their First Amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest when they become public employees." 

<p>Davis drew attention to the alleged iniquities of the military commissions system in 2007, when he penned a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/opinion/26davis.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all">noted op-ed</a> [text] for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> [official website] about his experience as chief prosecutor. Later that year, Davis publicly said that he was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">pressured to use classified evidence</a> [JURIST report] against defendants while heading serving as chief prosecutor at Guantanamo. He further claimed that the push to use classified evidence stemmed from certain military officials' desire to keep the trials closed and complained that <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile], legal adviser to the <a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/legal-matters/ucmj-convening-authority">Convening Authority</a> [official backgrounder] for the trials, should not have been supervising his work. The issue played a role in his <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/top-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision allowing a challenge to the country's anti-prostitution laws. The appeals court had <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/CA/10/04/2010BCCA0439.htm">set aside</a> a <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2008/2008bcsc1726/2008bcsc1726.html">lower court ruling</a> [judgments] denying standing to Sheryl Kiselbach, a former sex worker in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, and the federal attorney general appealed. Kiselbach filed the challenge in 2007, along with Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence in Society. Kiselbach's lawyer contends that denying standing would <a href="http://www.thespec.com/news/canada/article/510443--new-hurdle-for-sex-worker-striving-to-get-canada-s-prostitution-laws-tossed">erase 30 years of abuse and prosecution</a> [CP report] suffered by Kiselbach, who allegedly left the sex trade to overhaul Canada's anti-prostitution laws.  

<p>In September, the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">struck down</a> several provisions of Canada's anti-prostitution laws, citing the danger they generate for sex workers, but a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ontario-court-extends-stay-for-prostitution-laws.php">stay was issued</a> [JURIST reports] pending appeal. That suit was also launched in 2007 by the <a href="http://spoc.ca/">Sex Professionals of Canada</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/canada-sex-workers-to-challenge.php">challenging three provisions</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/">Canadian Criminal Code</a> [text] as inconsistent with the Canadian <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Charter/index.html">Charter of Rights and Freedom</a> [text]. While prostitution itself is not illegal in Canada, <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-146.html#h-70">&#167; 210</a>,  <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-147.html#h-71">&#167; 212</a> and  <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-148.html#h-72">&#167; 213</a> of the Criminal Code prohibits the keeping of "common bawdy houses," engaging in communications for the purpose of soliciting sex and living "on the avails" of the sex trade. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was approved in the Senate by a vote of 17 to 16, shortly after a House <a href = "http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/votes.cfm?ID=129_SB_5">vote of 53 to 44</a> [unofficial votes]. In February, the legislation was protested by <a href = "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/02/hundreds_descend_on_ohio_state.html">4,000 union members</a> [<em>The Plain Dealer</em> report] at the Ohio capitol building marking the largest union-backed protest in over a decade. A <a href = "http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/analysis.cfm?ID=129_SB_5&ACT=As%20Enrolled&hf=analyses129/s0005-rh-129.htm">summary of the bill</a> [text] details that unions can only collectively bargain for wages and equipment for personal safety and that public employees cannot strike. Additionally, the bill allows a union to be decertified with a petition signed by 30 percent of members as opposed to the prior standard of 50 percent and requires most state employees to be paid based on performance. Furthermore, Senate Bill 5 creates a ban on nonunion members paying any part of union dues and takes away any benefits from seniority. The <a href = "http://ohiodems.org">Ohio Democratic Party</a> [advocacy website] and union leaders are attempting to create a <a href = "http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/03/31/copy/assembly-sends-sb-5-to-kasich.html?adsec=politics&sid=101">public referendum to repeal the law</a> [<em>The Columbus Dispatch</em> report]. To do this, they will need a petition with 230,000 signatories within 90 days of the bill being signed. <a href = "http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill on Friday afternoon.

<p>Ohio is the most recent in a string of anti-union laws sweeping the US. Yesterday, the New Hampshire <a href = "http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed an amendment to their current budget that would require <a href = "http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2011/03/30/nh_house_approves_anti_union_proposal/">public employees to make concessions automatically</a> [AP report] or become at-will employees. Earlier this month Wisconsin <a href = "http://walker.wi.gov/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that limits the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees. The law is currently enjoined, but legislators have <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-union-bargaining-bill-may-become-law-despite-judicial-order.php">gone forward with publishing it</a> [JURIST report], a step toward the law's enforcement, despite judicial concern. Indiana Democrats <a href = "http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011103290334">defeated an anti-union bill</a> [<em>Indiana Star</em> report] by fleeing the state until the bill missed a procedural deadline. Legislation is <a href = "http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/new-nebraska-legislation-proposes-limiting-unions-power-1.2479887">pending in Nebraska</a> [<em>Daily Nebraskan</em> report] to prohibit state employee collective bargaining and to dismantle the <a href = "http://www.ncir.ne.gov/">Commission of Industrial Relations</a> (CIR) [official website], a non-partisan arbiter in state labor disputes. Measures limiting unions are also in committees in Michigan, Tennessee, and Florida.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that no abuse of discretion had occurred, citing the broad discretion which must be afforded to a government agency's interpretations of its own regulations as its reason for upholding the EPA's decision. A coalition of environmental groups, including the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org">National Resource Defense Council</a> [official website], originally filed suit alleging the EPA's determinations were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the law because the EPA failed to consider attainment demonstrations of the approved limitations. The coalition was concerned that the caps did not adequately address the issues of air pollution faced by people living in close proximity to California highways. The EPA made the determination of the adequacy of the emissions limits as part of the approval process for a broader state implementation plan relating to transportation. It is unclear whether the coalition will petition the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] for review. 

<p>This case stems from the controversial ability of the EPA to control the regulation of greenhouse gases. Last year, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] defeated a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.Res.26:">resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">report</a>] aimed at limiting the ability of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> [materials]. The US Supreme Court affirmed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act in its 2007 ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/05-1120">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">report</a>]. In its ruling, the court held that if the EPA could show a link between greenhouse gas emissions and public health and welfare, then the act gives it the power to regulate emissions. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">announced last December</a> [JURIST report] that it had found that greenhouse gases "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution.<br />

The panel will be composed of legal experts and charged with examining <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110331/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_syria_157">potential legislative measures</a> [AP report] that would simultaneously preserve national security and allow the revocation of the emergency law, which permits arrest without charge and bans political protests. The announcement may be an effort to appease demonstrators, whose activity has increased in recent weeks, while also conveying that any forthcoming reforms will proceed at a gradual pace. The committee is expected to complete its report by April 25.

<p>Al-Assad announced last week that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">consider ending the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country last week, the government <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/queensland/a/-/world/9081491/syria-frees-260-detainees-in-overture-to-protesters/">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters. Last month, Syria appeared to be <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">lifting the four-year-old ban</a> [JURIST report] on social media sites <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=facebook">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] as a concession to avoid <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=2&articleId=73460">popular upheaval</a> [DP report]. The Syrian protests may have been inspired by the recent unrest in Egypt, where nearly 400 people were killed and 5,500 were wounded during three weeks of protests that led to the February <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Microsoft to file anti-competition complaint against Google</title>

Microsoft claims Google has engaged in "a broadening pattern of conduct aimed at stopping anyone else from creating a competitive alternative" to Google's products and services in Europe, where it controls over 90 percent of the search market. Among the "concerns" cited by Microsoft are Google's technical restrictions on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/about_youtube">YouTube</a> [corporate website], acquired by the search giant in 2006. Some restrictions prevent competing search engines from properly accessing the site for search results, and others deny permission for Microsoft's Windows Phones to operate properly with YouTube while allowing Google's own Android phones and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] iPhones full access. Microsoft also points to Google's plan for exclusive access by its search engine to the fruits of Google's massive and controversial <a href="http://books.google.com/">book-scanning initiative</a> [Google Book Search website], as well as contractual prohibitions place by Google on advertisers and leading Web sites in Europe. Finally, Microsoft claims that Google discriminates against potential competitors through algorithmic promotion or demotion of various advertisements, making it more costly to attain prominent placement for those ads.

<p>Google has been facing an ongoing <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/eu-announces-antitrust-probe-into-google-business-practices.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] by the EC over allegations of manipulation of search results to highlight Google's own products and services. The company has faced separate antitrust inquiries in Italy, Germany and France in addition to the EC probe, in which Microsoft-owned Bing subsidiary Caio was one of the original complainants. Microsoft's Wednesday announcement of a formal complaint against Google came the same day the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">announced a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the company over charges that it breached consumer privacy rights and was misleading during the launch of its social networking platform, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fbuzz&rct=j&q=google%20buzz&ei=btqTTc2wKc2w0QHG6KXtCw&usg=AFQjCNE5QU31p84R7FkQ4QEOe2di_wV9iQ&sig2=rp87cHBEvCKfnrYY1b6xcA&cad=rja">Google Buzz</a> [website]. These reports come on the heels of last week's New York court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">rejecting a proposed settlement</a> [JURIST report] in the 2005 suit brought by authors and publishers over the Google Book Search project. Additionally, in October Canadian Privacy Commissioner <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/index_e.cfm">Jennifer Stoddart</a> [official website] announced that Google had <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-privacy-commissioner-finds-google-breached-privacy-laws.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF] by unintentionally capturing personal information while taking pictures for its <a href = "http://maps.google.com/intl/en_ca/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View feature</a> [website]. Investigations were also initiated in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-privacy-commissioner-says-google-violated-privacy-laws.php">Australia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">South Korea</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-launches-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>
