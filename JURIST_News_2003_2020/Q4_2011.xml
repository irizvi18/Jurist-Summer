The memorandum, released by Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness <a href="http://prhome.defense.gov/bios/cliffordStanley.aspx">Dr. Clifford Stanley</a> [official profile] further provides that chaplains can perform a ceremony either on or off military property as long as it complies with state and local laws. Chaplains are also not required to participate or officiate if it "would be in variance with the tenets of his or her religion or personal beliefs." The <a href="http://www.sldn.org/">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a> (SLDN) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.sldn.org/news/archives/sldn-statement-on-department-of-defense-guidance-on-chaplains-facilities/">applauded</a> [statement] the DOD's decision:<blockquote>The guidance issued today strikes the right balance between respecting the faith traditions of chaplains and affording all service members the same rights under current law. This is another logical step in the direction of full equality for gay and lesbian service members, and we hope the Department will continue to move down that path.</blockquote>The SLDN also voiced its support for another decision <a href="http://www2.advocate.com/pdfs/FacilitiesMemo.pdf">issued</a> [text, PDF] earlier in September providing that all determinations regarding the use of DOD facilities will be made  on a sexual-orientation neutral basis.

<p>The announcement regarding same-sex ceremonies comes just 10 days after the repeal of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/dadt/">backgrounder</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">officially went into effect</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ninth-circuit-vacates-dont-ask-dont-tell-ruling.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a district court ruling that DADT was a violation of service members' constitutional rights, holding that the case became moot after the repeal. In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">would remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its newly-scheduled repeal. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">effectively reiterated its order</a> [JURIST report] issued the previous week, in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certified DADT's repeal</a> [JURIST report], scheduling the policy to end on September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-member commission of inquiry was established by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in September after <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-reports-syria-death-toll-at-2600.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that at least 2,600 people were killed in the country as a result of its crackdown on anti-government protesters. Brazilian diplomat <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_27367.html">Paulo Sergio Pinheiro</a> [UNICEF profile], who is heading the commission, stated that the commission wants to start its investigation as soon as possible. Pinheiro said that the investigation is in the best interest of the UN as well as Syrian authorities and expressed hope that permission would be granted before <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=upr">universal periodic review</a> [JURIST news archive] exercises begin at the end of this week.

<p>In August, Pillay called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">investigate the violent suppression of anti-government protests</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay's remarks came after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published its 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the HRC in April but was not permitted to enter the country. Also last month, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. In July, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In July, Seselj alleged that he was being denied "speedy process," as he has been in custody since February 2003, and that the ICTY had denied him the right to defend himself by not fully funding his defense. Seselj made <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10816">similar claims in 2009</a> [press release], which were also refuted by the court under the same reasoning.<blockquote>The Chamber further recalls that in its Decision of 10 February 2010, rejecting the Motion of the Accused for abuse of process, she stressed that the international and European case law clearly establishes that there is no set time limit beyond which would be considered an unfair trial because of an excessive delay.</BLOCKQUOTE>The decision also stated that Seselj's trial has been ongoing since his last motion was decided in February 2010, without any notable delay. A status conference on Seselj's case is expected later this month.

<p>Seselj <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/icty-defendant-seselj-pleads-not-guilty-to-contempt-charges-over-revealing-confidential-information-.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July to a third set of contempt charges for failing to remove confidential information from his website in violation of a tribunal order. The Trial Chamber filed an order in lieu of an indictment in May against Seselj for his failure to comply with a May 9 order to remove from his website <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=10">three books he authored</a> and five <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=11">confidential filings</a> [defense website] that reveal the identities of protected witnesses who testified against him. In May, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icty-allows-seselj-war-crimes-trial-to-continue.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Seselj's attempt to have the charges against him dismissed, finding sufficient evidence for the trial to continue. He is charged with 14 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. Seselj's war crimes trial, which began in 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/icty-resumes-seselj-trial-after-delay.php">resumed in early 2010</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">being delayed</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly a year over fears that witnesses were being intimidated. In February, Seselj <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-begins-contempt-trial-over-witness-identity-revelations.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he released the names of 11 ICTY witnesses in violation of a confidentiality order. Last May, the ICTY appeals division <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-upholds-contempt-conviction-of-serb-nationalist-leader.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">2009 contempt verdict</a> [JURIST reports] against Seselj for revealing the identities of other witnesses that were supposed to remain confidential. Seselj is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Spokesperson Rupert Colville made the comment in reaction to the <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=28&nav_id=76608">recent death of Agim Zogaj</a> [B92 report], a major witness for the prosecution against senior Kosovo politician and parliamentarian Fatmir Limaj. Limaj, a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), is awaiting trial on charges of war crimes stemming from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-99 Kosovo war with Serbia</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kosovo+War">news archive</a>]. Zogaj, known as Witness X, was a KLA member under Limaj's direct command during the alleged <a href = "http://www.balkanpeace.org/index.php?index=/content/testimonies/wctk/wctk07.incl">Klecka massacre</a> [Centre for Peace in the Balkans backgrounder]. Although authorities are still investigating, Zogaj's death has been tentatively ruled a suicide.<blockquote>While the exact reasons behind his apparent suicide are difficult to ascertain, this case adds to our longstanding concerns about witness protection in Kosovo. We call for an effective and independent witness and victim protection system inside Kosovo to be put in place. Only an effective and well-resourced witness and victim protection system in Kosovo will help render justice to the victims and end impunity regarding past violations.</blockquote>Since Zogaj's death, at least <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=29&nav_id=76621">one witness has decided not to testify</a> [B92 report]. The <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website] has not commented on how severely this affects their case against Limaj and nine others, nor if it will delay the trial, which was expected to begin this month.

<p>An EU judge in September placed <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/eu-judge-places-senior-kosovo-politician-under-house-arrest-on-suspicion-of-war-crimes.php">Limaj under house arrest for one month</a> [JURIST report] while awaiting trial, acting on a request by EULEX prosecutors. Limaj allegedly ordered two captured Serb policemen and executed and tortured another Serbian captive in 1999. Limaj is also under investigation for embezzling funds while serving as transport minister. Limaj and the KLA, despite allegations of human rights violations, are viewed as liberators by many ethnic Albanians. In 2005, Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. EULEX has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008. Kosovo controversially <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">seceded from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008, and its new constitution <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] later that year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the journalism rights group, <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website], the discovery on September 24 of the body of Maria Elizabeth Macias, editor of <em>Primera Hora</em>, marked the fourth woman journalist to be murdered in Mexico this year as well as the <a href="http://en.rsf.org/mexico-woman-newspaper-editor-beheaded-in-26-09-2011,41057.html">eightieth journalist to be killed</a> [press release] in the country within the last decade. The death of Macias is believed to be the result of her online blogging activity, which covered organized crime in her neighborhood. OHCHR spokersperson Rupert Colville <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11455&LangID=E">said</a> [press briefing]:<blockquote>We urge the Mexican authorities to launch immediate full and impartial investigations into these events. We also remind them of their obligation to protect all people in Mexico from the threats to the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, particularly their right to life, to security and integrity of the person, and to freedom of expression.</blockquote>He noted that the killings illustrate the "deteriorating situation of freedom of expression in the country."

<p>In May, RSF released its <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/middle-east-leaders-among-annual-list-of-threats-to-press-freedom.php">annual list of predators of press freedom</a> [JURIST report], which included the heads of state of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Mexican drug cartels. The list was composed of 38 world leaders and organizations, including Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile], Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile, and Yemeni <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic], whose countries have been engulfed in the recent wave of protests across the region. Other predators of press freedom include Spain's ETA, the government of Iran and the government of China. In April, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] released its 2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices [materials]. The reports <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">cited many of the same leaders and organizations</a> [JURIST report] for violating freedom of the press. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, the National Safety Court of Appeal, a court composed of military prosecutors and civilian and military judges, in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain">Bahrain</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] one anti-government protester to death for killing a police officer and gave lengthy prison sentences to medical personnel, including doctors, for providing treatment to injured protesters during the country's uprising. In a <a href="http://www.bahrainjdm.org/?p=818">statement</a> [text] released shortly after the convictions, the medics denounced the charges and criticized the Bahraini government:<blockquote>During the times of unrest in Bahrain, we honored our medical oath to treat the wounded and save lives. And as a result, we are being rewarded with unjust and harsh sentences. ... The charges that we have being accused of are absolutely ludicrous. We are highly professional and experienced medics and specialists, and we categorically deny all charges against us. This is the first time in the history of medicine that the medical profession has been attacked on such a large scale by any government.</blockquote>Numerous human rights groups have also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmrt4GxMeTcQsyz_g6_d-EZ7noPQ?docId=6711ba3e5d434950a0e13de9dad1605f">voiced concern over the convictions</a> [AP report], while Bahraini officials maintain that the medics "actively supported opposition protestors."

<p>Forty-seven doctors and nurses were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-doctors-nurses-on-trial-for-treating-injured-protesters.php">arraigned</a> [JURIST report] in June on charges of trying to overthrow the government and participating in illegal demonstrations when they helped treat injured protesters at the <a href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website], a state-run center in Bahrain's capital, Manama. Human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites], in April, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Bahrain for rampant human rights abuses related to anti-government protests. In March, six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Bahrain after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in Manama. Days earlier, Bahraini King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared a three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Also in March, the member states of the GCC, which includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786">deployed troops to Bahrain</a> [BBC report] for the purpose of guarding oil installations and financial institutions. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During a speech given at the 15th annual dinner hosted by equal rights group <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website], Obama told the audience that DOMA "runs counter to the Constitution, and it's time for it to end once and for all," and that his administration was no longer defending the legislation. The president called on equal rights advocates to continue fighting for equality and acknowledged that progress would take time:<blockquote>I don't have to tell you how many are still denied their basic rights&#8212;Americans who are still made to feel like second-class citizens, who have to live a lie to keep their jobs, or who are afraid to walk the street, or down the hall at school. Many of you have devoted your lives to the cause of equality. So you know what we have to do; we've got more work ahead of us.</blockquote>Finally, Obama discussed a number of other measures his administration has implemented in an effort to "fight for equality," including the recent repeal of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">took effect on September 20</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced at a White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/19/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-7192011">press briefing</a> [text] in July that Obama supports the repeal of DOMA. Carney also said that Obama supports the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced by Congressional Democrats</a> [JURIST report] in February to repeal DOMA, the 1996 federal law that defines marriage as "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife." In March, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he was launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution." Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act following February's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA, which restricts the federal definition of marriage to heterosexual couples, in court cases challenging the provision. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a July 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. Currently DOMA allows other states to ignore those recognized same-sex marriages, and prevents same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits available to married couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ocampo has been asked to report any information collected pertaining to the allegations between the years 2002-2010. He alleges that <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/F9AF01D6-28E5-4533-9398-3F4B616BB7DB.htm">thousands have been killed</a> [ICC press release] and hundreds detained and raped in the months-long struggle between ousted leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] and rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] after Gbagbo refused to give up power. This will be Ocampo's seventh inquiry into African conflicts and the first investigation into a state not party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [official website].

<p>Ocampo officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-requests-permission-to-investigate-ivory-coast.php">requested permission</a> [JURIST report] from ICC judges in June to begin the investigation into the Ivory Coast after determining that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed. The Ivory Coast announced earlier in that month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. This investigation <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">may take up to two years</a> [Reuters report]. Also, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0751-0800/ab_768_bill_20110909_enrolled.pdf">AB 768</a> [text, PDF], "preclude[s] a city, county, or city and county ordinance, regulation, or administrative action from prohibiting or restricting the practice of male circumcision, or the exercise of a parent's authority to have a child circumcised." It also provides that laws "affecting male circumcision must have uniform application throughout the state." Supporters of outlawing male circumcision have pressed forward elsewhere in the US. <a href="http://www.mgmbill.org/">MGMBill.org</a> [advocacy website] is devoted to submitting legislation to ban the practice and currently has bills pending in the federal government as well as 46 states.

<p>The law was written in response to a ballot measure proposed in San Francisco, the <a href="http://www.sfmgmbill.org/Site/Home.html">Male Genital Mutilation bill </a>[text]. The proposed measure would have made male circumcision illegal in San Francisco if the recipient is under the age of 18, with perpetrators penalized by a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment. In July, a judge for the <a href="http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/">Superior Court of San Francisco</a> [official website] ruled in <a href="http://webaccess.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&PRGNAME=ROA22&ARGUMENTS=-ACPF11511370">Jewish Community Relations Council of San Francisco v. Arntz</a> [materials] that the public referendum to ban circumcision <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/San-francisco-judge-rules-circumcision-ban-cannot-appear-on-ballot.php">could not appear on the ballot</a> [JURIST report]. Male circumcision is a religious practice in both Judaism and Islam, so there was an immediate protest to the initiative. Advocates for ending male circumcision believe it is a painful and archaic procedure that nets no benefits to the circumcised male. They frequently compare the practice to female genital mutilation, which is illegal under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000116----000-.html">Title 18</a> [text] of the US Code.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW alleges that the two investigating judges for the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] have "egregiously violated their legal and judicial duties ... [by failing] to conduct proper and good-faith investigations [in violation of] their responsibilities to act impartially." The rights group said that the two judges, You Bunleng of Cambodia and Siegfried Blunk of Germany, "failed to conduct genuine, impartial, and effective investigations into ECCC cases 003 and 004," and that as a result both of those case will likely be dropped. Both cases deal with allegations of atrocities committed under the Khmer Rouge regime. In April 2011, the judges declared that they had concluded their investigation into <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">Case 003</a> [materials] and a formal closing order is expected to be issued soon. The judges are also expected to close and dismiss <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">Case 004</a> [materials]. Should closing orders be issued in either case, the prosecutor can appeal to the pre-trial chamber. 

<p>In July, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-denies-reports-it-ordered-close-of-cambodia-genocide-investigation.php">UN denied reports</a> [JURIST report] it instructed the ECCC to close further investigations into war crimes committed under the Khmer Rouge regime after the controversial closing of Case 003. Doubts about the legitimacy and independence of the ECCC have been raised since the decision to close ECCC Case 3. In June, a coalition of more than 30 rights groups and development organizations in Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-urge-more-transparency-for-khmer-rouge-tribunal.php">issued an open letter</a> [JURIST report] urging the ECCC to embrace a greater degree of transparency. Earlier that week, ECCC judges ordered Co-Prosecutor Andrew Cayley to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eccc-judges-order-prosecutor-to-retract-statement-demanding-further-investigation-into-khmer-rouge-s.php">retract public statements requesting further investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Case 3. Cayley said the information was released pursuant to tribunal rules "to ensure that the public is duly informed about ongoing ECCC proceedings." The judges, however, said Cayley breached the tribunal's confidentiality and ordered the retraction. The only ECCC conviction since its founding in 2006 is of <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/1">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], better known as "Duch," a former prison chief at the notorious Toul Sleng prison under the Khmer Rouge. In March, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-khmer-rouge-official-in-court-to-appeal-war-crimes-convictions.php">appealed</a> his 35-year sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">handed down by the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports] last July. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The National Safety Court of Appeal, a court composed of military prosecutors and civilian and military judges, also issued <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/03/us-bahrain-sentences-idUSTRE7922LD20111003">sentences</a> [Reuters report] that include 15 people sentenced to 15 years for the attempted murder of military personnel, as well as acts of protest and vandalism, and six university students sentenced to 15 years for the intent to murder several people at a university after holding them hostage. The Bahrain courts have been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15151629">criticized for their severity</a> [BBC report], especially in light of the five 15-year prison terms issued to doctors and nurses convicted of rendering aid to protesters. Bahraini doctors and nurses on Saturday urged the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">investigate claims of abuse and due process violations</a> [JURIST report] in relation to their recent convictions. Last week, the National Safety Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] one anti-government protester to death for killing a police officer and gave lengthy prison sentences to medical personnel, including doctors, for providing treatment to injured protesters during the country's uprising. 

<p><a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts were instituted in mid-March under Khalifa's <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court handed the death sentence to four protesters, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men who were accused of murdering police officers. All of the charges levied in the National Safety Court have been disputed by Bahraini citizens and international rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-6549.pdf">Reynolds v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-to-examine-inmates-miranda-rights.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on the retroactive application of the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> (SORNA) [final guidelines, PDF], which requires convicted sex offenders to register. The attorney general determined in 2007 that all states would have to follow the federal rule to keep registration current. Billy Joe Reynolds pleaded guilty for failure to register his new address but attempted to challenge the application of SORNA against him because his sex offender conviction in 2001 predated the attorney general's rule change. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084747np.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that this did not give him standing to challenge the rule's application. Reynolds' attorney argued, "[o]ur reading better accords with the text of SORNA and congressional intent, but the government reading is simply not reasonable." Counsel for the federal government argued that the attorney general was acting within the scope of Congress' intent.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-958.pdf">Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-dc-same-sex-marriage-guantanamo-habeas-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the Supremacy Clause preempts Medicaid recipients and providers from bringing a suit challenging a California state law that reduces reimbursement rates. Medicaid providers&#8212;doctors, hospitals and pharmacies&#8212;are angry over a series of cutbacks by the California legislature reducing reimbursement payments in an attempt to handle the state's financial crisis. Lawyers for the state argued that the providers have no right to challenge the reimbursement rates and that they do not have any right to a particular rate of reimbursement. The case is consolidated with <span class="casename">Douglas v. Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital</span> and <span class="casename">Douglas v.

Virginia, among the first to file a challenge to PPACA, challenges the Foruth Circuit's dismissal for lack of standing as a "misapprehen[sion of] foundational and continuing role of the federal courts as arbiters of competing claims of state and federal power." The petition characterizes the ruling on sovereign standing as creating a circuit split and criticizes the Fourth Circuit's use of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine">Political Question doctrine</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder], which Virginia asserts has been abandoned, in order to withhold standing:<blockquote>[I]n 1962, ... this Court redefined the political question doctrine to exclude state-federal relations: "it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the political question." Four years later ... South Carolina was permitted to proceed with its challenge to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it was defending its own political rights rather than acting as parens patriae. Ever since, until the Fourth Circuit decided this case, state sovereign standing has been uncontroversial in this Court and in the federal circuits.</blockquote>Virginia urges the court to take the appeal and rule on the standing, but also go on to rule on the merits of the case.  

<p>The Supreme Court will likely hear the constitutional challenges to PPACA this term. Last week, both the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and a group of 26 states <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-appeal-to-supreme-court-on-health-care-law.php">filed petitions</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court seeking a review of a recent decision handed down by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. The Eleventh Circuit found the PPACA individual health care mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but upheld the remainder of the law without the mandate. Also last week, the Obama administration filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/US-opp-brief-Thomas-More-9-28-11.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] in opposition to a petition for <em>certiorari</em> <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Thomas More Law Center v.

In August, the US <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by a physician organization for lack of standing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Bahrain courts have been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15151629">criticized for their severity</a> [BBC report], especially in light of the five 15-year prison terms issued to doctors and nurses convicted of rendering aid to protesters. Bahraini doctors and nurses on Saturday urged the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">investigate claims of abuse and due process violations</a> [JURIST report] in relation to their recent convictions.

<p><a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests.

MacDonald, who was appointed to oversee the military commissions at Guantanamo in 2010, alerted lawyers in the case that they will have until January 15, 2012, to make their recommendations, ensuring that the case will not go to trial at the naval base <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/10/03/2437082/no-911-trial-this-year-at-guantanamo.html">until sometime next year</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report]. The five detainees have been held at Guantanamo since 2006 when they were transferred there from the custody of the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. The government alleges the men were organizers of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] terrorist attacks, financing and training the men who hijacked the aircrafts used in the attack. MacDonald's communication to counsel also indicates that he will be accepting recommendations in order to determine whether to try the defendants together or separately. A formal arraignment of the detainees is expected to occur later this month. 

<p>As the number of detainees at the Guantanamo facility decreases, the issue of what to do with those remaining in US custody continues to be a significant issue. Last year, Judge John Bates of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1101-236">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-allows-indefinite-detention-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">US government could indefinitely hold a detainee</a> [JURIST report] at Guantanamo, a decision <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-indefinite-detention-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcappeals.gov/dccourts/appeals/index.jsp">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in September of this year. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during his presidential campaign. In December 2010, Obama signed a defense authorization bill that <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">prohibits the transfer of detainees to the US for trial</a> [JURIST report], further confusing the future of the 177 men currently at the facility. In an effort to reduce the population at the facility, the US has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-to-algeria-a-year-after-habeas-order.php">transferring detainees</a> [JURIST report], some to their native countries. In February, The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] used the death of a Guantanamo detainee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">highlight what it claims are problems with the detention system</a> [JURIST report] currently used at the facility. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN human rights office <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39926&Cr=prejudice&Cr1=">expressed deep concern</a> [UN News Centre report] over the violence and discrimination accompanying the anti-Roma demonstrations. The demonstrations began when a Bulgarian youth was run over and killed by a van belonging to the local Roma. The OHCHR said that they hope to bring the individual responsible for the Bulgarian youth's death to justice. Further adding that it is unfair to blame an entire population for the actions of an individual. Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the OHCHR, said:<blockquote>The hate speech that has been fuelling [sic] the anti-Roma protests in Bulgaria is of great concern. It is unacceptable for an entire community to be targeted for an offence allegedly committed by an individual. We call on Bulgarian authorities at the highest political level to publicly restate this principle of individual criminal responsibility. The political leadership must take a strong stance against hate speech and ensure that police officers continue to be deployed in sufficient numbers to protect Roma neighbourhoods from threats of retribution and harassment.</blockquote>The OHCHR encouraged countries in Europe and the EU to adopt policies to end discrimination against the Roma communities.

<p>The Roma population has faced <a href="/hotline/2010/11/roma-students-face-lasting-repercussions-from-discrimination.php">discrimination</a> [JURIST comment] in various European countries. In April, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged Serbian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-serbia-to-halt-roma-evictions.php">halt the forced evictions</a> [JURIST report] of Roma in Belgrade and provide them with adequate housing and compensation. In March, AI released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-slovenia-to-pretect-roma-migrant-communities.php">report</a> [JURIST report] documenting discrimination and human rights violations against Roma migrants in Slovenia and urging the Slovenian government to protect Roma communities. The report revealed that Roma communities are being denied access to housing, water and sanitation. Much of the Roma population is living in overcrowded shacks without access to adequate health care services, schools, shops and employment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report indicates that as many as five million voters may be affected by the changes and may find itsignificantly harder to vote in 2012:
<blockquote>These new restrictions fall most heavily on young, minority, and low-income voters, as well as on voters with disabilities. This wave of changes may sharply tilt the political terrain for the 2012 election. ... Although it is too early to quantify how the changes will impact voter turnout, they will be a hindrance to many voters at a time when the United States continues to turn out less than two thirds of its eligible citizens in presidential elections and less than half in midterm elections.</blockquote>The study examined the five broad categories of new election laws: those that require voters show photo identification to vote, those that require proof of citizenship to register to vote, those that make it harder to register to vote by eliminating same day voter registration, those that reduce early and absentee voting and those that make it harder for convicted felons to restore their voting rights. The study notes that further changes to states election laws may occur as the second halves of some state legislative sessions have already begun.

<p>Of the changes in state voting laws, requirements that voters present some form of ID at the polls are the most prevalent. With the new changes in place, there are now 30 US states that require voters to present ID, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August, South Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">civil rights groups urged</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to block the state from implementing a <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/3003.htm">new law</a> [R54 materials] that would require voters to present photo ID in order to cast their ballots. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have required individuals to present government-issued photo ID at the voting booth. In May, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld a state law</a> [JURIST report] that requires voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 24-year-old student claimed that senior al Qaeda leader, American-born <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>] is <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Trial-to-begin-for-man-accused-in-underwear-attack-2200476.php">still alive</a> [AP report], despite reports that a CIA drone strike in Yemen Friday <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed al-Awlaki</a> [JURIST report]. Abdulmutallab said he wants to represent himself in trial, making the jury process unpredictable. Approximately 250 potential jurors have filled out questionnaires, and 12 jurors will be selected along with four alternatives. Opening arguments will begin on October 11.

In December 2010, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/accused-plane-bomber-facing-additional-federal-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Abdulmutallab with two new counts of conspiracy and firearm possession, in addition to the six previous <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_10-04-11.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in three cases on Tuesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-63.pdf">Maples v. Thomas</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-to-examine-whether-death-penalty-appeal-can-continue-despite-missed-deadline.php">report</a>], the court considered a death penalty appeal where Cory Maples missed his ability to appeal his sentence due to a clerk's error. An Alabama trial court had dismissed Maples' petition for post-conviction relief and sent notice of this ruling to his out-of-state attorneys, but the notice was returned to the court unopened because the attorneys had changed firms. The court's clerk did not attempt to notify his attorneys again. The clerk did, however, notify Maples' in-state attorney who neither acted nor notified the attorneys who were more directly involved in his case. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held the state of Alabama may execute Cory Maples without federal <em>habeas</em> review of his constitutional claims. Maples' attorney argued that he effectively had no local counsel, thus the lack of proper notification to his true counsel, who had never withdrawn, was a clear error. The state of Alabama argued that the notice was adequate and claimed that the local attorney had enough of a role to adequately appeal for Maples.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1001.pdf">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-decide.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether, when arguing prior ineffective counsel, an appellant has the right to new counsel provided by the state. Typically, the constitutional right to counsel ends after the first post-conviction appeal. But appellant Luis Martinez wanted to argue his trial attorney was ineffective after his appeal and asked that the state of Arizona provide him counsel for this. This proceeding, under Arizona law, mandates a separate trial court and is to be made between conviction and appeal. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that since there is no right to appointment of counsel during a defendant's post-conviction relief petition, there is no right to effective assistance of counsel. Martinez's attorney argued that this narrow window deprives his client of constitutional right to counsel and that counsel should be extended to any "first-tier review issue," especially considering evidence of attorney negligence could present years after the trial. The state of Arizona brought up the costs and impracticality of the rule: "This Court has never&#8212;has never said that every claim that can only be raised for the first time entitles someone to&#8212;to counsel. And that exception, that would&#8212;that would swallow the rule."</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-680.pdf">Howes v. Fields</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-to-examine-inmates-miranda-rights.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on how far to extend the Miranda privilege in jail. Randall Fields was questioned by investigators about a child sex-abuse case while he was in the county jail serving a 45-day sentence for disorderly conduct. A lower court found that Fields did not have to be given his Miranda rights because the investigators were questioning him about a separate crime. This decision was reversed by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that Miranda is necessary anytime the suspect is isolated from the rest of the jail inmates in a situation where the suspect would be likely to incriminate himself. The state of Michigan argued that since Fields invoked his right to return to his cell, despite being confined in jail, a reasonable person in jail being taken to an interrogation room would have understood it was an interrogation and Miranda was unnecessary:<blockquote>You know, it's so coercive to take an 8-year-old child to the principal's office with an officer to question him, that per se is always going to be some child version of the Miranda rule. Or if you had someone in the hospital and they were in such a position that they were physically unable to leave. But we don't do that. We don't have a hospital Miranda rule. There shouldn't be one in prison, either. We should just take all the circumstances into account.</blockquote>Michigan's attorney also argued against a new <em>per se</em> rule that was created by the Sixth Circuit rather than applying the traditional "all the circumstances" test for Miranda. Fields' attorney contended that he felt no freedom to leave and that in a prison or jail situation, a reasonable person would not feel a freedom to leave without being read Miranda rights in that situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The laws at issue represented a part of the <a href="http://www.dcwatch.com/council17/17-886.htm">Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008</a> (FRA) [text], which the district adopted following the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>] that the prior laws restricting possession of firearms in one's home violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentii">Second Amendment rights</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/guncontrol.php">news archive</a>] of individuals to keep and bear arms. The plaintiffs in the case challenged both the authority of the District to pass the FRA as well as its constitutionality. The court, determining that the district had authority to promulgate the laws, next considered whether each of the challenged provisions was consistent with the Second Amendment. The provisions at issue included those requiring basic and additional registration requirements as well as those prohibiting the ownership of assault weapons and magazines holding more than ten rounds of ammunition. In its constitutional analysis, the court distinguished between the longstanding general registration requirements, which it held were presumptively lawful and "novel" registration requirements, which mandated that an applicant appear in person and meet a vision requirement, among other things. The latter requirements did not qualify for the presumption of lawfulness and were remanded to the district court for further analysis. In upholding the constitutionality of the prohibition laws, the court stated:<blockquote>Unlike the law held unconstitutional in Heller, the laws at issue here do not prohibit the possession of "the quintessential self-defense weapon," to wit, the handgun. Nor does the ban on certain semi-automatic rifles prevent a person from keeping a suitable and commonly used weapon for protection in the home or for hunting, whether a handgun or a non-automatic long gun.</blockquote>In its holding, the court emphasized that the rights secured by the Second Amendment are not unlimited and the prohibition law is a reasonable limitation that does not violate the constitutional rights of residents in the District of Columbia.

<p>Gun control laws remain a contentious issue across the US. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-blocks-florida-law-restricting-doctors-from-asking-patients-about-firearms.php">temporarily enjoined</a> [JURIST report] a Florida law restricting what physicians can ask or say about firearms to their patients as violative of the doctors' First Amendment rights. Under the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/0432/BillText/c2/HTML">Firearm Owners' Privacy Act</a> (FOPA) [text], violating doctors risk losing their medical license and up to a $10,000 fine for "asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm" or "unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership." Judge Marcia Cooke rejected Florida's argument that the law was about protecting Second Amendment rights. The temporary <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-guns-doctors-odds-idUSTRE78E4B520110915">injunction seems likely to become permanent</a> [Reuters report].  In March, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] called for <a href="/paperchase//2011/03/obama-calls-for-gun-law-reforms-to-minimize-violence.php">greater enforcement of gun laws</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of the January <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-federal-judge-killed-in-shooting-congresswoman-in-critical-condition.php">shootings in Arizona</a> [JURIST report]. In an opinion piece published by the <em>Arizona Daily Star</em>, Obama called for the implementation of "sound and effective steps" aimed at minimizing gun violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This initiative <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/05/germany-reopens-investigations-nazi-guards">results from the conviction</a> [AP report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>], a retired US autoworker who served as a guard at a camp in Poland in 1943 and was deported to Germany in 2009 in order to stand trial on allegations that he helped to murder thousands during the Holocaust. Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in May and sentenced to five years in prison, but was released due to his advanced age and that the verdict is not final. Because the remaining suspects are also advanced in age, the German prosecutors will not wait until Demjanjuk's appeal process is finished, but will begin investigations within the next two months. The significance Demjanjuk's conviction and its relation to the renewed investigations lies in the fact that he was convicted despite the absence of direct evidence that he participated in the actual killings. The court found that the establishment of his position as a guard at a camp, which was created for the purpose of extermination, was sufficient. These investigations and subsequent trials are possible in Germany as the country does not impose a statute of limitations for murder and related charges.

<p>Germany is not alone in its pursuit to remedy crimes committed during the Holocaust. In July, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] at The Hague <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/italy-seeks-damages-for-nazi-crimes-at-un-tribunal.php">began hearing arguments</a> [JURIST report] from Germany and Italy, which is seeking damages from Germany for crimes committed by Nazis during World War II. In November 2008, Germany filed a lawsuit against Italy in the ICJ in a bid to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-files-icj-suit-against-italy-to.php">block new claims</a> [JURIST report] for personal damages resulting from Nazi actions in World War II. Germany is arguing that an October 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by Italy's <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] which ordered Germany to pay 1 million euros (USD $1.3 million) in damages to relatives of civilians killed in the town of Civitella during the war, violated the principle of state immunity. The lawyers representing Germany argued before the court that <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-09-12-EU-World-Court-Germany-Italy/id-8fc7fda191d94ae4875de40fbab62c8d">international law would be "atomized" and "politicized"</a> [AP report] if the ICJ were to accept the Italian court's decision. Germany further argues that it has already compensated Italy for Nazi-related damages pursuant to a 1961 treaty. The ICJ is not expected to hand down its decision for several months. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court sentenced 13 protesters to five years in prison and six people to one year for their participation in protests <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iFJWOPGFMdyvKZJAUSqGMs4D-ijA?docId=89085458de0d44e08b6ee78606f5d005">seeking greater rights for the Shiite majority</a> [AP report]. One of the sentenced protesters is 16-year-old Iraqi soccer player, Zulfiqar Naji, whose arrest has sparked <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/09/156803.html">protests in Iraq</a> [<em>Al Arabiya</em> report] calling for his release. The court on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-military-court-sentences-26-more-protesters.php">sentenced 26 protesters</a>, including prominent members of the Shiite political group, to prison terms ranging from 5-15 years and on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-military-court-sentences-protesters-students.php">sentenced 40 protesters</a> [JURIST reports], including university students, to 15-25 years for crimes ranging from rioting to attempted murder. The Bahrain courts have been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15151629">criticized for their severity</a> [BBC report], especially in light of the five 15-year prison terms issued to doctors and nurses convicted of rendering aid to protesters. Bahraini doctors and nurses on Saturday urged the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">investigate claims of abuse and due process violations</a> [JURIST report] in relation to their recent convictions. Last week, the National Safety Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] one anti-government protester to death for killing a police officer and gave lengthy prison sentences to medical personnel, including doctors, for providing treatment to injured protesters during the country's uprising. 

<p>Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts were instituted in mid-March under Khalifa's <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by Human Rights Watch (HRW). The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court handed the death sentence to four protesters, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men who were accused of murdering police officers. All of the charges levied in the National Safety Court have been disputed by Bahraini citizens and international rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an address to <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/index.php?modload=sites&action=innerpage&id=5&view=23&uweb=p&lang=en">Parliament</a> [official website] earlier this week, <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-najib-razak/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h4ymZ7H4RReTueVkd1WZWv-7h4JQ?docId=19328702c56e43f3b61c3ea12b842d5b">announced the release</a> [AP report] of all individuals being held under the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20377.pdf">Restricted Residence Act of 1933</a> [text, PDF], the British colonial-era act that enables authorities to banish suspects to remote districts and force them to report regularly to police. The law has been used to detain criminal suspects who, like many of the individuals just released, have never been charged in court. The identities of the freed prisoners have been withheld, but those held under the act in the past two years include suspected robbery gang members and a religious teacher accused of spreading militant ideologies. As the prisoners were released, Najib stated the government would also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5igezWOC0jA-W-124ShYIM5WLuAdw?docId=CNG.1115db5cc2628f77f4863b0a574661ed.4c1">revoke more than 200 unserved warrants</a> [AFP report] issued under the law. In his address to Parliament, Najib called the Restricted Residence Act outdated, partly due to technological advances that allow exiled criminals to communicate with confederates still in the country. Parliament is expected to approve a bill this month to revoke the act as a larger effort to repeal several tough security laws viewed by many as outdated and oppressive.

<p>Malaysia's strict security laws have been widely criticized for years. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-amend-internal-security-laws.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] last year that Malaysia repeal or amend its internal security laws, reflecting allegations that the laws violate human rights. Najib's address to Parliament on Monday officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malayasia-pm-initiates-repeal-of-security-laws.php">initiated the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of several of these laws, expected to culminate in March with the revocation of the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf">Internal Security Act of 1960</a> (ISA) [text, PDF], which has allowed the government to detain opposition critics, alleged militants and labor activists for a period of up to two years without a trial. Najib had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">originally announced the repeals</a> [JURIST report], as well as the review of other laws dealing with freedom of the press, in September, but they were tabled over the past month. The repeal of the ISA and similar laws are generally considered a political move by the prime minister, designed to boost his uncertain re-election hopes three months after police used tear gas and water cannon to crush a street rally calling for electoral reforms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The allegations stem from a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/ERES1782.htm">report</a> [text] authored by <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] member <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4526418.stm">Dick Marty</a> [BBC profile] that implicates Kosovo <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,4">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [official profile] as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-weighs-kosovo-organ-trafficking-investigation.php">"boss" of an illegal criminal enterprise</a> [JURIST report] that trafficked human organs and drugs during the war. According to the report, criminals harvested the organs of civilian detainees killed on Albanian territory near the Albania-Kosovo border and sold the organs on the black market for overseas transplants. De Marnhac's announcement came <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/world/europe/trial-opens-for-7-kosovars-in-organ-trafficking-case.html">one day after a trial opened</a> [NYT report] in Kosovo for seven Kosovars, mostly doctors, accused of organ trafficking and organized crime. The defendants appeared before a three-judge panel led by EULEX. Also on Wednesday, de Marnhac urged supporters to remain calm after an EULEX employee <a href="http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1727058">survived an alleged car bombing</a> [AP report] that occurred outside an EU building in Kosovo.

<p>EULEX announced in August that US prosecutor John Clint Williamson would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/us-prosecutor-to-investigate-kosovo-pm-for-organ-trafficking.php">lead an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Thaci was the leader of the KLA Drenica Group, a criminal network that controlled the heroin trade and the black market trafficking of kidneys of executed Serbian and Albanian war prisoners during the Kosovo War. Thaci strongly denies the allegations and has pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Claims of Kosovo's involvement in human organ trafficking originated in 2008 when former prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=del+ponte">Carla Del Ponte</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged in a book</a> [JURIST report] about her time at the tribunal that roughly 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of organ trafficking during the war. That year, Serbian prosecutors condemned Albania's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/albania-prosecutor-refuses-to.php">refusal to initiate</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo. Albanian Prosecutor General Ina Rama refused to cooperate with Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic and said that her country would only pursue the allegations if the ICTY decided to reopen its investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Parliamentary deputies <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20111005/167407642.html">refused</a> [RIA Novosti report] to include in the agenda for discussion proposed amendments to the Code, which were introduced by the opposition party led by former prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>], who is currently on trial and faces seven years in prison if found guilty of exceeding her authority in January 2009 by signing a contract for Russian gas supplies to Ukraine without approval from her government. The bills containing the proposed amendments sought to decriminalize Article 365 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates jail time for abuse of office:<blockquote>Excess of authority or official powers, that is a willful commission of acts, by an official, which patently exceed the rights and powers vested in him/her, where it caused any substantial damage to the legally protected rights and interest of individual citizens, or state and public interests, or interests of legal entities ... if they caused any grave consequences, - shall be punishable by imprisonment for a term of seven to ten years with the deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities for a term up to three years.</blockquote>Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko">news archive</a>] has faced strong Western criticism over the trial, which Tymoshenko and her supporters have called political motivated. Tymoshenko has said she expects to be found guilty.

<p>Tymoshenko's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-prosecutors-seek-7-year-sentence-for-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">resumed</a> at the end of September after a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-trial-delayed.php">two-week recess</a> [JURIST reports]. In August Yushchenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-president-testifies-against-former-ally-tymoshenko.php">testified against</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko, his former prime minister. That same month, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukrain</a>e (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by Yanukovych. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-553.pdf">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-religious-school-teachers-may-sue-for-discrimination.php">report</a>], the court considered whether an employment discrimination claim can be brought under the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08mark.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text] against a religiously affiliated school despite the Act's "ministerial exception." The exception allows religious organizations to give "preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion" and to "require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such organization." The <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] and Cheryl Perich brought a claim against the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School alleging that the school had unlawfully terminated Perich in violation of the ADA because she was diagnosed with narcolepsy. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] held that the school violated the ADA and that the ministerial exception did not apply. Counsel for the school argued that the ADA did not apply due to the exception, Perich's only recourse was to ask for a hearing before the church's administrative board, and the case should not be heard in civil courts. Counsel further argued to draw a bright line distinction between who is to be considered a minister under the exception and who is not, stating that the case could be tried if the label of "minister" was a sham. Counsel for the EEOC and Perich argued that the exception clearly applies to ministers and religious leaders, but Perich was responsible for numerous secular duties that should not be considered under the exception. Counsel alleged there was no difference between the employment dispute with the religious organization and a similar dispute with a secular organization stating that "the government has a compelling and indeed overriding interest in ensuring that individuals are not prevented from coming to the government with information about illegal conduct."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-545.pdf">Golan v. Holder</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-to-rule-on-copyright-protections-for-foreign-works.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments to determine the copyright status of foreign works that used to be in the public domain. Specifically, the issue for the court to consider is whether section 514 of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/doc/uruguay/uraaact.html">Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994</a> (URAA) [text], which restored copyright protection to thousands of foreign works previously in the public domain, violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Progress Clause</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] held that section 514 did not violate the constitutional principles. Counsel for the government argued that the URAA was necessary in order to align the country with international intellectual property rules, stating that the Act was "of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property." Counsel for the petitioners, which included orchestra conductors, educators, performers, film archivists and motion picture distributors, argued that the URAA imposed a "remarkable" burden on speech.<blockquote>There can't be any doubt ... that performance has a huge amount of original expression bound up in it.  It's the reason it's different to see King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company; it's the reason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz standard.  [There is a] huge amount of expression.</blockquote>Counsel further argued against the government's position that the US needs to be aligned with the intellectual property policies of other countries. Counsel argued that the court had previously recognized a "critical speech interest" in publishing, performing or showing the work of another and that "the burden here is [the URAA] took speech rights of 250 million Americans and turned them into the private property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility that [it] might put more money in the pocket of some US authors."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The violence began last November when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> defeated incumbent president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profiles], but Gbagbo refused to cede power. The report alleges that pro-Gbagbo forces then began a "targeted campaign of violence" against Ouatarra supporters and political leaders. The report further alleges that during the pro-Ouattara supporters' coordinated offensive to take over the country, they executed unarmed pro-Gbagbo militiamen and men from ethnic groups aligned with Gbagbo. During the six-month conflict at least 3,000 civilians were killed and more than 150 women were raped. Charges have been brought against 118 Gbagbo supporters, but not a single member of the pro-Ouattara forces has been prosecuted for their role in the post-election violence. The report warns that such conduct creates the risk of "victor's justice" and that the government must "send a message that a new era of impartial justice and human rights has begun." Although the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] has agreed to open an investigation, the report stressed the importance of domestic trials in order to "help maximize the rebuilding of respect for rule of law."

<p>The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-to-open-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">granted the request</a> [JURIST report] of Chief Prosecutor Luis-Moreno Ocampo to open an investigation into the Ivory Coast's post-election violence earlier this week. Ocampo officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-requests-permission-to-investigate-ivory-coast.php">requested permission</a> [JURIST report] from ICC judges in June to begin the investigation after determining that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed. The Ivory Coast announced earlier in that month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. This investigation <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">may take up to two years</a> [Reuters report]. Also, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo. In April, HRW urged <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs in the case this week sought to temporarily enjoin the immigration law while they appeal last week's memorandum opinion, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">refused to enjoin a majority of the law's provisions</a> [JURIST report] during the trial in which the plaintiffs will ultimately seek to overturn the law entirely by challenging its constitutionality. Chief Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn cut through this procedural web by denying the whole of the emergency motion, citing precedent that an order for an injunction pending an appeal of an earlier decision on an injunction "is considered an 'extraordinary remedy'" requiring movants to show they have a substantial case likely to prevail on its merits:<blockquote>For the reasons set forth in the court's Memorandum Opinion, the court finds that plaintiffs have not shown that they are "likely to prevail" nor that they have a "substantial case" on the merits. The court carefully and thoroughly reviewed all issues raised by the parties and its lengthy Memorandum Opinion represents the product of its time and effort. It does not foresee a "substantial" case for reversal. ... The court has found that plaintiffs are not likely to be able to show that Sections 10, 12, 27, 28, and 30 [of the law] are due to be enjoined. Alabama has an interest in enforcing laws properly enacted by its Legislature and not likely to be found unconstitutional.</blockquote>Alternatively the plaintiffs requested a temporary injunction while they file the same motion for a temporary injunction with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Blackburn denied that request as well.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], joined by several rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-immigration-law.php">appeared before the court last month</a> [JURIST report] to make arguments against the law's enactment, at which point Blackburn issued the temporary injunction to forestall enactment of the challenged provisions while she evaluated their contention with federal statute. Religious groups and representatives of several rights groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC), the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] have stated that the Alabama law is the most extreme of the recent state anti-immigration laws influenced by controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=SB+1070">Arizona SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive]. Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">lawmakers have defended</a> the legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST reports] in June. Since that time, 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bell graduated from the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> [official website] in 1957, the only African-American in his class.  He subsequently worked for the US Justice Department and the NAACP before beginning an academic career in the 1960s. Bell pioneered a new approach to the study of racism known as critical race theory, exploring the extent to which racism is fully embedded into societal institutions, including laws. He theorized that a majority population would only support efforts to improve the position of a minority when and to the extent that the interests of the groups converge. In his own scholarship Bell embraced allegorical storytelling rather than traditional legal analysis. His parable <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~mseth2/com417/readings/BellSpaceTraders.pdf"><u>The Space Traders</u></a> [PDF], published in 1992, is perhaps the best known example of this still controversial approach.

<p>Throughout his life, Bell repeatedly took public stands against what he perceived as racism.  In 1959, he resigned his position with the Justice Department rather than give up his membership in the NAACP. In the 1980s, he resigned as Dean of the <a href="http://www.law.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon School of Law</a> [official website] when he believed that minority candidates were not being properly considered for the faculty. After returning to Harvard Law School, Bell engaged in a public battle regarding the school's hiring practices and lack of diversity, ultimately leading him to take an unpaid leave of absence in 1990, followed by the school formally removing him in 1992.  Bell continued to work as a scholar and <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?personID=19776">visiting professor at New York University School of Law</a> [official website, faculty profile] until his death. In 2003, Bell contributed an <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/bell-printer.php">essay</a> to an early JURIST online symposium on the <u>Gratz</u> and <u>Grutter</u> affirmative actions cases then recently decided in the US Supreme Court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Dr. Ali al-Boainain, Bahrain's attorney general, stated that the department of public prosecution had studied the judgment rendered against the 20 Shiite medics by the National Safety Court of Appeal and determined that the cases should be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j196BRDjQ9BuMtS53E9-0J8cMiJQ?docId=CNG.62960d81c9574355889ec2e3eeb14bb3.4f1">retried in the civilian courts</a> [AFP report]. The 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics who were jailed for providing treatment to injured protesters all worked at the Salmaniya Medical Complex in Manama, which was stormed by security forces in March after they drove protesters out of the nearby Pearl Square&#8212;the focal point of protests inspired by uprisings that have swept the Arab world. Among other terrorism charges, the 20 were accused of having possession of an AK-47, Molotov cocktails and other weapons for the purposes of ousting the ruling regime, confiscating medical equipment, spreading lies, inciting hatred against the regime and violating various other laws and regulations with an aim to disturb public security. The prosecutor stated that the medics' cases will start from scratch and the individuals should not be punished merely for their political views. The retrials will be conducted before the highest civil court in Bahrain, and the 20 will remain out of government custody, pending the outcome of their trials. The National Safety Court of Appeal, a court composed of military prosecutors and civilian and military judges, was set up in the wake of the March crackdown on pro-democracy protests led by the Shiite majority against the Sunni ruling family.

<p>Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests.

In the judicial decision, Chaudhry announced that militant groups have gained strength because of support from local political groups and ordered the Pakistani government to help address the corruption:<blockquote>The problem can only be solved through application of special means as well as requesting political leadership to eliminate militancy from their wings. The political face of the city has been taken hostage by militant groups of political parties. Political parties are penetrated by the criminals under the garb of political groups who use party flags. The militants and criminals are taking refuge in the lap of political and ethnic parties which use the flags of these parties to commit illegal activities with impunity.</blockquote>Chaudhry quoted Article 9 of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDUQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mofa.gov.pk%2FPublications%2Fconstitution.pdf&rct=j&q=Pakistan%20constitution&ei=Ue2NTrbdO6ne0QHqgqlY&usg=AFQjCNF7qfbxXhoQER8qo9C8NLvelKIaGA&sig2=a_T4EOwgICHCbtynHUvYIw&cad=rja">Pakistani Constitution</a> [text, PDF], upholding the fundamental rights of individuals to life and liberty under the law.

<p>Pakistan faces an ongoing struggle dealing with politicians allegedly involved with violent crime.

The judge ordered the nation's <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/">Federal Investigation Agency</a> (FIA) [official website] to conduct the seizure because Musharraf had <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/08/201182714049195151.html">failed to respond to multiple subpoenas</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report].

Kokott said that the carbon emission fees do not violate international law, as several US and Canadian airlines have argued. The airlines filed for judicial review of an EU <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Feur-lex.europa.eu%2FLexUriServ%2FLexUriServ.do%3Furi%3DOJ%3AL%3A2009%3A008%3A0003%3A0003%3AEN%3APDF&rct=j&q=Directive%202008%2F101%2FEC&ei=zviNTuHRLuXi0QGntM0U&usg=AFQjCNG3d0Crac_UfZfi7exS3odpWjAwog&sig2=Pfb_AlcbjFFZ9ZjIxJY5Ng&cad=rja">Directive 2008/101/EC</a> [PDF], which announced that airlines would have to comply with heightened emissions regulations while using EU airports beginning on January 1, 2012. The airlines argued that the directive violated the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcgill.ca%2Ffiles%2Fiasl%2Fchicago1944a.pdf&rct=j&q=Chicago%20Convention%20PDF&ei=GfqNTsTdJerr0gHK2K0r&usg=AFQjCNENIqGbClCYwzTk-wSlqss58ZJrHQ&sig2=XM9RFDWQSRx1DIGo3UlFTg&cad=rja">Chicago Convention</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Fresource%2Fdocs%2Fconvkp%2Fkpeng.pdf&rct=j&q=Kyoto%20Protocol%20PDF&ei=PfqNTsD-LaXj0QHlgpg0&usg=AFQjCNHukaAxko7B3nIYwCKVLF2Le2JGdA&sig2=sIy0HbXHMV_O8IdbDMyFHw&cad=rja">Kyoto Protocol</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsa.gov%2Fgraphics%2Fogp%2FUS-EU_Transport_Agreement.pdf&rct=j&q=Open%20Skies%20Agreement%20PDF&ei=Y_qNTvGMKon30gHtr_A1&usg=AFQjCNHuTesv_YvOQG3zZnHFSAhRQQqMYQ&sig2=BjmxeDi7QO31r0HOtbYwRA&cad=rja">Open Skies Agreement</a> [PDFs]. However, Kokott said that the directive does not violate the international agreements, noting that the EU is not a party to the Chicago Convention. The opinion of the advocate general is advisory and not binding on the ECJ, which will subsequently rule on the issue.

<p>The EU has played an active role in environmental issues. Last month, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ecj-rules-france-ban-on-genetically-modified-maize-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that France's ban on the cultivation of a genetically modified (GM) maize was illegal. Although France has the right to impose a ban on GM maize, the court stated that France acted illegally by not following proper <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/09/08/uk-eu-court-gmo-idUKTRE7873Y920110908">EU protocol</a> [Reuters report]. In order to impose a ban, EU members must demonstrate that the product poses a serious risk to the environment or human or animal health, and notify the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] authorities of the need to take emergency measures. In March, ECJ Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi issued an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ecj-legal-adviser-finds-ban-on-genetically-modified-crops-illegal.php">opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that a French ban on cultivating genetically modified (GM) crops was illegal. The use of GM organisms, whether through experimentation or cultivation, is governed by EU law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Defense counsel argued that witnesses for the prosecution were <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/war-crimes-prosecutors-botched-kenya-probe-131944032.html">motivated by greed</a> [AFP report] and that the charges against the three men should be dropped. The prosecution contends that Francis Kirimi Muthaura, Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and Mohammed Hussein Ali, members of the Party for National Unity (PNU), conspired with the <a href="http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access Backgrounder, PDF] to attack members of the opposing <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website]. The three Kenyan leaders are charged along with three others, collectively known as the "<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/">Ocampo Six</a>," [ICC materials] for their roles in the post-election violence that resulted in over 1,100 deaths, 3,500 injuries, hundreds of rapes and up to 600,000 people being forcibly displaced from their homes.

<p>The Ocampo Six include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the ODM and the other three are members of the opposing party, the PNU. The ODM suspects are charged with fomenting violence against PNU supporters following the 2007 elections because they believed the election of Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile], the PNU candidate, to be rigged. In response, the PNU suspects are charged with the conspiring with the Mungiki to attack members of the ODM party. Kenya officially appealed the ICC's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/kenya-appeals-icc-decision-on-jurisdiction-for-post-election-violence-cases.php">exercise jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over the cases in June after originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requesting that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report] in April. Also in April, lawyers for the Ocampo Six called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-ask-for-evidence-from-icc-prosecutor.php">timely release of evidence</a> [JURIST report] against their clients while the prosecution argued that it was necessary to partially redact portions of the evidence in order to protect witnesses from intimidation. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining that the Kenyan government was unwilling to charge them for their alleged crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The five-year plan <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2011/10/111006_humanrights.shtml">fulfills Sri Lanka's pledge</a> [BBC report] made in 2008 as part of the <a href="http://www.upr-info.org/">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website; UNHRC <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">backgrounder</a>]. According to Samarasinghe, the plan will be <a href="http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/07/pol01.asp">implemented by stakeholder ministries</a> [<em>Daily News</em> report] and <a href="http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5492435">takes effect immediately</a> [PTI report]. The plan addresses <a href="http://print.dailymirror.lk/news/front-page-news/58324.html">eight areas</a> [<em>Daily Mirror</em> report]: civil and political rights, economic, social, and cultural rights, children's rights, labor and migrant worker rights, and the prevention of torture. The plan will be submitted to UN High Commissioner for Human rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile].

<p>Sri Lanka has come under international criticism for allegations of human rights violations. Last month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] accusing Sri Lankan troops of killing tens of thousands of civilians during clashes with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] in 2009. In April, a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In December, the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced that the UN panel would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes. The decision signaled a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government, which described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. <a href="http://president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] appointed his own Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. Despite having its credibility contested by several human rights organizations, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-war-crimes-commission-begins-public-hearings.php">LLRC began public hearings</a> [JURIST report] in August 2010 with an appearance by Sri Lankan Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-defense-minister-defends-government-conduct-during-civil-war.php">defended the actions of the government</a> [JURIST report] during the conflict. The government has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces violated international law during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

General Mark Martins</a> [official profile], on Wednesday indicated future <a href="http://www.mc.mil/HOME.aspx">military commissions</a> [official website] at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST news archive] will be more transparent and fair to defendants. In addition to congressionally mandated changes like restrictions on the use of evidence obtained through torture or coercion, Martins highlighted a new <a href="http://www.mc.mil/LEGALRESOURCES/MilitaryCommissionsDocuments.aspx">website</a> [link] where more court documents will be posted more promptly, as well as a viewing area near Washington where relatives of victims and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmvWtkRIE_K6Z5rm-lw80GSbxMDA?docId=338e2f1cff104471b7bb211b920bf3cc">journalists will be able to observe proceedings</a> [AP report] via video feed. Critics, including deputy chief defense counsel Bryan Broyles, have called the restrictions meaningless because prosecutors can use information indirectly derived from torture. Announcing additional undisclosed changes would be made, Martin indicated the outcome of the trials would be legitimate. The heavily criticized tribunals are set to restart soon with the arraignment of <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile] who is accused of planning the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 sailors and wounded 40.

<p>Unable to close Guantanamo due to resistance in Congress, the Obama administration has revamped its approach.  Earlier this week, retired <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Vice Admiral Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] notified lawyers in the trial of five Guantanamo detainees that he will be accepting recommendations until early 2012 on whether the trial should move forward as a death penalty case, ensuring that the case will not go to trial at the naval base until <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/guantanamo-military-commissions-on-hold-until-new-year.php">sometime next year</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/"><a href="/paperchase/2011/06/dod-names-new-chief-prosecutor-at-guantanamo.php">announced the appointment</a></a> [JURIST report] of Martins as the new chief war crimes prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay as head of the Office of Military Commissions. Martins, who was serving in Afghanistan as the commander of the Rule of Law Field Force at the time, is a graduate of Harvard Law and former Rhodes Scholar. In April 2010, the DOD <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d2010manual.pdf">released a manual</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pentagon-releases-manual-for-military.php">report</a>] for military commission procedures under the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF]. The manual established the rules of evidence and procedure for the commissions, allowing for the admission of certain hearsay evidence and defining "material support" for terrorism. The release came a month after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-appoints-top.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] MacDonald as the convening authority for military commissions. The position oversees military commissions themselves as well as the Office of Military Commissions and, notably, has the power to review and approve charges against "belligerents" pursuant to the Military Commissions Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report found that young men in Central and Southern America, Central and Southern Africa and the Caribbean are at the greatest risk of intentional homicide, while women remain at the greatest risk of being victims of homicide as a result of domestic violence. The UNODC noted that firearms were the cause of death in nearly three-fourths of the homicides in countries with the highest homicide rates, while they were the cause of death in only 21 percent of homicides in European countries. The report further asserts that gun crime is driving the rate of violent crimes in Central America and the Caribbean, which are the only regions to show rising homicide rates. The Executive Director of the UNODC, <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/eds-corner/index.html">Yury Fedotov</a> [official profile], indicated that any measures aimed at preventing crime must include the ratification and implementation of the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/Special/2001%20Protocol%20against%20the%20Illicit%20Manufacturing%20of%20and%20Trafficking%20in%20Firearms.pdf">Firearms Protocol</a> [text, PDF], in order to address rising gun violence. The report also noted a correlation between crime and development, with countries experiencing wide income disparities being four times more likely to experience increased homicide rates than countries with low income disparity. Additionally, countries with higher rates of economic growth experience a decrease in homicide rates. Links between organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, and increased homicide rates as a result of gun violence were also noted by the UNODC.

<p>In June 2010, the UNODC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-releases-report-detailing-impact-of-global-organized-crime.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the globalization of organized crime and its threat to international security. The report specifically addressed the global economic impact of human and drug trafficking, sale of illicit firearms, piracy, identity theft and the illegal exploitation of natural resources. The head of the UNODC announced the findings and warned of possible implications including the use of weapons and violence to buy elections, politicians and power. The report echoed <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-stresses-need-for-international-efforts-in-fighting-organized-crime.php">warnings issued by the UNODC</a> [JURIST report] in May 2010, stating that the inadequacies of the current international crime control system are allowing organized crime organizations to gain economic strength.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Six notices of appeal have been filed in the case since an agreement was reached in June. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit had requested that appellants be required to post an $8.3 million bond pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/node/37720">Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure</a> [text], because the appeals will "delay indefinitely class members' relief." The plaintiffs further asserted that a delay in disbursement of the funds will deny some members of the class any relief because they are elderly and likely to die before the appeals are settled. Challengers to the settlement argued that the costs put forth by the plaintiffs were exaggerated, and that the appeals are not frivolous and will be brought in good faith. Judge Thomas Hogan denied the plaintiffs' request for a bond stating that the request was misleading and the monetary amounts put forth by the plaintiff's, "exaggerated." Hogan chided plaintiffs' attorneys for the content of their motions, stating:<blockquote>While the Court is sympathetic to the plaintiffs' concern that the appeals will delay the administration and distribution of the settlement to so many people who have waited so long for justice, that does not translate into a willingness by this Court to quietly overlook the misleading case citations and unsupported legal argument throughout the plaintiffs' motions and reply brief. In several instances the plaintiffs make sweeping statements in their motions asserting that either the D.C. Circuit or this Court has established "practices" or follows certain legal principles but fail to cite any persuasive authority to back this up, and in other instances the plaintiffs cite no cases or cases that do not support the proposition asserted.</blockquote>Hogan further stated that the writing used by the attorneys went "beyond fair advocacy and border[ed] on misrepresentation." While the court did not sanction the attorneys for the plaintiffs, they were ordered to file a declaration with the court addressing the each of the court's concerns with the motions and explain whether the errors were "intentional, the result of carelessness and haste, or can otherwise be explained." 

<p>Congress established the Indian trust in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases of Indian lands. The suit has been underway for 15 years, with a federal judge approving of the most expensive class-action settlement against the US government ever approved. In October 2010, Hogan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-extends-deadline-for-congress-to-approve-indian-trust-settlement.php">extended the deadline</a> [JURIST report] for Congress to approve the $3.4 billion settlement concerning the US government's alleged <a href="http://www.doi.gov/archive/indiantrust.html">mismanagement of funds</a> [DOI materials] held in trust for American Indian landowners. In April 2010, US district court judge James Robertson also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-grants-delay-in-american.php">granted Congress additional time</a> [JURIST report] to consider the settlement. In July 2009, the district court <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-interior.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of Interior</a> [official website] to provide an accounting of the trust to the court. In 2008, Robertson <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/federal-judge-awards-native-americans.php">rejected</a> plaintiffs' claims that the government had engaged in fraud, but <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-interior-department-unreasonably.php">held</a> [JURIST reports] that the DOI "unreasonably delayed" the accounting of billions of dollars of American Indian money. The case <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/century-old-american-indian-trust-claim.php">went to trial</a> in June 2008, after the plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/indian-trust-plaintiffs-reject-7.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] a 2007 settlement proposal from the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Alvin Hellerstein <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-cia-not-in-contempt-for-interrogation-videotape-destruction.php">previously ruled</a> [JURIST report] on this issue in August. The case against the CIA, brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], sought a variety of forms of relief including an order requiring the individuals responsible for the destruction to be identified as well as an order that the agency be held in contempt. Hellerstein however, finding that the plaintiffs had already received sufficient remedial relief, denied all requests with the exception of attorneys' fees and costs. In support of his decision, Hellerstein distinguished between civil contempt, the purpose of which is to coerce future compliance, and remedy past noncompliance and criminal contempt, which serves to punish the violator. In holding that these goals had already been achieved and no further action was required, the judge cited the CIA's "massive production" of documents related to the videotapes' destruction and its recent adoption of new protocols to insure against similar incidents in the future. Regarding the protocols, Hellerstein wrote:<blockquote>In my opinion, contrary to plaintiff's view, the CIA's new protocols would have a remedial and deterrent effect should a CIA official think to destroy documents. The protocols should lead to better communication and more complete written records within the Agency and across the government when an issue of document destruction or retention arises within the Agency. The CIA's new protocols should lead to greater accountability within the Agency and prevent another episode like the videotapes' destruction.</blockquote>Hellerstein also determined the ruling was appropriate given the possibility that the individuals responsible for destroying the tapes may not have been aware of the court orders requiring production.

<p>In January, Hellerstein told the CIA that it must <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-tells-cia-to-investigate-destruction-of-interrogation-tapes.php">investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes</a> [JURIST report] and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Internal CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] released last year reveal that the former head of the agency Porter Goss may have <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">agreed to the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of the interrogation <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to redacted <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] filed in March 2009, 12 of 92 videotapes <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destroyed by the CIA</a> [JURIST report] contained evidence of "enhanced interrogation techniques." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">acknowledged</a> [letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">report</a>] in March 2009 that the CIA destroyed 92 videotapes of high value terrorism suspect interrogations, in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information. The August 2008 order came in response to a December 2007 ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/aclu_v_dod_memo_contemptmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA be held in contempt of court for not providing information on the tapes during a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/accountability/released.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the organization in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sirleaf, known as the "Iron Lady," is the <a href="http://www.emansion.gov.lr/content.php?sub=President%27s%20Biography&related=The%20President">president of Liberia</a> [official profile] and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4395978.stm">first woman elected to head of state in Africa</a> [BBC profile]. <a href="http://www.huntalternatives.org/pages/7352_leymah_gbowee.cfm">Gbowee</a> [Hunt Alternatives Fund backgrounder] is a founder and the executive director of the <a href="http://www.wipsen-africa.org/wipsen/about/?lang=en-us">Women Peace and Security Network Africa</a> [advocacy website] and is credited with <a href="http://www.myhero.com/go/hero.asp?hero=womens_peace_movement_liberia_08">organizing a peace movement</a> [My Hero backgrounder] which eventually ended the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/liberia-1997.htm">Second Liberian Civil War</a> [Global Security backgrounder]. Karman, the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hcPkEHWGEeeLGSH5B_aCVcw40hmA?docId=9574cc7b4967457ca73feef9975bfe2d">first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize</a> [AP report], is a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2049476,00.html">Yemeni activist</a> [TIME backgrounder] and chairwoman of <a href="http://womenpress.org/index.php?lng=english">Women Journalists Without Chains</a> [advocacy website]. The Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjorn Jagland, stated that the purpose of <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=1628">giving the award to the three women's rights activists</a> [video] was to bring more attention to violence against women and to encourage women to have a greater role in "peace processes and peace building." He further stated that this was intended to be a "strong signal to the Arab world."

<p>Despite her work in the area of women's rights, Sirleaf has become a controversial figure in African politics. Unemployment in Liberia is still at <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/201110794610186521.html">80 percent</a> [Al Jazeera report], and political opponents have accused her of using government money to fund her campaign, which she denies. Further, the <a href="http://trcofliberia.org/">Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Libera</a> [official website] recommended in 2009 that Sirleaf be subject to sanctions and a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/libera-truth-commission-recommends-30.php">30-year ban on holding public office</a> [JURIST report] for providing financial support to former Liberian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2963086.stm">Charles Taylor</a> [BBS profile]. Sirleaf was one of 50 individuals named in the report. Jagland stated that Karman was awarded one-third of the prize in order to associate some of the money with the uprisings sweeping through the Arab world, called the Arab Spring. Karman strongly opposes Yemeni <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=\%22Ali+Abdullah+Saleh\%22">news archive</a>], but has controversial ties to <a href="http://www.projectyemen.org/2011/04/ramblings-on-islah-party.html">Islah</a> [Project Yemen backgrounder], a party whose chief member is Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, a former adviser to <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin-Laden</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires school officials to verify the immigration status of children and parents, authorizes police to detain an individual and ask for papers if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" that the driver is in the country illegally, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. The DOJ argues that the "state regime contravenes the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration" and that:<blockquote>H.B. 56 creates a panoply of new state offenses that criminalize, among other things, an alien's failure to comply with federal registration requirements that were enacted pursuant to Congress's exclusive power to regulate immigration, an alien's attempt to solicit or perform work, and an alien's attempt to interact with state or local government. The law also invites discrimination against many foreign-born citizens and lawfully present aliens, including legal residents, by making it a crime for any landlord to rent housing to an unlawfully present alien, invalidating all contracts with unlawfully present aliens, and even targeting school-age children with an alien registration system.</blockquote>Two similar motions for injunction were denied by the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">earlier this week</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">last month</a> [JURIST reports]. Alabama state officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">defend the law</a> [JURIST report] and argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law and that the text reflects a "spirit of cooperation with the federal government." The state officials point out that the law contains mechanisms safeguarding against unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and allegations suggesting provisions of the law would deter students from enrolling in school are speculative.

<p>The DOJ, joined by several rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-immigration-law.php">appeared before the court in August</a> [JURIST report] to make arguments against the law's enactment, at which point Chief Justice Sharon Lovelace Blackburn issued the temporary injunction to forestall enactment of the challenged provisions while she evaluated their contention with federal statute. Religious groups and representatives of several rights groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC), the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] have stated that the Alabama law is the most extreme of the recent state anti-immigration laws influenced by controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=SB+1070">Arizona SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive]. From when the legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST reports] in June, 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Livini risked arrest after an <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/_cps_statement_in_relation_to_ms_livni_s_visit/">application was made</a> [press statement] on Tuesday to the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> (DPP) [official profile], seeking his consent to a private prosecutor for a warrant to arrest her based on war crimes charges relating to Israel's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaza">Gaza Offensive</a> [JURIST news archive]. A Palestinian police officer whose brother was killed in the attacks on Gaza, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/06/tzipi-livni-war-crime-arrest-threat">submitted the application</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], which was supported by a "body of information" requested by the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) [official website]. However, according to the CPS, this information, though carefully considered, was still not sufficient to support a "realistic prospect of conviction against Ms. Livini in relation to the alleged offenses." Additionally, the CPS received a certificate indicating that the FCO had consented to the visit as a "special mission," a designation that the High Court ruled a court was not able to call into question. As a result, Livini was able to <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&id=665349482">complete her visit</a> [FCO news report] with Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss UK-Israel relations. A previous trip scheduled for December 2009 was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on the war crimes charges.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website]<a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-passes-law-limiting-arrests-under-universal-jurisdiction.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/policereformandsocialresponsibility.html">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act</a> [materials], which makes it more difficult for ordinary citizens to obtain arrest warrants for suspected war criminals present in the UK. The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/09/16/uk_alters_law_targeting_war_crimes_suspects/">controversial act</a> [AP report] removes the exclusive power of granting arrest warrants from local magistrates, requiring that all such warrants receive approval from the DPP. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke of the UK Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press-releases/moj/pressrelease150911a.htm">said</a> [press release] about the bill, "[w]e are clear about our international obligations and these new changes to existing law will ensure the balance is struck between ensuring those who are accused of such heinous crimes do not escape justice and that universal jurisdiction cases are only proceeded with on the basis of solid evidence that is likely to lead to a successful prosecution." The amendment is seen as a move by the UK government to improve relations with foreign countries such as China and Israel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Officials <a href="http://nigerianobservernews.com/07102011/news/news1.html">arrested</a> [<em>Nigerian Observer</em> report] former Ogun state governor Gbenga Daniel, former Oyo state governor Adebayo Alao-Akala and former Nasarawa state governor Ali Akwe Doma for interrogation purposes. The arrests were in response to petitions filed by citizens to EFCC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15208522">alleging</a> [BBC report] that the former leaders abused state contracts and used government money for personal purposes. The ex-governors are expected to be in court within the next few days.

<p>In August, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-ineffective-hrw.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that corruption in the Nigerian government has become endemic and criticized the EFCC for ineffective practices, including slow-moving trials and small sentences. Earlier in August, the Nigerian Ebonyi State Commissioner of Justice and Attorney General, Ben Igwenyi, called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-official-calls-for-special-corruption-court.php">establishment of a special court to hear corruption cases</a> [JURIST report]. He argued that corruption cases in the regular courts take too long to process, causing people to forget about them and perpetuating the appearance of corruption in the government. He proposed merging the <a href="http://www.icpc.gov.ng/">Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission</a> (ICPC) [official website], which investigates corruption, and the EFCC to form an anti-corruption court. Corruption remains a problem in Nigeria as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-arrests-outgoing-house-speaker-on-fraud-allegations.php">EFCC arrested</a> [JURIST report] outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole in June on allegations of fraud. He is believed to have secured a USD $ 66 million loan on top of his normal salary. In March, HRW and the <a href="http://www.nba.org.ng/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [association website] called for Nigeria's National Assembly to pass legislation <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/13/nigeria-pass-bill-prosecute-electoral-abuses">creating a special electoral offenses commission</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nigeria-legislature-urged-to-create-special-electoral-offences-commission.php">report</a>] tasked with investigating and prosecuting election-related abuses, including violence. In 2006, then Nigerian vice president Atiku Abubakar was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/nigerian-vp-charged-with-corruption.php">charged with more than a dozen counts of corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the Code of Conduct Tribunal, a special corruption court that has the power to strip elected officials of immunity.

The EPA unveiled stricter guidelines in 2009 to issue permits to companies who sought to dump fill material from the removal mining into streams. The <a href="http://www.nma.org/#">National Mining Association</a> (NMA) and several other plaintiffs, including the <a href="http://www.dep.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection</a> (DEP) [official websites], filed suit in 2010, alleging that the EPA exceeded its authority under <a href="http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/sec404.cfm">section 404 of the Clean Water Act</a> [text] by overstepping its role in the permitting process, which is largely handled by the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official website]. The plaintiffs further argued that the EPA violated the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text] when it did not allow for notice and comment procedures in its rulemaking process.  The court ordered that the 2009 guidelines be set aside and that all permitting be handled via the pre-2009 guidelines.  West Virginia Governor <a href="http://www.governor.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Earl Ray Tomblin</a> (D) [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.wv.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/Pages/GovernorTomblinApplaudsUSDistrictCourtRulinginFavorofWestVirginiainMiningSuit.aspx">applauded</a> [press release] the court's decision, stating that the decision "confirmed [the state's] assertions against the EPA." The EPA <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576615952136449630.html">dismissed the decision</a> [WSJ report] as "procedural" and assured families in Appalachia that it did not affect the agency's authority under the Clean Water Act to protect public health.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/house-passes-bill-requiring-analysis-of-proposed-epa-regulations.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would effectively block a number of proposed EPA regulations aimed at reducing emissions.  The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2401eh/pdf/BILLS-112hr2401eh.pdf">Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation Act 2011</a> would require the formation of a committee to perform economic impact analyses prior to promulgating any regulations. The possible effects to the economy of environmental regulations have made their passage and implementation difficult as of late. Earlier in September, Obama requested the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/obama-overturns-epa-smog-standards.php">withdrawal of national smog standards</a> [JURIST report] proposed by the EPA. The draft <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html">Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> [materials] would have reduced the amount of smog emissions to between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million (ppm) from the previous 0.075 ppm. The EPA estimates that these changes would help reduce the effects of climate change and improve public health, saving the US between $13 billion and $100 billion in health care costs. The stricter smog standards, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/epa-proposes-stricter-smog-regulations.php">proposed by the EPA in January 2010</a> [JURIST report], would have replaced the Bush administration's broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. In his statement, Obama recognized recent efforts to improve environmental protection, but emphasized the need to trim down regulations in light of the economic downturn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

CHRD confirmed that Liu was released to attend his father's funeral, and was temporarily reunited with his wife. The groups contend this was done to deflect criticism on the eve of the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/nobel-peace-prize-awarded-to-womens-rights-activists.php">2011 Nobel peace prize</a> [JURIST report]. The CHRD reported that China is attempting to legalize secret detentions.<blockquote>To ensure that the law cannot be used as a shield to protect these activists from the state's arbitrary power, in August 2011 the Chinese government announced plans that would effectively legalize the practice of enforced disappearance. Among the wide-ranging proposed revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law (CPL), one of the most alarming changes is Article 73 of the draft, which governs the use of "residential surveillance" by the police. Instead of being detained in their homes as in ordinary cases, suspects accused of "endangering state security, terrorist crimes and major bribery crimes" could be held in "a specified residence." Similarly, police could subject suspects charged with "endangering state security and terrorist crimes" to residential surveillance without having to notify their families within 24 hours, as required in ordinary cases.</blockquote>
HRW asked that all governments attending the Nobel prize ceremony this year use it as a venue to call for China to release Liu and other political prisoners.

<p>Liu has been one of China's most prominent dissidents. He spent two years in prison following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] uprising, has long challenged China's one-party rule and co-authored <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=89851&item_id=85717">Charter 08</a> [text], a petition calling for political reforms in the country. International organizations have been rallying for Liu's release since he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a> [JURIST reports] in November. In August, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Liu, according to UN documents obtained by <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/">Freedom Now</a> [advocacy website]. The documents said that the Chinese government responded by saying the conviction was in accordance with Chinese criminal codes and consistent with the rule of law. Last December, Liu was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-awarded-nobel-peace-prize-in-absentia.php">awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway. The Chinese government denounced the decision calling it "contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Prize," and censoring the announcement, blocking internet searches and international broadcasts about it and even turning off phones of people who text messaged the news.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wyden called for the US to sanction Bahrain for their human rights abuses in the face of peaceful revolution: <blockquote>Selling weapons to a regime that is violently suppressing peaceful civil dissent and violating human rights is antithetical to our foreign policy goals and the principle of basic rights for all that the U.S. has worked hard to promote. The Arab Spring has encouraged the citizens of Bahrain to seek those same rights from their government and the U.S. should not reward a regime that actively suppresses its people. This resolution will withhold the sale of arms to Bahrain until the ruling family shows a real commitment to human rights.</blockquote>The resolution has a number of stipulations for Bahrain to meet before arms sales can continue, including investigating human rights abuse allegations, ending torture and denial of medical aid, protecting the Shiite culture and religion and submitting to outside investigations and journalist inquiries. A vote has not been scheduled for the resolution, which must be passed by October 14 to stop the sale.

<p>The situation in Bahrain continues to deteriorate. On Tuesday, a Bahrain civilian-military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-military-court-sentences-protesters-students.php">sentenced 26 protesters to prison terms</a> [JURIST report] ranging from 5-15 years, bringing the total number of protesters sentenced in the past week to 60. Those who were sentenced on Tuesday include prominent members of the Shiite political group who were among hundreds of protesters seeking greater rights for the Shiite majority. On Monday, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-military-court-sentences-protesters-students.php">nearly 40 protesters were sentenced</a> [JURIST report], including university students, to sentences of 15-25 years for crimes ranging from rioting to attempted murder. Last week, the National Safety Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] one anti-government protester to death for killing a police officer and gave lengthy prison sentences to medical personnel, including doctors, for providing treatment to injured protesters during the country's uprising. <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations.

Under AB 131, high achieving students who are in the process of applying for citizenship are eligible to receive financial aid for college. The newly enacted law builds on AB 130, signed into law by Governor Brown on July 25, 2011, which made financial aid from private sources available to the same group of students. The former law required undocumented students to pay nonresident tuition at California Community Colleges and the California State University unless they were nonimmigrant aliens who attended high school in California for at least three years and graduated from a California high school or its equivalent. The former law also covered aliens without lawful immigration status if they filed a prescribed affidavit. The Dream Act amends the Donahue Higher Education Act to establish procedures that enable students who are exempt from paying nonresident tuition to apply for, and participate in, all student aid programs to the full extent that federal law permits. 

<p>Immigration has been a divisive issue across the US. In August, President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/us-to-review-deportations-in-300000-immigration-cases.php">major reforms</a> [JURIST report] to the US's current immigration system, putting 300,000 illegal immigrants' cases up for review and temporarily halting their deportation. Many of the criteria allowing immigrants to stay in this country mirror portions of the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3992:#">Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act</a> [materials], which has languished in Congress for a decade. It attempts to provide amnesty for illegal immigrants who serve in the military or achieve a college education. Also in August, the Casa de Maryland immigrant rights group filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/immigrant-rights-group-challenges-public-referendum-to-overturn-maryland-dream-act.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] to a public referendum over a Maryland law providing in-state tuition to undocumented college students. The group filed the challenge in the Maryland <a href="http://www.circuitcourt.org/">Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County</a> [official website] after opponents of the Maryland <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/bills/sb/sb0167f.pdf">DREAM Act</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/billfile/sb0167.htm">materials</a>] collected enough signatures to put the law to a public referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The memo last year followed months of legal debate regarding the decision to kill a US citizen without first having a trial. The secret document written by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http:/http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Memo-made-legal-case-for-killing-2209696.php#ixzz1aIH3A85a">justified the decision</a> [NYT report] to kill al-Awlaki despite an executive order banning assassinations and a federal law against murder. The memo may serve to resolve the legal debate and respond to public criticism over whether the president can order the killing of US citizens abroad as part of a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/aulaqi-killing-reignites-debate-on-limits-of-executive-power/2011/09/30/gIQAx1bUAL_story.html">counterterrorism measure</a> [WP report]. The document may also serve as justification for allowing the US military and CIA to kill an American overseas based on the written approval from the DOJ. The Obama Administration still has not discussed its role in the drone attack killing al-Awlaki.

<p>Al-Awlaki was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed by a CIA drone strike</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen on September 30. The strike marks the US government's most successful attack against al Qaeda since the raid leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan last May. The US-born radical Muslim cleric reportedly used his English and Internet skills to recruit individuals for attacks in the US. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] criticized the targeted killing as a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-statement-killing-anwar-al-aulaqi">violation of both US and international law</a> [press release]. The US has increased drone strikes in Yemen to try and reduce al Qaeda's power in the region and minimize the chaos spilling over the border into Saudi Arabia. The US targeted Awlaki in a strike last May but missed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, introduced by <a href="http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/">Senator Ed Hernandez</a> [official website], would have <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2011/10/08/brown-vetoes-affirmative-action-like-sb-185/">effectively overturned</a> [Daily Californian report] ballot measure <a href="http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/209text.htm">Proposition 209</a> [text], which banned the use of affirmative action for state hiring, contracting, or university admission. The Governor said in his veto message to the Senate that <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/255463-browns-sb-185-veto-message.html">although he agreed with the purpose</a> [statement, PDF] of the bill, it is the role of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to decide the boundaries of Proposition 209: <blockquote>I wholeheartedly agree with the goal of this legislation.... But while I agree with this legislation, I must return the bill without my signature. Our constitutional system of separation of powers requires that the courts -- not the Legislature -- determine the limits of Proposition 209.... Signing this bill is unlikely to impact how Proposition 209 is ultimately interpreted by the courts; it will just encourage the 209 advocates to file more costly and confusing lawsuits.</blockquote> The Governor previously <a href="http://equaljusticesociety.org/email/AG_LetterBrief_209_20090422.pdf">contested</a> [opinion letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/california-ag-calls-amendment-banning.php">report</a>] Proposition 209 in 2009. The Berkeley College Republicans at the <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">University of California Berkeley</a> [academic website] released a <a href="http://www.berkeleycollegerepublicans.com/veto.html">statement praising</a> [press release] the Governor's veto. The veto comes on the same day Governor Brown signed into law a bill allowing undocumented immigrants to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/california-governer-signs-law-providing-financial-aid-to-undocumented-students.php">receive financial aid</a> [JURIST report] for college. 

<p>Affirmative action continues to be a controversial issue. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-to-conduct-rehearing-on-michigan-affirmative-action-ban.php">rehearing <em>en banc</em></a> [JURIST report] to determine the constitutionality of an amendment to the Michigan Constitution banning affirmative action. In January, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously ruled to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-appeals-court-upholds-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">uphold the affirmative action</a> [JURIST report] policy of considering race in student admissions at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> (UT) [academic website]. In August of 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] held that a state ban on preferential hiring practices for minorities and women <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-high-court-rules-affirmative-action-ban-constitutional.php">does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a> [text]. In November 2008, Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ballot-measure-fails.php">voters narrowly rejected</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/main.htm">ballot measure</a> [Amendment 46 text and materials] to prohibit governmental agencies from discriminating or granting preferences on the basis of race and sex.

UN officials also expressed concern for civilians who have chosen to remain in Sirte, which is seeing heavy street fighting, and have urged the continuance of medical aid and help by local communities and charities.  

<p>Harm to the civilian population has been a concern throughout the Libyan conflict. In August, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-africa-12698562">Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi</a> [BBC backgrounder] requested that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">UN create a "high-level commission"</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/20/us-libya-un-idUSTRE77J1SC20110820">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [Reuters report] by <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] forces.  Although NATO was mandated by the UN to use force in order to stop Muammar Gaddafi from fomenting violence upon Libyan citizens, the campaign has allegedly gone beyond the scope of protecting civilians and recently led to the death of 85 civilians in one night after NATO forces bombed a residential area supposedly housing a rebel command center. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports] claiming Libyan authorities committed crimes against humanity, "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>

Cambodian government officials have put pressure on the international court to turn the cases over to Cambodia, with the Cambodian foreign minister purportedly stating, "On the issue of the arrest of more Khmer Rouge leaders, this is a Cambodian issue. ... This issue must be decided by Cambodia." ECCC Judge Siegfried Blunk resigned from the panel of judges in an effort to maintain the "integrity of the whole proceedings," though he indicated that he would not have been influenced by such statements. Both Blunk and co-judge You Bunleng of Cambodia have been criticized for allegedly failing to conduct impartial investigations. Last week, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/human-rights-watch-calls-for-resignation-of-judges-in-cambodia-genocide-investigation.php">demanded the resignation</a> [JURIST report] of the two judges responsible for indictments at the Cambodian tribunal on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Khmer+Rouge%22">news archive</a>] war crimes. In April 2011, the judges declared that they had concluded their investigation into <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">Case 003</a> [materials] and a formal closing order is expected to be issued soon. The judges are also expected to close and dismiss <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">Case 004</a> [materials]. Should closing orders be issued in either case, the prosecutor can appeal to the pre-trial chamber. 

<p>In July, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-denies-reports-it-ordered-close-of-cambodia-genocide-investigation.php">UN denied reports</a> [JURIST report] it instructed the ECCC to close further investigations into war crimes committed under the Khmer Rouge regime after the controversial closing of Case 003. Doubts about the legitimacy and independence of the ECCC have been raised since the decision to close ECCC Case 003. In May, a coalition of more than 30 rights groups and development organizations in Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-urge-more-transparency-for-khmer-rouge-tribunal.php">issued an open letter</a> [JURIST report] urging the ECCC to embrace a greater degree of transparency. Earlier that week, ECCC judges ordered Co-Prosecutor Andrew Cayley to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eccc-judges-order-prosecutor-to-retract-statement-demanding-further-investigation-into-khmer-rouge-s.php">retract public statements requesting further investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Case 003. Cayley said the information was released pursuant to tribunal rules "to ensure that the public is duly informed about ongoing ECCC proceedings." The judges, however, said Cayley breached the tribunal's confidentiality and ordered the retraction. The only ECCC conviction since its founding in 2006 is of <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/1">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], better known as "Duch," a former prison chief at the notorious Toul Sleng prison under the Khmer Rouge. In March, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-khmer-rouge-official-in-court-to-appeal-war-crimes-convictions.php">appealed</a> his 35-year sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">handed down by the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports] last July. The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for the deaths of some <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">1.7 million people</a> [PPU backgrounder] from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The prisoners interviewed for the study had been detained by the National Directorate of Security (NDS) or Afghan
National Police (ANP) forces for national security crimes. Nearly half of the 273 detainees interviewed reported that they had undergone interrogation that amounted to torture. UNAMA also alleged that NDS and ANP officials committed due process violations and arbitrarily detained arrestees but did acknowledge that the abuse was not the result of official government policy. The report contends that torture and arbitrary detention undermine reconciliation and reintegration of former Taliban members into Afghan society and compromises national security:<blockquote>Torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detention by the NDS and ANP are not only serious violations of human rights and crimes they also pose obstacles to reconciliation and reintegration processes aimed at ending the armed conflict in Afghanistan. UNAMA's research along with the findings of other experts who have analysed the emergence and growth of the insurgency post-2001, highlights that such abuses in many cases contributed to individual victims joining or rejoining the Taliban and other anti-Government armed groups.</blockquote>UNAMA recommended that the Afghan government, the NDS and ANP adopt and implement measures to reduce abuse in detention facilities.

<p>Afghanistan has received much criticism for its human rights record. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported in September that the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">committing serious abuses</a> [JURIST report], and the Afghan government is doing little to hold the officials accountable. Corruption, abuse of power and a focus on short-term security goals in Afghanistan have <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensified the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report] affecting more than two-thirds of the population, according to a March 2010 <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/SPdocs/Countries/AF/PovertyReport_30032010.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] from the UN's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website].

The attacks resulted in 166 deaths, including nine other gunmen. Kasab carried out the attack on the train station which killed 52 people. Two alleged Indian accomplices tried with Kasab were acquitted on all charges of helping to plan the attacks. Kasab is the only surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks.

The new decree will have an immediate effect on the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=26508">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] whose traditional slogan, "Islam is the solution," will be banned under the new electoral guidelines. A Muslim Brotherhood official noted that while the "[t]he slogan is a way of life for us ... it isn't necessarily an electoral slogan." However, the official also said the Muslim Brotherhood leadership is reconsidering their use of the phrase. Voting in a parliamentary election starts in the country on November 28.

<p>In March, Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-to-lift-state-of-emergency-before-september-election.php">lift the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] before parliamentary polls were to be held.

Section 112 of the <a href="http://www.samuiforsale.com/Law-Texts/thailand-penal-code.html">Thai Penal Code</a> [text] says that "whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir to the throne or the Regent shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." The statement came after Thai-born US citizen Joe Gordon pleaded guilty Monday to defaming the royal family by translating excerpts of a locally banned book and posting them online. La Rue also condemned the country's 2007 <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/117">Computer Crimes Act</a> [unofficial text], which imposes a prison sentence of up to five years for any views expressed on the Internet in relation to the monarchy deemed to be a threat to national security. The Act is used to further enforce the country's insult law, La Rue said, "[t]he threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression. ... This is exacerbated by the fact that the charges can be brought by private individuals and trials are often closed to the public."

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-condemns-closed-thailand.php">public trial</a> [JURIST report] for a Thai political activist accused of lese majeste, or insulting the royal family. Judge Prommat Toosang <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/1261">ordered</a> [Reuters report] that the trial of <a href="http://thaipoliticalprisoners.wordpress.com/decidedcases/darunee-charnchoensilpakul/">Darunee Charnchoengsilpakul</a> [advocacy website] be closed for national security reasons. AI's Asia-Pacific director Sam Zarifi noted that although the closure of trials is legitimate under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Thai Constitution, the government "will have a very difficult time explaining why the trial of someone charged with making an insulting remark could compromise Thailand's national security." Zafiri said that Prommat's guarantee of a fair trial was inadequate and "simply not verifiable" unless the trial is conducted in public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A full year after the report was published, <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2011/10/10/Rights-violations-ignored-in-DRC/UPI-31921318265214/">detailing over 600 violations of international law</a> [UPI report], HRW says there has been not be sufficient follow-up by African governments or the UN. HRW Africa director Daniel Bekele called for action:<blockquote>With the best will in the world, the Congolese government cannot deal with the legacy of the country's massive abuses alone. The crimes committed in Congo involved border-crossing perpetrators, placing responsibilities on many governments to ensure that justice is done. ... While some of the incidents covered in the mapping report were well known, the compilation of so many atrocities into one report was a shocking wake-up call. All concerned governments, as well as those named, should ensure that the report is not simply shelved, and take action on its findings.</blockquote>HRW indicated its support for the establishment of a specialized mixed court, with jurisdiction over past and current serious international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, committed in Congo.

<p>Rights groups have consistently called for more accountability for human rights abuses in the DRC. In August, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for justice system reform in the DRC. The <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR62/006/2011/en/6cd862df-be60-418e-b70d-7d2d53a0a2d4/afr620062011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] stated that the justice system has allowed the Congolese army and other armed groups to engage in a "cycle of violence and human rights violations for decades," alleging that the groups have engaged in torture, sexual violence and murder against citizens and that very few perpetrators have been brought to justice. In July, the <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in DR Congo</a> (MONUSCO) in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHROReportMassRapesBushani_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] accusing soldiers in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) of <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-drc-to-prosecute-perpetrators-of-mass-rapes.php">committing mass rape</a> [JURIST report]. The report is the first to officially provide evidence that national forces perpetrated mass rape, as opposed to reports of <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rape-being-used-as-weapon-of-war-in-drc.php">opposition forces using it as a weapon</a> [JURIST report]. In May, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-urges-drc-to-strengthen-rule-of-law.php">called for continued reforms</a> [JURIST report] in the DRC in order to strengthen the country's rule of law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Presenting her <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/439/45/PDF/N1143945.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] on the pervasive, widespread violence against women throughout the world and its causes and consequences, Manjoo <a href="http://ftpapp.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158719&Itemid=2">reminded states</a> [APP report] of their international human rights obligation to protect women from all manifestations of discrimination, whether it be from violence, inequality or oppression.  Though there has been an increase in women's educational enrollment and employment opportunities and progress made in repealing some discriminatory legislation, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39994&Cr=&Cr1=">there is a lot left to be accomplished</a> [UN News Centre report] in order "to ensure their full enjoyment by all women and girls worldwide." Also discussed during the session was a wide range of other forms of discrimination, from sexual violence such as genital mutilation to under-representation of women in corporate executive positions: <blockquote>Throughout the world, violence against women is pervasive, widespread and unacceptable. Rooted in multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and inequalities, and strongly linked to the social and economic situation of women, violence against women constitutes a continuum of exploitation and abuse. Whether it occurs in times of conflict, post conflict or so called peace, the various forms and manifestations of violence against women are simultaneously causes and consequences of discrimination, inequality and oppression. </blockquote>Manjoo's presentation follows her earlier request for the US government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-condemns-us-domestic-violence-laws.php">reevaluate its domestic violence policies</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Equality and women's rights continue to be an issue for much of the world. Manjoo also released a report in June that said there is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">continued prevalence of violence and discriminatory treatment of women in the US</a> [JURIST report], with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. In March, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Tunisia and Egypt to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection and to include women in the dialogue to shape the future of their countries. In January, a US Military panel <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that women should be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women's-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">Afghan government to protect the rights of women</a> [JURIST report] during integration and reconciliation efforts conducted with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and other militants. Earlier in 2010, India's upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsweb.asp">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-upper-house-approves-quota-for.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that one-third of seats in parliament are reserved for women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mladic is awaiting trial at the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on charges of genocide and war crimes allegedly committed during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICTY confirmed that Mladic is <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE79A12U20111011?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">receiving medical treatment</a> [Reuters report], but it could not confirm the reason for the hospitalization. Mladic has complained of ill health since his trial began, prompting officials to propose splitting the case in two in order to accelerate the pace of the proceedings. It is not immediately clear what this hospitalization will mean for the proceedings. 

<p>Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During his appearance at the ICTY in July he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">removed from the courtroom</a> [JURIST report] for disrupting the proceedings. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. He <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a> and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports] in early June. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for allegedly ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya's party, "Construction and Development," should be allowed to participate in the elections because its founders consist of Muslims and non-Muslims and the party does not mandate the religion of its members.  

<p>While the decision marks progress in Egypt's journey towards democratic rule, certain election prohibitions continue to restrict its progress.

The report also includes a number of recommendations to the country aimed at improving its human rights record which has been widely criticized since the country began to crackdown on anti-government protests early this year. In statements contained in the report, Syria asserts that the violence in the country is the result of "terrorist threats" prompted by "a media war" and "the hegemony of the West, the US and Israel." The government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile] has continued to crack down on anti-government protests in the country, killing and estimated 3,000 civilians since mid-March.

<p>Last month, the UNHRC voted 33-4 to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-council-adopts-syria-probe-resolution.php">adopt a resolution</a> [JURIST report] ordering an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39357&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">investigation</a> [press release] into crimes against humanity in Syria and urging the Syrian government once again to halt its violent crackdown against peaceful protesters. An emergency meeting was held in <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">response to a plea</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] to refer Syria to the ICC for an investigation into the violent suppression of anti-government protests. Many steps have been taken to try and halt the violence in Syria. In August, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. In July, two UN rights officials expressed <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. In June, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] published a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year. In April, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">urged Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1320.htm">Blueford v. Arkansas</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Brief-06-01-11-183223.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Double_jeopardy">Double Jeopardy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clause prevents the re-prosecution of a greater offense after the jury announces voting for a not guilty verdict, if a jury deadlocks on a lesser-included offense. Alex Blueford contends that jeopardy attached to the jury's determination that he is not guilty of capital murder and its lesser-included offense of first-degree murder. The Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="http://opinions.aoc.arkansas.gov/WebLink8/0/doc/54184/Electronic.aspx">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the order denying Blueford's motions to prevent his retrial on the charge of capital murder and its lesser-included offenses.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1042.htm">Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Freeman-CERT-PETITION.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether Section 8(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_12_10_27.html">Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act</a> (RESPA) [text] prohibits a real estate settlement services provider from only charging an unearned fee when the fee is divided between two or more parties. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-30902-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the RESPA prohibits only kickbacks and referral fees, not unearned fees by a sole provider of settlement services. Therefore, charges that Quicken imposed on the appellants for loan discount fees and a loan processing fee are not prohibited by Section 8(b) of the RESPA.</p>

<p>Also Tuesday, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-46.htm">Adar v. Smith</a> [docket; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-asked-to-review-putting-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">report</a>], in which a same-sex couple wants both their names on the birth certificate of an adopted child. The issue presented was whether denying non-married couples from having both names appear on an adopted child's birth certificate is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. </p>

<p>The court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101111zor.pdf">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a> [docket; JURIST <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/hot_topics/13796702.html?c=r">backgrounder</a>], letting stand the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-grants-new-sentencing-for-mumia.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] granting a new sentencing hearing for Abu-Jamal. Abu-Jamal is a former member of the Black Panthers who was convicted and sentenced to death for killing a police officer in Philadelphia in 1981.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Rodion Kireyev also barred Tymoshenko from serving public office for three years and ruled in favor of a 1.5 billion hryvnias judgment against her. Despite the conviction, international support for Tymoshenko remains strong, with many calling for her release. <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called the trial politically motivated on charges that are <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/jailed-former-ukraine-prime-minister-must-be-released-2011-10-11">not internationally recognizable offenses</a> [press release]. The <a href = "http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] announced that the treatment of Tymoshenko will have <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/xxz6m5ae">repercussions for Ukraine's EU accession</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The EU urges the competent Ukrainian authorities to ensure a fair, transparent and impartial process in any appeal in the case of Ms. Tymoshenko and in the other trials related to members of the former Government. The right of appeal should not be compromised by imposing limitations on the defendants' ability to stand in future elections in Ukraine, including the parliamentary elections scheduled for next year. The EU will reflect on its policies towards Ukraine. The way the Ukrainian authorities will generally respect universal values and rule of law, and specifically how they will handle these cases, risks having profound implications for the EU-Ukraine bilateral relationship, including for the conclusion of the Association Agreement, our political dialogue and our co-operation more broadly.</blockquote>Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/n27socn2">repeated her hope</a> [press release] that the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] would overturn the verdict and stated her <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/vn34xesv">intention to appeal</a> [press release]. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article%3Fart_id=72980&cat_id=32589">Ukrainian parliament</a> [official website] rejected four amendments to the country's <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes">Criminal Code</a> [materials] that sought to decriminalize Article 365, which <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-rejects-criminal-code-amendments-tymoshenko-still-faces-prison.php">stipulates jail time for abuse of office</a> [JURIST report]. Tymoshenko's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-prosecutors-seek-7-year-sentence-for-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">resumed</a> at the end of September after a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-trial-delayed.php">two-week recess</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, Yushchenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-president-testifies-against-former-ally-tymoshenko.php">testified against</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko, his former prime minister. That same month, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukrain</a>e (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-507.pdf">Pacific Operators Offshore LLP v. Valladolid</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-to-hear-workers-compensation-arbitration-cases.php">report</a>], the court considered when an outer continental shelf worker, injured on land, is eligible for compensation under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode43/usc_sup_01_43_10_29_20_III.html">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a> (OCSLA) [43 USC &#167;&#167; 1331-1356 text]. The OCSLA governs those who work on oil drilling platforms and other fixed structures beyond state maritime boundaries, and workers are eligible for compensation for "any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf." Juan Valladolid worked for Pacific Operations Offshore, stationed primarily on an offshore drilling platform, but was killed on the grounds of Pacific Operations' onshore oil processing facility when he was crushed by a forklift. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/05/13/08-73862.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of Valladolid's estate, explaining that the OCSLA workers' compensation provision ... applies to any injury resulting from operations on the outer continental shelf, regardless of the location of the injury. An injury is 'the result of' outer continental shelf operations if there is a substantial nexus between the injury and the operations." Pacific Operators Offshore argued that the OCSLA has no remedy for an injury that occurred on dry land, but rather Valladolid should have sought relief through state workers compensation law. The federal government argued that the OCSLA covers injuries or death on dry land explicitly, but not under the "nexus" reasoning the Ninth Circuit utilized. Valladolid's attorney argued that, pursuant to similar treatment in the <A href = "http://www.1800jonesact.com/maritime_statutes/default.html">Jones Act</a> [text], his client's estate should be compensated for his death that occurred on land. Justice Samuel Alito noted that although the death arrived out of the work, all three parties only wanted to focus on the location: "The curious thing about this case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak quite clearly to some theory of causation. Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some&#8212;some species of causation. Any injury occurring as a result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf, that's&#8212;that's causation. And yet nobody wants this really to be&#8212;neither you nor your adversary nor the government wants this to be a&#8212;to be based on causation. Everyone wants to smuggle something else into&#8212;into here&#8212;into this."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-948.pdf">CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-to-hear-jerusalem-passport-arbitration-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether claims arising under the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/croa/croa.shtm">Credit Repair Organizations Act</a> [15 USC &#167; 1679 et seq.] are subject to arbitration pursuant to a valid arbitration agreement. The case arises from a dispute between consumers and companies that issue low-rate credit cards to people with bad credit. The consumers filed a lawsuit over credit card fees, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that they had a right to sue in federal court rather than face arbitration. The attorney for CompuCredit argued that strong federal policy in favor of arbitration overrides any differing laws that discourage waivers of rights to sue. Respondents argued that the Credit Repair Organizations Act explicitly bans any suggestion of waiving the right to sue, and that credit card companies should be fined for even asking applicants to sign an arbitration waiver.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-637.pdf">Greene v. Fisher</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments surrounding the "clearly established federal law" standard under <a href="http://www.capdefnet.org/codes/28_usc_2254.htm">28 USC &#167; 2254(d)</a> [text], as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Petitioner Eric Greene was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in a robbery of a convenience store in which the store's owner was shot and killed. At the trial, Greene objected to the admission of confessions of his conspirators and co-defendants on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause</a> [Sixth Amendment text] grounds. The court allowed the confessions with Greene's name redacted. He renewed this objection on appeal, arguing on the grounds of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-8653.ZS.html">Gray v. Maryland</a> [text], where a similarly redacted confession was deemed inadmissible. Gray was decided before Greene's conviction became final but after the state court's last decision on the merits. The Third Circuit held that an opinion issued after a decision on the merits in state court is not "clearly established federal Law." Greene's attorney argued that it was a bedrock rule that prisoners should benefit from any ruling made before "finality." The attorney for Pennsylvania argued that Greene asking for law that had been decided after "finality" was asking for new facts to be applied, and thus inapplicable: "For the proposition that our case has emphasized that review under 2254(d)1 focuses on what a State court knew and did. State court decisions are measured against this Court's precedent as of the time the State court renders its decision. The jumping off point, so to speak, for the Court's extension of the principle the effect that we are debating today to the area of new facts. And I don't think there is any way to reconcile that holding with the Petitioner's argument or with the language of the statute."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gZ7GdQZKbk7IP9OS6t9-lNsAut_Q?docId=3ea4ea13a852486eb8107ba7da512074">new law specifically bars</a> [AP report] news media owners and bankers from holding financial stakes in other industries and generally bars companies from establishing a monopoly in any industry. The law provides until July 2012 for media owners and bankers to divest their interests in other industries with those in violation facing the possibility of a fine based on the amount of their investments. While the law was approved by voters in a May referendum and had little trouble passing through Congress on September 29, it has been criticized by the country's business community. In a <a href="http://www.elciudadano.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27911:ecuador-cuenta-ya-con-una-ley-antimonopolio&catid=40:actualidad&Itemid=63">radio interview</a> [audio, in Spanish], Correa articulated his support for the new law and cited the success of similar longstanding laws in the US and Chile.

<p>Correa's problems with the Ecuadorian news media stem both from his belief that they are corrupt and from a criminal libel suit he initiated earlier this year. In July, Correa <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ecuador-journalist-sentenced-in-presidential-libel-suit.php">won his criminal libel claim</a> [JURIST report] against the owners and a columnist of newspaper <em>El Universo</em>, resulting in fines of USD $40 million and a three-year sentence for the offending journalist and editors. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Emilio_Palacio">Emilio Palacio</a> [Twitter account], Nicholas Perez, Cesar Perez and Carlos Perez, the owners of <em>El Universo</em>, were personally fined $30 million in addition to their sentences, while the newspaper itself was fined $10 million for printing the article. Palacio's editorial, "No to the Lies!" was published in February 2011 and referenced an incident in September 2010 when protesting police officers fired tear gas at Correa, surrounded the hospital at which he was being treated and trapped him there for 12 hours. Palacio's editorial criticized Correa for pardoning the criminals and suggested he was doing so because the "attempted coup" was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ecuador-to-revise-austerity-law-following-unrest.php">staged to increase his political power</a> [JURIST report]. In a <a href="http://www.elciudadano.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26227:presidente-correa-se-esta-acabando-el-reino-del-terror-marcado-por-la-prensa-corrupta&catid=40:actualidad&Itemid=63">statement</a> [<em>El Ciudadano</em>, in Spanish], Correa called the suit one of his greatest legacies, and that now the Ecuadoran "corrupt press" know they cannot "damage the honor of a person."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iHVW6x3TxqfWiacB_e3W-__A16MA?docId=CNG.c12f3c43916904a6f399b9c9c858913c.871">pressure for UN action</a> [AFP report] results from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resignation of Siegfried Blunk</a> [JURIST report], one of the judges for the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website], who blamed political interference for his decision. Blunk alleged statements were made by various Cambodian officials that threatened his "ability to perform his duties independently" and more significantly, "the integrity of the whole proceedings" in the cases currently at issue. Both <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] have emphasized the need for the UN's involvement in the form of an investigation into the existence or extent of political interference at the court. 

<p>Blunk's departure is only the latest setback for the court, which has consistently faced allegations of political interference and has <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">completed only one trial</a> [JURIST report] since its inception in 2001. Last week, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/human-rights-watch-calls-for-resignation-of-judges-in-cambodia-genocide-investigation.php">demanded the resignation</a> [JURIST report] of Blunk and his counterpart You Bunleng of Cambodia, who are responsible for indictments. HRW alleges that the two investigating judges have "egregiously violated their legal and judicial duties ... [by failing] to conduct proper and good-faith investigations [in violation of] their responsibilities to act impartially." The rights group said that the two judges "failed to conduct genuine, impartial, and effective investigations into ECCC cases 003 and 004," and that as a result both of those case will likely be dropped. Both cases deal with allegations of atrocities committed under the Khmer Rouge regime. In April, the judges declared that they had concluded their investigation into <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">Case 003</a> [materials] and a formal closing order is expected to be issued soon. The judges are also expected to close and dismiss <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">Case 004</a> [materials]. Should closing orders be issued in either case, the prosecutor can appeal to the pre-trial chamber. The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for the deaths of some <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">1.7 million people</a> [PPU backgrounder] from starvation, disease, overwork and execution between 1975 and 1979.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesperson for the Ministry said at a press conference that <a href="http://www.khaama.com/afghan-officials-deny-un-report-on-prisoners-torture-697">there was no basis for the report's findings</a> [Khaama Press report] and that publicizing such information could hurt the people's trust in the police. The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/default.aspx?/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] on Monday eleased a report alleging that prisoners in some Afghan-run detention facilities have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">beaten and tortured</a> [JURIST report]. The prisoners interviewed for the study had been detained by the NDS or Afghan National Police (ANP) forces for national security crimes. Nearly half of the 273 detainees interviewed reported that they had undergone interrogation that amounted to torture. UNAMA also alleged that NDS and ANP officials committed due process violations and arbitrarily detained arrestees but did acknowledge that the abuse was not the result of official government policy.

<p>Afghanistan has received much criticism for its human rights record. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported in September that the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">committing serious abuses</a> [JURIST report], and the Afghan government is doing little to hold the officials accountable. Corruption, abuse of power and a focus on short-term security goals in Afghanistan have <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensified the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report] affecting more than two-thirds of the population, according to a March 2010 <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/SPdocs/Countries/AF/PovertyReport_30032010.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] from the UN's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Florida submitted a request to the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] Tuesday seeking declaratory judgments regarding recently-enacted <a href="http://election.dos.state.fl.us/publications/pdf/2011/2011ElectionLaws_9-20-2011.pdf">changes to the state's Election Code</a> [materials, PDF], four sections of which require <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> [DOJ backgrounder] "preclearance" under the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [materials]. Relying heavily on patterns of past discrimination to determine which state, county and local governments must obtain preclearance for election changes, the Section 5 rules require covered jurisdictions to clear changes in voting districts, polling places and other electoral processes with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] or federal courts before enactment. The four relevant sections of the Florida <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/10/11/2449471/florida-asks-judge-to-end-federal.html">voting law changes</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] reduce the number of days of early voting from 14 to eight, require voters who move from county-to-county and who update their addresses at the polls to cast provisional ballots, require third-party groups that register voters to submit forms within 48 hours or face penalties and reduce the validity of voters' signatures on initiative petitions from four years to two. Even though the provisions in question have been under review by the DOJ, Florida <a href="http://www.dos.state.fl.us/oss/secretary-bio.aspx">Secretary of State Kurt Browning</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.dos.state.fl.us/news/communications/pressRelease/pdf/State_of_Florida_Amended_Complaint_No_11-cv-01428-CKK-MG-ESH.pdf">requested</a> [complaint, PDF] that the federal court either declare those provisions entitled to preclearance under Section 5, or declare the preclearance obligation of Section 5 itself unconstitutional, along with its coverage formula prescribed in Section 4(b) of the VRA, and to issue a permanent injunction enjoining their enforcement. Currently five counties in Florida are covered by Section 5. The VRA was enacted to put an end to the systematic disenfranchisement of minority voters that ran rampant in Southern districts in the 1960s. According to a public <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php">DOJ list</a> [materials], currently nine whole states and many individual counties and municipalities are Section 5 Covered Jurisdictions. The US Senate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/washington/21vote.html">extended the VRA</a> [NYT report] in 2006 by an overwhelming 98-0 vote.

<p>Last month the DC District Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-dismisses-state-challenge-to-voting-rights-law.php">dismissed a similar constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the Section 5/4(b) preclearance rules. In dismissing the suit brought by officials representing Shelby County, Alabama, and a corps of conservative activists, the court concluded that the modern existence of intentional racial discrimination in voting does in fact justify the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA requirements. The Arizona <A href = "http://www.azag.gov/">Attorney General</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-sues-federal-government-over-voting-rights-act.php">filed a similar suit</a> [JURIST report] in August seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Section 5 rules in that state. In 2009, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>] the Section 5 provisions of the VRA in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-322">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court voted 8-1 in favor of permitting the appellant municipality to "bail out" from the preclearance requirement if it can establish a history of compliance with the VRA, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of the 25-year extension of the act. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined that "things have changed in the South," observing that "[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare." The plaintiff was a municipal utility district in Texas that wanted to be exempted from the requirement and was challenging the most recent extension generally. At their enactment in 1965, the requirements were only supposed to be in place for five years. Section 5 has since been extended several times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdulmutallab, 24, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/12/us-usa-crime-bombing-idUSTRE79B2U320111012">admitted to eight felonies</a> [Reuters report], including conspiracy to commit terrorism, attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. In January 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">not-guilty pleas</a> [JURIST report] were entered on behalf of Abdulmutallab, who was representing himself in the trial with help from an attorney. As the prosecution this week was preparing to present a mountain of physical evidence against him, Abdulmutallab, who is linked to al Qaeda, suddenly and against the advice of the assisting attorney <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/12/underwear-bomber-abdulmutallab-pleads-guilty">changed his pleas</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in a five-minute statement before the court in which he claimed he was participating in an act of jihad against the US by trying to bring down the civilian airliner, which held almost 300 people. Abdulmutallab intended to blow the plane out of the sky over US soil, but the bomb concealed in his underwear failed to go off. Instead, he suffered severe burns and was subdued by fellow passengers and airline crew. Before accepting his guilty pleas, US District Judge Nancy Edmunds required Abdulmutallab to make a statement acknowledging the factual basis of the charges against him. He will be sentenced on January 12 and faces life in prison.

<p>The trial began only Monday, with jury selection having <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/jury-selection-begins-for-accused-plane-bomber.php">taken place</a> [JURIST report] last week. In September, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-rules-accused-plane-bombers-hospital-statements-admissible.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that statements made by Abdulmutallab while in the hospital following his bombing attempt were admissible. In December 2010, a federal grand jury charged Abdulmutallab with <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/accused-plane-bomber-facing-additional-federal-charges.php">two new counts of conspiracy and firearm possession</a>, in addition to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">six previous charges</a> [JURIST reports] of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. Three months earlier, in September, Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/accused-plane-bomber-fires-lawyers-inquires-about-possible-guilty-plea.php">fired his lawyers and chose to represent himself</a> [JURIST report]. The use of <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm">full body scanners</a> [TSA backgrounder] at airports is largely a response to Abdulmutallab's failed bombing attempt. In July the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-challenge-to-tsa-body-scans.php">rejected a constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the use of the controversial full body scanners by holding that the use of the scanners does not constitute an unreasonable search.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The filing was in response to a motion filed last week by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], which requested that the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">halt enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the state's <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 56 text] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants, arguing that the state law is preempted by federal immigration law. Strange argued that the law is necessary to address the problem of illegal immigrants "taking jobs away from United States citizens and authorized aliens who desperately want to work in these hard economic times." Strange also argued that an injunction of the law would confuse the public and cause long-lasting harm, while allowing officials to enforce the law as the case proceeds would promote consistency. The law requires school officials to verify the immigration status of children and parents, authorizes police to detain an individual and ask for papers if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" that the driver is in the country illegally, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents.

<p>The <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] denied two similar motions for injunction <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">last week</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">last month</a> [JURIST reports]. Alabama state officials have <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">defended the law</a> [JURIST report] and argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law. The state officials point out that the law contains mechanisms safeguarding against unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and allegations suggesting provisions of the law would deter students from enrolling in school are speculative. The DOJ, joined by several rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-immigration-law.php">appeared before the court in August</a> [JURIST report] to make arguments against the law's enactment, at which point Chief Justice Sharon Lovelace Blackburn issued the temporary injunction to forestall enactment of the challenged provisions while she evaluated their contention with federal statute. From when the legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law in June</a>, 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST reports] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-945.pdf">Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-guantanamo-detainee-cases.php">report</a>], the court considered whether a suspect's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights were violated when he was strip searched twice after being arrested for a non-criminal offense and the circumstances did not suggest that he was carrying contraband. Petitioner Albert Florence was arrested in New Jersey after being pulled over when it was discovered that there was an outstanding warrant against him for failure to pay a fine, which is considered a non-criminal offense in New Jersey. He produced a letter stating that he had paid the fine, but the officer made the arrest anyway. Florence was transported to a local jail where he was forced to strip naked for inspection. He was transferred to another correctional facility a week later and was again subjected to a strip search. Florence later filed suit under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00001983----000-.html">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text], alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The US District Court for the District of New Jersey granted summary judgment for the defendants, but the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/093603p.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF]. Counsel for Florence argued that the search was illegal because it was not based on reasonable suspicion, but was based on a jail policy that subjected every arrestee to a strip search. Counsel stated that the case was distinct from the situation in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1978/1978_77_1829">Bell v. Wolfish</a> [materials], where the court ruled that the possible innocence of arrestees should not prevent officials from performing searches in order to maintain their facility. Counsel made a distinction between major versus minor offenders, arguing that strip searches are more warranted for offenders who are "inclined to violence," and called any argument finding suspicion that Florence was smuggling contraband "laugh out loud funny." Counsel requested that the jail's blanketed policy be replaced by a case-by-case review. Counsel for the facilities argued that there was no reasonable suspicion requirement in the case because the search was more cursory and not invasive, like a cavity search. Counsel further argued that the classification of the offense should not matter because minor offenders could just as easily as major offenders smuggle contraband into the prison population. Counsel asked that the court give deference to the judgment of prison officials as to what is appropriate.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-694.pdf">Judulang v. Holder</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-guantanamo-detainee-case.php">report</a>], the court considered whether a lawful permanent resident who was convicted by guilty plea of an offense that renders him deportable, but did not leave and reenter the US in the time between his conviction and commencement of removal proceedings, may seek a discretionary waiver of the conviction and thereby avoid removal under former section 212(c) of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text]. Judulang, the son of immigrants from the Philippines, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1989 and later claimed that he could seek a discretionary waiver of deportation under 212(c). The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/memdispo.nsf/pdfview/091707/$File/06-70986.PDF">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Judulang's aggravated felony crime of violence was not a ground for exclusion under the statute. Counsel for Judulang argued that he would have been eligible to apply for such a waiver under section 212(c) prior to the BIA's 2005 decision in <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol23/3509.pdf">Matter of Blake</a> [opinion, PDF], which changed the policy and found no statutory counterpart to 212(c) in the current immigration Act. Counsel argued that the change in policy violated equal protection as well as "considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations." Counsel for the government argued that the BIA was consistent in its decision making in this area of the law, citing earlier decisions that were consistent with <span class="casename">Blake</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The creation of an Islamic state, three months after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">official split between Sudan and South Sudan</a> [JURIST report], is intended to more accurately reflect the religious affiliation of its population, which is <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/10/13/bashir-says-sudan-will-adopt-entirely-islamic-constitution/">98 percent Muslim</a> [Reuters reports] now that the mainly Christian South Sudan is <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sudan-president-accepts-southern-sudans-vote-for-independance.php">recognized as an independent country</a> [JURIST report]. This leaves the future of the more than one million South Sudanese living in Sudan, who have already been given until the spring to leave and are treated as foreigners, even more in doubt.

<p>Al-Bashir remains an extremely controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

Brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and other civil rights groups, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/complaint_final.pdf">class action suit</a> [complaint, PDF] claims the new legislation is unconstitutional, inviting racial profiling and interfering with federal law. The immigration law allows police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest, and mandates businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the citizenship status of employees and job applicants. Penalties for knowingly employing illegal immigrants include suspension and revocation of a state business license. Victoria Middleton, executive director of the <a href="http://www.aclusouthcarolina.org/">ACLU of South Carolina</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/aclu-and-civil-rights-coalition-file-lawsuit-against-south-carolinas-anti">criticized the legislation</a> [ACLU press release] as the lawsuit was filed:<blockquote>By requiring local law enforcement officials to act as immigration agents, this law invites discrimination against anyone who looks or sounds "foreign," including American citizens and legal residents. It will make criminals out of good Samaritans, harm victims of crime and abuse, hamper police in preventing and solving crimes, and create a climate of fear and prejudice in South Carolina.</blockquote>The five-count complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against SB 20 as an unlawful contravention of federal immigration law under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a>, an infringement of rights against unlawful search and seizure under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> and an unconstitutional deprivation of individual liberties under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders].

<p>The <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] denied similar motions for injunction against that state's recently passed immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">last week</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">last month</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, the state of Arizona filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], on which the South Carolina and Alabama legislation is modeled. Several other state legislatures have also acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/house/house.html">North Carolina House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-passes-bill-requiring-use-of-everify.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in June to pass a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H36v7.pdf">bill</a> [HB 36 text, PDF] requiring all employers with 25 or more employees to check the immigration status of their hires using the E-Verify system. In April, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 64-32 to approve a <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/ES/ES0590.2.html">bill</a> [Amended SB 590 text] considered to be a "watered-down" version of the Arizona bill. <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports] have all approved Arizona-style immigration bills within the past year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] announced on Tuesday that it had <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/October/11-ag-1339.html">foiled the plot</a> [press release]. One man, Manssor Arbabsiar, who was working as a used-car salesman in Texas, was arrested and another, Gholam Shakuri, has been charged but is believed to be in Iran. Both men are Iranian nationals. The plot allegedly involved an attempt by the Iranians to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7GD_6_JpKE">hire a Mexican drug cartel</a> [AP report, video] to assassinate the Saudi ambassador using plastic explosives. The Convention makes it illegal to kill or threaten to kill diplomatic ambassadors and requires nations to either prosecute the offenders or extradite them so that charges can be brought against them. However, Iran has denied involvement in the plot and is unlikely to charge or extradite Shakuri. Because of Iran's refusal to charge Shakuri, the situation may <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/us-iran-usa-plot-treaty-idUSTRE79C0SE20111013?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&rpc=71">escalate to international courts</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have <a href="http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/11/iran-and-saudi-arabias-hate-hate-relationship/">existed for decades</a> [CNN backgrounder]. There is both a political and religious divide between the countries, as Saudi Arabia is predominately Sunni and Iran is predominately Shia. The recent Arab Spring has only <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/21/iran-vs-saudi-arabia/">exacerbated tensions between the countries</a> [CNN Q&#38;A] as Iran, at least initially, supported the revolutions because it saw Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain as American allies. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, wished to preserve the status quo in the Arab world. Many commentators suggest that the alleged assassination plot will only <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2096764,00.html">further escalate the tension between the countries</a> [TIME report] and strengthen the weakening US-Saudi relationship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House and Senate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/13/us-free-trade-agreements-korea">voted in rapid succession</a> [AP report] to pass the trade pacts with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, which are predicted by the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> [official website] to boost national exports by approximately $13 billion, about 0.1 percent of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp">GDP</a> [BEA materials]. The agreements will lower or eliminate tariffs that US exporters face in the three countries and take steps to better protect intellectual property and improve access for American investors there. The agreement with South Korea, the world's <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html">thirteenth largest economy</a> [CIA World Factbook backgrounder] in 2010 with an estimated GDP of $1.459 trillion, is being hailed as the largest such deal since the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) [USTR backgrounder] with Mexico and Canada in 1994, which created the world's largest free trade zone. The agreements passed by large margins in both chambers of Congress, despite opposition from labor groups and other critics of free trade agreements who say they result in job losses and ignore labor rights problems in the partner countries. In the House, the votes were 278-151 for South Korea, 300-129 for Panama and 262-167 for Colombia; the Senate votes were 83-15 for Korea, 77-22 for Panama and 66-33 for Colombia. The last free trade agreement completed by the US was with Peru in 2007.

<p>Despite the large margins and bipartisan support, the measures did not pass without debate. Republicans criticized <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] for taking several years to send the agreements to Congress for approval, as they were each originally signed during the Bush administration. Many in the president's own party, including organized labor and Democrats from areas hit hard by foreign competition, were critical of the White House for espousing the benefits of free trade, especially with Colombia, which has a reputation for violence against labor leaders and a history of labor leader assassinations. To appease Democrats, the White House demanded that the trade bills be linked to an extension of a Kennedy-era program that helps workers displaced by foreign competition, an extension that passed through Congress successfully with the trade agreements. In a press release the <a href="http://www.panamcham.com/">Panama Chamber of Commerce</a> [official website] stated it "believes that implementation of the U.S.-Panama agreement will enhance export and investment opportunities for US companies and will enable American workers to compete in the quickly growing global economy, in which Panama plays a pivotal role as the gateway to the Americas." The first official trade pact between the US and Central America was <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/president-bush-signs-central-american.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by then-president George W. Bush in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill dissolves current registrations and establishes a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kazakhstan-passes-restrictive-religion-law-expected-to-shut-out-minority-groups/2011/09/29/gIQAnX2R6K_story.html">procedure requiring groups to meet membership thresholds</a> [AP report]&#8212;at least 50 members to register locally, 500 members to register regionally and 5,000 members to register nationally&#8212;in order to be able to re-register in the predominantly Muslim country. The law also <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kazakhstan/8796464/New-laws-in-Kazakhstan-to-restrict-religious-groups.html">limits where a person may worship</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] and bans prayer rooms from government buildings altogether. Norweigian religious advocacy group <a href="http://www.forum18.org/index.php">Forum 18</a> [advocacy website] criticized the new law for <a href="http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1624">unnecessarily limiting freedom of religion</a> [statement]. Recently, Kazakhstani lawmakers have been <a href="http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/09/29/kazakhstan-parliament-passes-tough-religious-legislation-2/">unsettled by religious extremists</a> [VOA report] plotting acts of terrorism across Central Asia's largest economy and hope the new law will help lessen religious militancy. Nazarbayev, who proposed the new measures, signed the law nearly two weeks after the upper house of the <a href="http://www.parlam.kz/en">Kazakhstani parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/kazakhstan-parliament-approves-restrictive-legislation-in-an-effort-to-curb-religious-extremism.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Human rights groups have closely scrutinized Kazakhstan's adherence to its international human rights obligations. In April, Nazarbayev <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kazakhstan-president-fires-six-supreme-court-justices-for-corruption.php">discharged six justices</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.supcourt.kz/en/">Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan</a> [official website] for corruption. Kazakhstan submitted to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official websites] in February 2010. Kazakhstan <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/KZsession7.aspx">accepted 121 of the recommendations</a> [Kazakhstan UPR materials] to reduce human rights violation, particularly with respect to freedom of the press. In August 2009, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/kazahkstan-high-court-upholds-state.php">affirmed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of publisher Ramazan Esergepov, who was sentenced to three years in jail for revealing state secrets in his newspaper. A representative of <a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/">Freedom of the Media</a> at the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official websites] said that <a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/51228">revealing public corruption</a> [press release] is "the main duty of the journalists acting in the public interest," and that "[c]riminal sanctions for 'breach of secrecy' should only apply to the officials whose job descriptions stipulate the duty to protect sensitive information, but not to citizens."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Interviews of 300 Libyan prisoners in August and September revealed that many were abducted from their homes without arrest warrants, were beaten and tortured in prison to elicit confessions and are still being held with charges, all in violation of domestic and international law. Among other abuses, the briefing alleged that sub-Saharan blacks face heightened abuse and discrimination in the detention facilities, including lack of mattresses, verbal abuse and beatings. AI acknowledged the challenges facing the newly formed government, the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [website]:<blockquote>The NTC faces considerable challenges in its efforts to reform the judicial system and control the numerous armed militias that have largely taken the law into their own hands. In a period of transition, it is imperative that the NTC firmly demonstrate its commitment to turning the page on decades of gross and systematic violations in Libya. It must uphold human rights in Libya and exercise the necessary political will to investigate abuses committed by anti-Gaddafi forces, prosecute those responsible, and ensure that individuals found guilty of abuses are held to account for their actions and removed from positions that would allow them to repeat such abuses.</blockquote>Trials in the country <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/new-libya-%E2%80%99stained%E2%80%99-detainee-abuse-2011-10-13">have been suspended</a> [AI news release] since the NTC took control earlier this year. 

<p>The NTC has been gaining recognition among other countries, as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/world-bank-recognizes-new-libya-regime-as-it-vows-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">World Bank</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights after AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. Also last month, the NTC assured world leaders that Libya <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-interim-leaders-pledge-adherence-to-rule-of-law.php">will be a society of tolerance and respect</a> [JURIST report] for the rule of law.

The 11-year sentence was significantly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-13/rajaratnam-insider-trading-sentence-sends-wall-street-right-message-view.html">lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors</a> [Bloomberg report] and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/galleon-rajaratnam-guidelines-idUSN1E79C25920111013">less than the 19 1/2-year minimum</a> [Reuters report] indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Even so, Rajaratnam's sentence is the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-13/rajaratnam-suffered-severe-stroke-in-2007-defense-says.html">longest term ever imposed for insider trading</a> [Bloomberg report] and is part of a <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/rajaratnam-is-sentenced-to-11-years/">trend of tougher sentences for white-collar criminals</a> [NYT report] precipitated in part by the federal sentencing guidelines which Congress passed in 1987. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence.  

<p>Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted of 14 counts of insider trading</a> [JURIST report] in May in the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> in September and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">originally pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 after being indicted for insider trading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] for his role in torture, ahead of his travel to an economic summit in British Colombia next week. AI's <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/files/CanadaBushSubmission.pdf">submission</a> [text, PDF] to Canadian authorities emphasizes Bush's <a href="http://www.businessreviewcanada.ca/business_leaders/amnesty-international-urges-canada-to-prosecute-george-w-bush">authorization of "enhanced interrogation techniques"</a> [<em>Business Review Canada</em> report] including waterboarding, which Bush has admitted. Pressing obligations under international law, HRW urged:<blockquote>There is overwhelming evidence that Bush and other senior administration officials authorized and implemented a regime of torture and ill-treatment of hundreds of detainees in US custody, including at least two Canadian citizens. Under the Convention against Torture, Canada is obligated to prosecute individuals suspected of committing torture found in its territory if other countries have failed to do so. The Obama administration has failed to investigate allegations of involvement in torture by Bush or other senior administration officials, and none are expected.</blockquote>The Canadian government has <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Ottawa+dismisses+Amnesty+International+stunt/5543152/story.html">rejected</a> [Reuters report] AI's call to arrest the former head of state calling it a cheap stunt.  

<p>Calls for the investigation or arrest of former president Bush have largely been rejected. In February, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.eu/">European Center for Human Rights</a> (ECCHR) [advocacy websites] urged the signatory states of the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges against the former president</a> [JURIST report]. The call came as the rights groups announced that <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/FINAL%207%20Feb%20BUSH%20INDICTMENT.pdf">two criminal complaints</a> [text, PDF] were to be filed in Switzerland against Bush before he canceled his trip to the country. Calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">consistently rejected by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] urged US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Bush for violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340---A000-.html">federal statute prohibiting torture</a> [18 USC &#167; 2340A]. Also citing his memoir, the ACLU argued that the use of waterboarding has historically been prosecuted as a crime in the US. The letter also argued that failure to investigate Bush would harm the US's ability to advocate for human rights in other countries. Bush's secretary of defense <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Donald+Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] has also faced possible criminal charges in Europe, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Bashir is expected to attend a trade summit in Malawi this weekend, despite two international warrants out for his arrest on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Malawi has refused calls from western powers to arrest al-Bashir, as President Bingu wa Mutharika indicated his belief that leaders should only be tried domestically and not by the ICC. However, Mutharika's failure to arrest al-Bashir would constitute a violation of Malawi's obligations under the Rome Statute. Despite an arrest warrant issued in March 2009 and another one in July 2010, al-Bashir continues to avoid trial by the ICC. 

<p>Al-Bashir announced on Wednesday that Sudan will <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sudan-to-adopt-islamic-constitution.php">adopt an Islamic constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Bashir remains an extremely controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the Darfur conflict. In June, AI urged Malaysia to withdraw an invitation for al-Bashir to participate in an event there and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">arrest him if he travels to the country</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June, ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo issued a statement claiming that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur. In May, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">ICC urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] while he visited that year for a second time.

Ban Ki-moon also acknowledged the dialogue between the government and pro-democratic leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>], as well as talks between the authorities and ethnic groups in an effort to bring stability and address the challenges currently facing the country. Some of the prisoners released have been addressed by the Special Rapporteur in the past. The <a href="http://www.aappb.org/">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma)</a> (AAPPB) [advocacy website] on Thursday claimed that Myanmar's announcement is merely an attempt to <a href="http://www.aappb.org/release193.html">appease the international community</a> [press release]. Despite an announcement on October 11 that Myanmar would release 6,359 prisoners, no further information about the actual number of prisoners that will be released has been publicized. According to the AAPPB, the timing of the Myanmar government's announcement coincides with other concerns, signifying that the release of prisoners is just an attempt by the government to ease international tension. AAPPB said that the prisoner release is not satisfactory 

<p>On Tuesday, US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that Myanmar's civilian-led government was planning dramatic changes including <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-to-free-hundreds-of-political-prisoners.php">releasing hundreds of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and consequential dialogue with Suu Kyi. Myanmar has sought to improve its international reputation following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. Last month, Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">formed the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission</a> (MNHRC) [JURIST report] to promote and safeguard the country's constitutional rights. In August, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">urged the government of Myanmar to investigate human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and improve its rights record. In May, Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-releasing-nearly-15000-prisoners-after-un-visit.php">began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The reform targets articles 4 and 27 of the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/mex/en_mex-int-text-const.pdf">Mexican constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Article 4 guarantees that "[n]o one may be deprived of the fruits of his labor except by judicial decision." Article 27 provides the government the "right to regulate the utilization of natural resources" distribute resources equitably for the public good. Schutter observed that Mexico's progress towards realizing the right to food has been <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11173&LangID=E">"uneven"</a> [report]. Although the percent of children who are considered underweight in Mexico decreased from 14.2 percent in 1998 to 5 percent in 2006, the overall number of people living in "food poverty" increased 4.4 percent from 2006 to 2008.

<p>Schutter urged governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-expert-urges-legal-reforms-to-fight-global-hunger-crisis.php">reform their legal systems</a> [JURIST report] to fight hunger and promote the right to food in May 2010. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] has historically called for an increased effort to uphold the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/un-sg-urges-renewed-focus-on.php">"fundamental human right" to food</a> [JURIST report] for people around the world who suffer from chronic hunger. The right to adequate food is recognized in Articles 24(2)(c) and 27(3) of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, Article 12(2) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a>, and Articles 25(f) and 28(1) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [texts]. Article 25 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a> [text], adopted by the UN in 1948, states that "[e]veryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling came in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">motion filed last week</a> [JURIST report] by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and a coalition of immigrants rights groups after a judge for the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official websites] twice <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] from taking effect. The appeals court granted the DOJ's motion to block Section 28, which requires immigration status checks of public school students, and Section 10, which makes it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. The appeals court refused to block provisions that require police to check the immigration status of suspected illegal aliens, bar state courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants and make it a felony for illegal immigrants to enter into a "business transaction," including applying for a driver's license. The injunction will remain in effect until the Eleventh Circuit hears oral arguments and issues a ruling on the constitutional questions presented by the case.

<p>The state of Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/alabama-defends-immigration-law-in-federal-appeals-court.php">responded</a> [JURIST report] to the DOJ's motion earlier this week, arguing that the law is not preempted by federal law and that it is necessary to address the problem of illegal immigrants "taking jobs away from United States citizens and authorized aliens who desperately want to work in these hard economic times." The DOJ, joined by several rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-immigration-law.php">appeared before the district court</a> in August to make arguments against the law's enactment, at which point Chief Justice Sharon Lovelace Blackburn <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST reports] to forestall enactment of the challenged provisions. From the time that the legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> in June, 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST reports] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay stated that the Syrian government has failed to protect its population and has ignored calls from the international community to cooperate with international investigations into possible human rights violations. According to a report adopted Tuesday by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHCR) [official website], Syria has <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/syria-rejects-calls-to-join-icc.php">rejected calls from several nations</a> [JURIST report] to join the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Pillay cited repeated reports of snipers firing from rooftops and the use of live ammunition in the shelling of residential neighborhoods as examples of the excessive force being used against peaceful protesters. According to Pillay: <blockquote>The result has been a devastatingly remorseless toll of human lives. The number of people killed since the violence started in March has now exceeded 3,000, including at least 187 children. More than 100 people have been reported killed in the last 10 days alone. In addition, thousands have been arrested, detained, forcibly disappeared and tortured. Family members inside and outside the country have been targeted for harassment, intimidation, threats and beatings. As more members of the military refuse to attack civilians and change sides, the crisis is already showing worrying signs of descending into an armed struggle.</blockquote>Pillay also indicated that protesters' family members, both inside and outside Syria, are being threatened, harassed and intimidated. She expressed concern that the struggle against the protesters could dissolve into an armed struggle. Pillay called on the international community to speak with one voice in order to protect the Syrian people and prevent the country from falling into civil-war. 

<p>Last month, the UNHRC voted 33-4 to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-council-adopts-syria-probe-resolution.php">adopt a resolution</a> [JURIST report] ordering an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39357&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">investigation</a> [press release] into crimes against humanity in Syria and urging the Syrian government once again to halt its violent crackdown against peaceful protesters. An emergency meeting was held in <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">response to a plea</a> [JURIST report] from Pillay to refer Syria to the ICC for an investigation into the violent suppression of anti-government protests. Many steps have been taken to try and halt the violence in Syria. In August, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. In July, two UN rights officials expressed <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. In June, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) published a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year. In April, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">urged Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors allege that Tymoshenko embezzled USD $400 million of debt from her company United Energy Systems of Ukraine onto the state. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has called the prosecution of Tymoshenko politically motivated and based on <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/jailed-former-ukraine-prime-minister-must-be-released-2011-10-11">charges that are not internationally recognizable offenses</a> [press release]. The US and several European countries have echoed AI's statements and have called the prosecution the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15263475">criminalization of normal political decision-making</a> [BBC report]. Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/n27socn2">repeated her hope</a> [press release] that the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] would overturn Tuesday's guilty verdict and stated her <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/vn34xesv">intention to appeal</a> [press release]. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article%3Fart_id=72980&cat_id=32589">Ukrainian parliament</a> [official website] rejected four amendments to the country's <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes">Criminal Code</a> [materials] that sought to decriminalize Article 365, which <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-rejects-criminal-code-amendments-tymoshenko-still-faces-prison.php">stipulates jail time for abuse of office</a> [JURIST report]. Tymoshenko's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-prosecutors-seek-7-year-sentence-for-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">resumed</a> at the end of September after a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-trial-delayed.php">two-week recess</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, former Ukrainian president <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm">Viktor Yushchenko</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-president-testifies-against-former-ally-tymoshenko.php">testified against</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko, his former prime minister. That same month, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Members of Chen's family, including his wife, were also <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20111014-304961.html">found guilty on corruption charges</a> [ANN report] and given prison sentences ranging from six months to 11 years. A lower court originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-ex-president-chen-acquitted-in-bank-merger-fraud-case.php">acquitted Chen</a> [JURIST report] and 21 other defendants of the charges last November, citing lack of evidence supporting the allegations, and specifically noting that under the country's Anti-Corruption Act, the president <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/06/2003487820/1">does not control bank mergers</a> [<em>Taipei Times</em> report] and as such he could not take bribes to influence them. Chen and his wife were accused of taking <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">$20 million in bribes from banks and financial institutions</a> [JURIST report] that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program. A spokesperson for the court noted that Chen's total prison time <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/world/asia/taiwan-ex-president-chen-shui-bian-gets-18-years.html">cannot exceed 30 years</a> [NYT report]. The defendants, including Chen, are <a href="http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1735556">able to appeal</a> [<em>Taiwan News</em> report] the court's ruling.

<p>Chen was found guilty on corruption charges and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> in September 2009, but the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/taiwan-ex-president-chens-life-sentence-reduced-to-20-years.php">sentence was reduced to 20 years</a> [JURIST reports] in June 2010 after the high court determined he had not embezzled as much money as previously thought. Chen was also <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 on additional corruption charges relating to funds he received while traveling abroad as president. Chen was initially detained in November 2008, and was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">formally indicted</a> [JURIST report] a month later. In January 2009, he <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention, after staging three hunger strikes in protest. Chen maintains that current Taiwanese <a href="http://www.president.gov.tw/">President Ma Ying-jeou</a> [official website, in Chinese] is using Chen's trial to distance himself from Chen's anti-China views. Chen served as president of Taiwan from 2000-2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thousands were allegedly killed and hundreds detained and raped in the months-long struggle between ousted leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> and rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profiles] after Gbagbo refused to give up power. The ICC announced earlier this month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-to-open-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">initiate a formal investigation</a> [JURIST report], and Ocampo has been asked to report any information collected pertaining to the allegations between the years 2002-2010. Before his trip, Ocampo <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/D6787F71-EC65-4DB9-9320-16ED7FBE3C1F.htm">said</a> [statement]:<blockquote>I am grateful to President Ouattara for extending the invitation for me to conduct an official visit to Cote d'Ivoire. We will also meet members of the Opposition. We will meet with victims, and listen to their views and concerns. We believe it is critically important to meet with the Truth, Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission, which has a crucial mandate to contribute to the prevention of new crimes, the establishment of individual responsibilities and the reconciliation of all Ivorians.</blockquote>The Ivory Coast probe marks Ocampo's seventh inquiry into African conflicts and the first investigation into a state not party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [official website] of the ICC.

<p>Ocampo officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-requests-permission-to-investigate-ivory-coast.php">requested permission</a> [JURIST report] from ICC judges in June to begin the investigation into the Ivory Coast after determining that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed. The Ivory Coast announced earlier in that month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. An official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo in June. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">deaths of at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of inter-communal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552] request for documents disclosing Kagan's involvement in PPACA was <a href = "http://www.cnsnews.com/sites/default/files/documents/FOIA%20DOCUMENTS-DOJ.pdf">already fulfilled</a> [text, PDF] to a division of the MRC, <a href = "http://www.cnsnews.com/">CNSNews</a> [official website] in May 2010. Various agency documents detailing Kagan's involvement in health care reform were released, which amounted to 45 out of a potential 1,400 pages matching the initial request. This included then-solicitor general Kagan assigning a deputy, Neal Katyal, to defend PPACA in court. Judicial Watch and MRC then requested further records and correspondence, which the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] did not provide due to exemptions and declaring many of the requested documents as non-agency records. Judge Huvelle agreed, rejecting the groups' requests on several grounds, finding the DOJ's first search adequate, and declaring that the e-mails the groups sought were, "not relied upon by the [Office of Solicitor General] in carrying out its business, but rather was used for a purely personal objective." Huvelle also upheld the attorney work-product privilege of FOIA to allow the government to withhold documents that "discussed legal defense of the forthcoming health care legislation in response to an anticipated court challenge." A spokesperson for Judicial Watch said he is <a href = "http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2011/10/judge-finds-in-favor-of-doj-in-suit-regarding-kagans-role-in-health-care-litigation.html">unsure if they will pursue further litigation</a> [BLT report] but said the judgment called into question parts of Kagan's senate testimony.

<p>It is becoming increasingly likely that the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] will review the health care law this term. <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [official website] last week <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the court to review its case against PPACA, making it the sixth <em>writ of certiorari</em> on the issue. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-appeal-to-supreme-court-on-health-care-law.php">asked the high court to rule last month</a> [JURIST report], appealing an August ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down the individual mandate</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional, creating a circuit split. Virginia <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/">Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli</a> [official website] has also <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/virginia-appeals-health-care-dismissal-to-supreme-court.php">asked the Supreme Court to weigh in</a> [JURIST report] on PPACA, appealing a Fourth Circuit ruling. The US <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law in June</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">that ruling was appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> [advocacy website]. Also in August, the US <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by a physician organization for lack of standing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Carmen Cardona filed for veterans' spousal benefits last year but was denied. The <a href = "http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> [official website] reportedly told her she could not receive benefits because her spouse was a woman, which is not a recognized marriage under federal law. The Department has <a href = "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/13/disabled-navy-veteran-in-same-sex-marriage-to-sue-for-denied-benefits/">declined to comment</a> [Fox News report] on the potential litigation. Although in February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision, there is no obligation on federal agencies not to enforce the law.

<p>US <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] told gay rights activists in October that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA, reinforcing that the DOJ is not defending its constitutionality. However, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he was launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA in March, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution." In February, congressional Democrats introduced the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report], but it has not yet passed. A July 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Currently DOMA allows other states to ignore those recognized same-sex marriages, and prevents same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits available to married couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the filing, the three Republican members of the group, including House Speaker <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website], responded to a motion for summary judgment by plaintiff Karen Golinski, whose request to extend her health insurance benefits to her wife was denied. Golinski <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-16/boehner-led-group-defends-marriage-law-in-worker-benefits-suit.html">seeks a declaration that DOMA is unconstitutional</a> [Bloomberg report]. The group contends that Golinski's claim fails because DOMA "easily passes the rational basis test," which would apply because "sexual orientation is not a suspect or quasi-suspect class under the traditional factors used to determine such classes" including immutability and political powerlessness:<blockquote>Given that the Ninth Circuit has just finished wrestling with the consequences of the repeal of "Don't Ask Don't Tell," Plaintiff should not be heard to contend that such issues cannot be rectified through the legislative process. Moreover, Plaintiff appears oblivious to the irony of maintaining that homosexuals have limited political power in a case in which her position is supported by the Department of Justice at the insistence of the President. In light of the Department's longstanding duty to defend the constitutionality of federal statutes, its decision to decline to defend the constitutionality of DOMA&#8212;notwithstanding its acknowledgment that reasonable arguments can be advanced in defense of Section 3, that it survives rational basis review, and that eleven Circuit Courts of Appeal, including the Ninth, disagree with its conclusion that heightened scrutiny applies&#8212;and instead adopt the very position advocated by Plaintiff, is particularly telling.</blockquote>Earlier this month, at the fifteenth annual dinner hosted by equal rights group <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] told gay rights activists that he would continue to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] DOMA.

<p>Even though the Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">stopped defending the constitutionality of DOMA</a> [JURIST report], benefits continue to be denied. Just this week, a disabled Navy veteran <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] for denying her partner a share of her disability benefits under DOMA.

The new article <a href="http://213.158.162.45/~egyptian/index.php?action=news&id=21689&title=New%20article%20toughens%20penalties%20against%20prejudice%20in%20Egypt">imposes heavy penalties</a> [<em>Egyptian Gazette</em> article], amounting to fines of up to EGP 100,000 (USD $16,778) and a prison sentence of up to three months, on civil servants who discriminate against citizens either as individuals or as a sect in ways that threaten social justice or equal opportunity or disturb the public peace. Ordinary citizens who commit the same crimes will be fined up to EGP 50,000 (USD $5,033) and sentenced to up to three months in jail. The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7LF0JD20111015">introduction of the article</a> [Reuters report] comes in response to public calls for tougher legal measures against all forms of discrimination, and the measure follows last Sunday's clashes between troops and protesters, many of whom were Coptic Christians. Twenty-five people were killed in the fighting, representing the worst street violence since the fall of former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jezeera profile] in February 11. Many have accused the ruling military of using tactics reminiscent of Mubarak's police force against the protesters in last week's violence.

<p>Earlier this month a similar SCAF amendment altered election rules to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">ban the use of religious slogans</a> [JURIST report] in campaigning. The article came ahead of the upcoming November elections and is expected to have an immediate effect on the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=26508">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] whose traditional slogan "Islam is the solution" was banned under the new electoral guidelines. However, two days later an <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">Egyptian court overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report] that prohibited presidential hopeful <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4558054.stm">Ayman Nour</a> [BBC profile] from forming the Islamic-based political party <a href="http://www.egyig.com/">Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya</a> [party website]. In March, Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-to-lift-state-of-emergency-before-september-election.php">lift the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] before parliamentary polls were to be held. The election announcement came a week after an overwhelming majority of Egyptians voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-citizens-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-constitutional-reform.php">approve several constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] in a national referendum.

In an interview-format article published over the weekend, EC <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/index_en.htm">President Jose Manuel Barroso</a> [official website] stated that during the coming week he will propose to introduce into European law for the first time the recognition of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYrighRJGCrPUansfYXh8D4juFOA?docId=CNG.a5e3acd386024a6e8b68df246753a8c6.1b1">individual criminal liability</a> [AFP report] for financial players who break European regulations. An English translation of his statement reads:<blockquote>I will propose Thursday that individual criminal responsibility of financial actors is finally recognized in European law. ... We have seen abusive behavior in the markets. Some have caused the current crisis. We will regulate these practices! Those who violate will incur penalties. It will be a first in European legislation and a strong signal.</blockquote> Barroso's proposals would oblige EU nations to amend their statutory framework to include criminal penalties for financial regulation violations.

<p>The European <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">debt crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] has led to calls for tougher regulation of financial sectors, especially in the less transparent markets for collateralized debt obligations and other exotic securities that sparked the worldwide financial crisis. Less solvent nations such as Greece and Spain have been forced to pass austerity measures and seek funds from more stable EU neighbors like Germany. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.aup.edu/faculty/dept/icp/eaker.htm">Larry Eaker</a> of the American University of Paris recently <a href="/forum/2011/09/larry-eaker-eurozone-exit.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the debt crisis in the EU has made it necessary to examine whether it is legally possible for a eurozone nation to leave the EU and abandon the joint currency altogether. Last month a German high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/germany-high-court-rejects-challenges-to-european-stimulus.php">rejected challenges</a> [JURIST report] brought against the constitutionality of EU rescue package and financial aid package given to Greece. In August Spain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/spain-parties-agree-to-amend-constitution-to-set-limits-on-national-deficit.php">amend its constitution</a> [JURIST report] to limit its national deficit. Italy and Spain have succeeded in lowering borrowing costs by <a href="http://www.chron.com/business/article/Italian-borrowing-costs-slide-2142237.php">taking advantage of a European bond-buying</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report] program, and Sweden has resolved to <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/35582/20110816/">protect its banking and financial institutions</a> [<em>The Local</em> report] from effects of the debt crisis by increasing funds for more financial inspections and deposit guarantees. In June, Greece, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/greece-pm-proposes-constitutional-referendum.php">proposed a constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report] aimed at eliminating the systemic governmental inefficiency and waste that led to the crisis that has wracked the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor plans to call four witnesses to refute testimony of one of the defense experts, an orthopedic surgeon, who <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1159929/1/.html">testified</a> [AP report] that Anwar's back condition would prevent him from engaging in the sexual act. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. This is the second sodomy case launched against Anwar, who has consistently argued that the allegations are a politically motivated attempt to silence the opposition. The continuance of the trial could potentially strengthen Prime Minister Najib Razak's majority government. A general election is expected to be called this year even though one is not due until 2013, causing opposition support to fear that a guilty verdict might interfere with the national polls.  

<p>A Malaysian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malaysia-high-court-finds-sodomy-case-against-opposition-leader-anwar-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that prosecutors had enough evidence to pursue a sodomy case against Anwar.  The opposite leader was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">accuser</a> [JURIST reports] in late June. Last December, Anwar filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. The leaked US diplomatic cable claimed <a href="http://www.ona.gov.au/">Australia's Office of National Assessments</a> [official website] had concluded, in agreement with Singapore's Intelligence Agency, that the sodomy charges against Anwar were the result of a set-up, but that he was in fact guilty of committing the acts. Last year, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected Anwar's 2006 defamation suit</a> [JURIST report] against against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] for allegedly suggesting at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. Anwar was Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resulting <a href="http://www.doi.gov/documents/ClassActionSettlementCobellvSalazar.pdf">$3.4 billion settlement</a> [agreement, PDF] for mismanaged Indian land royalties was the largest settlement in US government history. Cobell, who was an accountant and a member of the <a href="http://www.blackfeetnation.com/">Blackfeet tribe</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/elouise-cobell-american-indian-who-championed-class-action-lawsuit-against-us-government-dies-at-65/2011/09/02/gIQAVQwBrL_story.html">grew up on a Montana reservation</a> [WP article] without amenities such as electricity, telephone or running water.  From a young age, she was told stories about the US government shortchanging Native Americans on land development leases for oil, gas and farming, rendering her tribe largely impoverished and under-employed. As the treasurer for the Montana tribe, Cobell finally decided to bring the lawsuit in 1996 as a result of the government's slow-moving disbursements for the acreage they developed. In a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Statement-from-Secretary-Salazar-on-the-Passing-of-Elouise-Cobell.cfm">statement</a> [text] regarding her passing, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said:<blockquote>I am deeply saddened by the loss of Elouise Cobell, who dedicated her life to the betterment of Indian people. She sought justice to address historical wrongs that had weighed on our nation&#8217;s conscience and was a significant force for change. ... As we pause to reflect on Elouise's life and achievements, let us be inspired to do better by the first Americans, and to uphold our nation's promise of justice and opportunity for all.</blockquote>Cobell spent 15 years advancing the lawsuit and was diagnosed with cancer weeks before the settlement was approved.  

<p>Judge Thomas Hogan of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-approves-settlement-in-15-year-american-indian-trust-suit.php">approved the $3.4 billion settlement</a> [JURIST report] in June.

The settlement was ratified by both Houses of Congress and approved by the president before being given final approval by the district court in August. The settlement was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">agreed upon</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009.

The call to investigate comes after the <a href="http://www.icj-aust.org.au/">Australian International Commission of Jurists</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/sri-lankan-envoy-war-crimes-20111016-1lrm7.html">delivered a brief</a> [<em>The Age</em> report] to the <a href="http://www.afp.gov.au/">Australian Federal Police</a> [official website] that they claim contains credible evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The high commissioner, <a href="http://www.slhcaust.org/high-commision/he-high-commissioner.html">Thisara Samarasinghe</a> [official profile], is a former Sri Lankan navy admiral and was a commander during the last months of the war when naval ships allegedly fired on civilians. Samarasinghe claims that his actions during the war were not in violation of the rules of conflict. Calls for investigation come days before Sri Lankan <a href="http://president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] is scheduled to participate in the <a href="http://www.chogm2011.org/home">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> (CHOGM) [official website], a biannual meeting of the prime ministers and presidents of its member countries. The meeting will take place in Perth, Australia, where leaders are set to discuss both local and global issues and to develop related policies and initiatives. 

<p>Early this month, the Sri Lankan Special Envoy of the President on Human Rights, <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/directory_of_members/ViewMember.do?memID=188">Mahinda Samarasinghe</a> [official profile], announced that the Cabinet of Ministers has <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sri-lanka-unveils-5-year-action-plan-to-protect-human-rights-in-response-to-international-pressure--.php">adopted the National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights</a> [JURIST report] after coming under international criticism for allegations of human rights violations. The five-year plan addresses <a href="http://print.dailymirror.lk/news/front-page-news/58324.html">eight areas</a> [<em>Daily Mirror</em> report]: civil and political rights, economic, social, and cultural rights, children's rights, labor and migrant worker rights, and the prevention of torture. Last month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] accusing Sri Lankan troops of killing tens of thousands of civilians during the 2009 civil war. In April, a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka found <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In December, the <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">UN panel would be allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes. The decision signaled a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">reversal after months of strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government, which described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1491.htm">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-26-Kiobel-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether three oil companies are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> [text] for torture and international law violations that took place overseas. In a similar case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-88.htm">Mohamad v. Rajoub</a> [docket], the court will decide whether political organizations including the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization could be immune from liability under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.R.2092.ENR:#">Torture Victims Protection Act of 1992</a> (TVPA) [text]. The plaintiffs in both cases allege human rights violations against an entity other than an individual person. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the oil companies were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-upholds-verdict-for-shell-in-nigeria-protest-deaths.php">immune from liability</a> [JURIST report], and the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/6D348317C3C266EF85257857004E1D5D/$file/09-7109-1298886.pdf">reached the same result</a> [opinion, PDF] with respect to political organizations. The court will hear arguments for both <span class="casename">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</span> and <span class="casename">Mohamad v. Rajoub</span> in tandem.

<p>The court will also hear arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-45.htm">Elgin v. Department of the Treasury</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Elgin_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to decide whether federal district courts have jurisdiction over constitutional claims for equitable relief brought by federal employees. The plaintiffs, former federal employees who had failed to register with the Selective Service between the ages of 18 and 26 pursuant to the <a href="http://www.sss.gov/PDFs/MSSA-2003.pdf">Military Selective Service Act</a> (MSSA) [text, PDF], claim that the MSSA discriminates based on sex because it imposes a lifetime bar on federal executive agency employment for violations carried out by a specific group of men. The men resigned or were fired from their federal posts for failure to register. The US Courts of Appeals for the Third and District of Columbia Circuits have held that federal employees do have valid claims under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/complcsra.htm">Civil Service Reform Act</a> [materials], while the First, Second and Tenth Circuits have precluded such jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-210.htm">US v. Alvarez</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Alvarez-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court is asked to determine whether the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-3352">Stolen Valor Act of 2005</a> (SVA) [text], legislation that makes it a federal crime to falsely assert that one has "received a decoration or medal authorized by Congress" for US armed forces, is a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right to freedom of speech. Respondent Xavier Alvarez told members of a public water district board meeting that he was a retired US Marine, had been wounded many times and received the Congressional Medal of Honor, when in fact he had never served in the US military. Alvarez pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a fine and serve three years of probation, but the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">reversed the conviction</a> [opinion, PDF], finding the SVA facially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The US Solicitor General <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-asks-supreme-court-to-uphold-military-imposter-law.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] in his petition for <em>certiorari</em> that the appeals court erroneously applied the strict scrutiny standard to invalidate the SVA and overturn the conviction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision was applauded by the police union, <a href="http://www.alliancepn.com/">Alliance Police Nationale</a> (APN) [union website, in French], which argued that the website incited violence against police. Jean-Claude Delage, secretary general of the APN, said that "[t]he judges have analyzed the situation perfectly&#8212;this site being a threat to the integrity of the police &#8212; and made the right decision." Opponents of Internet censorship were also quick to comment on the judgment. Jeremie Zimmermann, spokesman for <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a> [advocacy website], a Paris-based net neutrality organization, called the order "an obvious will by the French government to control and censor citizens' new online public sphere." The site was ordered to be blocked immediately. 

<p>France does not have an equivalent to the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text], which prohibits the government from making any law "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." In August, the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/first-circuit-court-upholds-right-to-record-public-police-action.php">there is a clearly-established First Amendment right</a> [JURIST report] to film police officers performing their duties in a public space.

Pre-trial <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/about-the-stl/key-characters/judges-of-the-special-tribunal-for-lebanon/pre-trial-chamber-judge-daniel-fransen">Judge Daniel Fransen</a> [official profile], in accordance with STL rules, waited 30 calendar days after public announcement of the indictment before making the formal request, the prescribed next step in the process. The Shi'ite Muslim group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> [JURIST news archive] has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/lebanon-tribunal-asks-hariri-trial-absentia-152948421.html">denied any responsibility</a> [Reuters report] over the bombing, which killed Hariri and 21 other people in Beirut, and said it will not allow the suspects to be arrested.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-unseals-indictment-in-hariri-case.php">indictment was unsealed</a> in August, and the STL president has made a public plea for the four men to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">turn themselves in</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2007, the UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22746&Cr=leban&Cr1=">approved</a> [UN News Centre report] a resolution to establish an ad hoc international tribunal to investigate and try suspects in the February 2005 assassination of Hariri. The move passed in a 10-0 vote, with China, Russia, Indonesia, Qatar and South Africa abstaining. The abstaining nations objected in part to the resolution's establishment under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII of the UN Charter</a> [text], which allows for military enforcement if necessary. The controversial proposal, supported by then Lebanese prime minister Fuad Siniora but <a href="/hotline/2006/12/exclusive-lebanese-president-lahoud-on.php">opposed</a> [JURIST comment] by pro-Syrian former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Emile+Lahoud">Emile Lahoud</a> [JURIST news archive], was a source of major disagreement in Lebanon's deeply sectarian political arena.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Without more regulations, Shahinian said, some could be forced into domestic servitude and be subject to physical and psychological abuse. "I met with women who had been forced to work long hours without any remuneration or valid contract; physically and sexually abused; and morally harassed by constantly being insulted, humiliated and belittled," Shahinian said in the press release. He urged the government to ensure that the victims had access to justice.

<p>Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for a renewed international <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-secretary-general-calls-for.php">commitment to eradicate all forms of slavery</a> [JURIST report]. Ban's comments took place on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/slaveryremembranceday/index.shtml">International Day of Remembrance of Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade</a> [press release], which is held annually pursuant to General Assembly resolution <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/1438851.80354118.html">A/62/L.32</a> [text, PDF]. In his statement, Ban said that the fight against slavery continues even though the practice may now take different forms than it has in the past. Also last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hrw-urges-lebanon-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">urged Lebanon to improve its judicial system</a> [JURIST report] by providing mechanisms to better protect the basic <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/09/15/lebanon-judiciary-failing-protect-domestic-workers">rights of domestic workers</a> [press release] and more ardently prosecuting those who violate them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on Iran Ahmed Shaheed said Monday that human rights violations in Iran are on the rise, as he presented a <a href="http://news.bahai.org/sites/news.bahai.org/files/documentlibrary/859_Special_Rapporteur_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website]. Citing an increase in persecutions among political activists and journalists, Shaheed <a href="http://m.trust.org/alertnet/news/reports-of-human-rights-abuses-in-iran-on-rise--un">criticized detention conditions</a> [Reuters report], the torture and mistreatment of detainees and the significant administration of the <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/17/un_rips_irans_human_rights_record_in_new_report">death penalty to people under 18 years of age</a> [FP report]. The report also criticizes "exorbitant bail requirements" for human rights defenders and religious practitioners, as well as the detention conditions of opposition leaders and their wives. In 2011, there have been more than 200 known executions performed, while the report alleges that <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/content/198778/iran-secretly-executed-prisoners-un.html">at least 146 executions have been conducted in secret</a> [PTI report] for crimes such as drug dealing. The scathing report comes on the heels of Shaheed's August request for Iran to comply with a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-investigator-urges-iran-to-comply-with-human-rights-mandate.php">mandate to abide by International human rights obligations</a> [JURIST report].  Shaheed recognized some Iranian progress in its cooperation and implementations of recommendations for universal periodic review and observation, but reaffirmed his observations of the increasing trend of human rights violations:<blockquote>[Shaheed] stresses the urgency for greater transparency from the Iranian authorities and closer engagement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the international community in strengthening human rights safeguards for its citizens. ... [He] wishes to stress the importance of freedom of expression and assembly for a democratic, open society governed by the rule of law, and encourages the Government to refrain from repressing dissent. The Special Rapporteur would also like to underscore the importance of perpetuating a culture of tolerance, and urges the Government to prevent discrimination against women, as well religious and ethnic minorities, in all spheres of public life and services, and to protect their freedoms to freely associate and express themselves.</blockquote>The special rapporteur requested that he be able to continue to visit Iran in order to work closely with authorities in addressing human rights abuses.

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized for its alleged human rights abuses. Jailed Iranian journalist <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile] in July <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/onlymehdi/O0QzEWBcteRm34lS1J986SdAkEfGni6OX9oU3we7Z7mOkO9UaRO3RcZJfaLK/Letter.doc">urged</a> [letter, DOC, in Persian] Shaheed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/imprisoned-iran-journalist-urges-un-probe-of-prison-conditions.php">investigate prison conditions in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. In May, rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-criticize-iran-detention-of-lawyers.php">decried</a> [JURIST report] Iran's persecution of lawyers. In January, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran [official website] claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. In January, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Also in January, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report] for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petitions arguing against the release of more than 1,000 jailed Palestinians in exchange for captured Israeli soldier <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8118251.stm">Gilad Shalit</a> [BBC backgrounder] were filed by four families of the victims of the prisoners set to be released. The petitions were filed within the 48-hour window afforded to members of the public who wish to contest the prisoner exchange by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.il/mojeng">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website]. The prisoner exchange deal came after a landmark agreement between Israel and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive] that was negotiated last month. The rejection of the appeals by the court cleared the way for prisoner exchange to begin. The prisoner exchange process is set to take place in two stages and will be completed sometime next year. 

<p>The release of Shalit has been a point of contention in the already tense relations between the Israeli government and Hamas. In April, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/israel-calls-for-un-to-retract-goldstone-report.php">called for the UN to retract the Goldstone Report</a> [JURIST report], which accused Israel of war crimes, following statements made by Richard Goldstone in a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html">op-ed</a> [text] indicating that the fact finding mission underlying the report may have been flawed. The report accused Palestinian fighters of mistreating Shalit in violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68">Third Geneva Convention</a> [text]. In June 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-hamas-to-allow-access-to-israeli-soldier.php">urged Hamas</a> [JURIST report] authorities to allow Shalit to communicate with his family and receive visits from the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website]. In February 2008, a tentative agreement for the release of Shalit was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/israel-hamas-prisoner-exchange.php">hindered by disagreements</a> [JURIST report] over the identity of the Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange. Shalit was captured by Palestinian militants in 2006 during a raid on an <a href="http://www.idf.il/english">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] post near the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/files/Complaint%20-%20filed%20copy.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-groups-file-suit-challenging-north-carolina-ultrasound-law.php">report</a>], brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and other human rights groups, contests the provision requiring abortion providers to show women ultrasounds prior to performing the procedure. The measure, known as the "Women's Right to Know Act," would also require a physician to provide information to the woman regarding gestation, the risks of abortion procedures, abortion alternatives and federal medical benefits available. The plaintiffs argued during the two-and-a-half-hour hearing Monday that requiring doctors to subject women to images of the fetus and discuss the dimensions of the fetus and the presence of hands, feet and internal organs, constitute "extreme measures" that <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/NCGOL/NC/Article_2011-10-17-Abortion%20Lawsuit/id-0fd6474f36d340e2a08c8ea66ea2e7e3">transgress constitutional regulations of abortions</a> [AP report] and violate medical ethics. Special Deputy Attorney General Faison Hicks responded that the presentation of these scientific facts is lawful and promotes North Carolina's preference towards child birth within the scope of its recently enacted legislation. The judge, who inquired about a woman's ability to avoid seeing the images or hearing the information being offered by the doctor, has not yet reached a decision on the matter.

<p>The bill became law in July when the North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports] voted to override a veto by <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website]. North Carolina is one of several state legislatures to have acted recently to limit abortion rights. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] have recently passed bills requiring ultrasounds before abortions. In June, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">lawsuit challenging the Texas law</a> [JURIST report]. In March, South Dakota passed a law requiring a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">three-day waiting period</a> [JURIST report] before an abortion; the longest waiting period requirement in the country. That law is also facing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">court challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case stems from a German patent filed by <a href="http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/home2/alumni/interesting-alumni/seperate-portraits/medicine/prof-dr-oliver-bruestle.html">Oliver Brustle</a> [University of Ulm profile] who invented a method for converting human embryonic stem cells into nerve cells. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/">Greenpeace</a> [advocacy website] first challenged Brustle's patent in 1997. A German court ruled the patent invalid, and, upon appeal by Brustle, the <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">German Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website] referred questions to the ECJ. The ECJ considered "the concept of 'uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes'" within <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=31998L0044&model=guichett">Article 6(2)(c) of Directive 98/44/EC</a> [text] and held that:<blockquote>An invention must be excluded from patentability where the application of the technical process for which the patent is filed necessitates the prior destruction of human embryos or their use as base material, even if the description of that process does not contain any reference to the use of human embryos. ... The exception to the non-patentability of uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes concerns only inventions for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes which are applied to the human embryo and are useful to it.</blockquote>The ruling limits the use in Europe of stem cells for the treatment of a range of diseases, and opponents of the ruling argue it will severely undercut medical research throughout the region.

<p>Stem cell research is also a controversial topic in the US. In July, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-court-upholds-stem-cell-research.php">dismissed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] attempting to overturn April's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ban-on-federal-funding-for-stem-cell-research.php">decision</a> that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-blocks-federal-funding-for-stem-cell-research.php">ended an injunction</a> [JURIST reports] on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-reverses-stem-cell-research-ban.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] which removed the previous administration's eight-year restriction on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. After a preliminary injunction on stem research was granted last year, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-administration-appeals-stem-cell-research-block.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the injunction, arguing that the ruling was overbroad, endangering an array of research across multiple programs and centers while only serving a very attenuated economic interest of the plaintiffs in the case. While the appeals process was underway, the court granted a long-term stay which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-lifts-stem-cell-research-ban.php">allowed federal funding to continue</a> [JURIST report] while the court reached a decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Her visit was announced after last week's resignation of a German judge over statements made by the Cambodian government.

<p>Last week, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-urged-to-stop-political-interference-in-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">rights groups urged the UN</a> [JURIST report] to assure that Cambodia will not interfere in a tribunal established by the UN charged with investigating the communist Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s. The pressure for UN action results from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resignation of Siegfried Blunk</a> [JURIST report], one of the judges for the ECCC, who blamed political interference for his decision.

In <span class="casename">Doe #1 v. Reed</span>, the judge held that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that a reasonable probability of threats, harassment or reprisals exists as to the signers of R-71, now nearly two years after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">vote</a> [JURIST report] on R-71 in Washington state. The court held that the state's important interest in disclosure under the Public Records Act (PRA) prevails under exacting scrutiny. The opinion states:<blockquote>the Court finds that Doe's as-applied challenge cannot meet the threshold required to obtain an as-applied exemption to the PRA in this case. Doe's claim would also fail under the standards&#8212;if considered distinguishable from the applicable standards discussed above&#8212;articulated by a majority of the concurring Justices in the Supreme Court's opinion in Doe.</blockquote>Secretary of State Sam Reed, who supported disclosure of petitions under the state's voter-approved PRA, was pleased with Judge Benjamin Settle's opinion. 

<p>In June 2010, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-release-of-names-on-petition-does-not-violate-free-speech.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 8-1 in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-559">Doe #1 v. Reed</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] does not bar a state from releasing identifying information about petitioner signers where there is a sufficiently compelling state interest. The case arose over an order to publish the names of those who signed a Washington state petition to overturn a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/washington-passes-bill-expanding-rights.php">state law</a> [JURIST report] giving same-sex partners the same rights as married partners. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/28/09-35818.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the names should be released, but the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-blocks-release-of-names.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] in October 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, the court also found that the controversial Bush-era <a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/programs_and_policy/in_the_courts/final_usfws_4(d)_rule_for_polar_bears.pdf">special 4(d) rule</a> [text, PDF] in question violated the <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Protection Act</a> [official website] by not reviewing the potential harm to polar bears. Since the Obama administration rewrote the rule and reviewed it, the essential regulation still stands. The <A href = "http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href = "http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2011/polar-bear-10-17-2011.html">statement</a> [text] for the plaintiffs, a collective of environmental organizations:<blockquote>The court's decision is bittersweet&#8212;it acknowledges the devastating impact of global warming on polar bears and requires further review of the 4(d) rule, but stops short of fully disallowing an exemption for greenhouse gases. We will redouble our efforts to protect the polar bear's Arctic Ocean habitat, and continue to press the Obama administration to use all available tools, including the Endangered Species Act, to address greenhouse emissions and the climate crisis.</blockquote>Although polar bears are at an unendangered population now, a decision that was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-upholds-decision-listing-polar-bears-as-threatened.php">upheld in June</a> [JURIST report], it is predicted that <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQVABxNmx9P8xSlu8HhiGKdq0Mdg?docId=7cc320ff2ca6455282dc249e928af46a">melting ice caps will kill 10,000 of the species</a> [AP report].

<p>In 2009, the Obama administration received criticism for preserving the special 4(d) rule. <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] had received special permission from Congress to amend the rule, which prevented the use of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/esa73.pdf">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [text, PDF] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Polar bears are protected under the ESA, and environmentalists have argued that the release of greenhouse gases has contributed to global warming, which is destroying the polar bear's arctic habitat. The rule was put in place in December 2008 after the polar bear was listed as threatened on the endangered species list in May 2008. The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] made the designation more than two years after the Center for Biological Diversity, <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/">Greenpeace</a> and the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [advocacy websites] petitioned to protect the polar bear under the ESA. Shortly after that, then-Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that her office would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/alaska-filing-legal-challenge-to-polar.php">launch a court challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the listing of the polar bear on the endangered species list. Palin argued that the designation of the polar bear as "threatened" would have a negative impact on development in Alaska.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report indicated that more than half of the deportees were convicted criminals. In August, the US <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/us-to-review-deportations-in-300000-immigration-cases.php">drastically shifted immigration policy</A> [JURIST report] by putting 300,000 illegal immigrants' cases up for review and temporarily halting their deportation. A new DHS guideline revealed that illegal immigrants would be targeted for deportation based on being a security risk or having committed criminal activity.

<p>Despite being the province of the federal government, varying immigration laws have been proposed by several state legislatures, often resulting in lengthy court battles. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">blocked portions of a controversial Alabama immigration law</a> [JURIST report], which would require immigration status checks of public school students and make it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. A coalition of civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit earlier that week in an attempt to block South Carolina's immigration law that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">allows police officers to check a suspect's immigration status</a> [JURIST report] during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest, and mandates that businesses participate in the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the citizenship status of employees and job applicants. In August, the state of Arizona filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], on which the South Carolina and Alabama legislation is modeled.

Lopez, an opposition leader, is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9QEMUDG0.htm">considered to be a threat</a> [Bloomberg report] to current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">news archive</a>]. As a result of corruption allegations, he was banned from public office through 2014 by the country's comptroller general. However, a ruling by the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] restored Lopez's political right to run for office. Monday's decision by the high court has again revoked this right. In a <a href="http://www.tsj.gov.ve/informacion/notasdeprensa/notasdeprensa.asp?codigo=8847">statement</a> [text, in Spanish], the court summarized its reasons for overturning the decision of the IACHR. Among these was its belief that, where the provisions of the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Basicos/English/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm">American Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]&#8212;which created the IACHR and defines the human rights which the ratifying States, including Venezuela, have agreed to respect and ensure&#8212;conflict with those in the respective country's constitution, that conflict must be resolved by the high court.

<p>Last month, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/venezuela-president-criticizes-human-rights-court-ruling.php">criticized the IACHR</a> [JURIST report] for ruling in favor of Lopez. Chavez called the ruling <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2011/0918/In-Venezuela-top-Chavez-rival-sounds-confident-note-after-key-court-victory">politically motivated</a> [CSM report]. He further claimed that the Costa Rica-based international court is part of a system that protects corrupt behavior and is influenced by the US and the wealthy. The Venezuelan presidential primary election, where voters will select an opposition leader to challenge Chavez, will be held in February, and the presidential election will be held in October 2012. This is not the first time the Venezuelan government and the IACHR have disagreed. In June 2010, the IACHR sent a letter to the Venezuelan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-commission-concerned-over-freedom-of-expression-in-venezuela.php?goback=.nvr_3014631_2">expressing concern</a> [JURIST report] over the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/rights-commission-concerned-over-freedom-of-expression-in-venezuela.php?goback=.nvr_3014631_2">increasing threat to freedom of expression</a> [press release] in the country, citing three recent cases that caused particular concern. In February 2010, the IACHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/venezuela-government-violating-basic.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] providing a detailed analysis on the state of human rights in Venezuela, which ultimately concluded that not all citizens are ensured full enjoyment of their basic human rights. The top Venezuelan human rights official <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/g/paperchase/2010/02/venezuela-rights-chief-disputes.php">criticized the report</a> [JURIST report] and said that the report makes unfair characterizations and undermines Venezuelan democracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sali Rexhepi was charged with three counts of war crimes against the civilian population stemming from his membership and activity in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) but was found guilty on only one of those charges. The court, consisting of three judges, found Rexhepi guilty of the second count in which it was alleged that he "tortured Witness N, a Kosovo Albanian citizen detained in the Cahan detention center by attempting to obtain information and confessions from him while repeatedly beating him with wooden sticks." The other counts alleged similar mistreatment of civilians. As a result of the court's decision, Rexhepi was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and will also be required to reimburse the costs of the criminal proceedings. 

<p>Earlier this month, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] called for Kosovo to institute an <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-urges-witness-protection-program-in-kosovo.php">independent witness protection program</a> [JURIST report]. Spokesperson Rupert Colville made the comment in reaction to the <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=28&nav_id=76608">recent death of Agim Zogaj</a> [B92 report], a major witness for the prosecution against senior Kosovo politician and parliamentarian Fatmir Limaj. Limaj, a former member of the KLA, is awaiting trial on charges of war crimes stemming from the 1998-99 Kosovo war with Serbia. Zogaj, known as Witness X, was a KLA member under Limaj's direct command during the alleged <a href="http://www.balkanpeace.org/index.php?index=/content/testimonies/wctk/wctk07.incl">Klecka massacre</a> [Centre for Peace in the Balkans backgrounder]. Although authorities are still investigating, Zogaj's death has been tentatively ruled a suicide. Since Zogaj's death, at least one witness <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=09&dd=29&nav_id=76621">has decided not to testify</a> [B92 report]. EULEX has not commented on how severely this affects their case against Limaj and nine others, nor if it will delay the trial, which was expected to begin this month. </p>]]></content:encoded>

UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/SRTortureIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez</a> [official website] told the assembly members that governments should impose solitary confinement only in exceptional circumstances and for short periods of time. Mendez reported that solitary confinement, which he defined as "any regime where an inmate is held in isolation from others (except guards) for at least twenty-two hours a day," is subject to widespread abuse, and described instances of extreme isolation practices in countries such as Kazakhstan, China and the US. Mendez emphasized that isolating prisoners, especially young or mentally disabled detainees, can have a particularly deleterious effect:<blockquote>Solitary confinement is a harsh measure which is contrary to rehabilitation, the aim of the penitentiary system. ... Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pretrial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.</blockquote>Mendez enumerated recommendations and guidelines, including procedural safeguards and regular reviews of prison practices, for governments to minimize or altogether abolish the practice of solitary confinement.

<p>Poor prison conditions have drawn criticism worldwide. In July, jailed Iranian journalist <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile] <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/onlymehdi/O0QzEWBcteRm34lS1J986SdAkEfGni6OX9oU3we7Z7mOkO9UaRO3RcZJfaLK/Letter.doc">urged</a> [letter, DOC, in Persian] UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur Dr. Ahmad Shaheed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/imprisoned-iran-journalist-urges-un-probe-of-prison-conditions.php">investigate prison conditions in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. Saharkhiz alleged that the treatment of both political and general prisoners in Iran <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/jailed_iranian_journalist_appeals_to_un_rapporteur/24264623.html">amounts to crimes against humanity</a> [RFE/RL report]. At least 400 inmates at <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/PBSP.html">Pelican Bay State Prison</a> [official website] in California initiated a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/california-inmates-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-solitary-confinement.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in June in protest of solitary confinement. Inmates of Pelican Bay's Security Housing Unit (SHU), a long-term isolation ward where one-third of the prison's population is held in solitary confinement, are the instigators of the strike, and most of the strikers from other prisons are inmates in solitary confinement. The Washington Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/840393.opn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 in January that <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/washington-supreme-court-upholds-indefinite-solitary-confinement-for-death-row-prisoners.php">holding death row inmates in solitary confinement indefinitely</a> [JURIST report] is not an impermissible increase in the severity of punishment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Daniel Owens of the <a href="http://public.esquireempire.com/Oklahoma+County+District+Court+-+Oklahoma+County+Courthouse+in+Oklahoma+City,+Oklahoma">District Court of Oklahoma County</a> [official website] granted the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/getimage.tif?submitted=true&casemasterid=2787672&db=OKLAHOMA&barcode=1016581435">motion for a temporary injunction</a> [text, PDF] filed earlier this month by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> and the <a href="http://ocrj.org/">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice</a> (OCRJ) [advocacy websites], which argued that placing restrictions on the use of abortion-inducing drugs violates the equal protection clause of the <a href="http://oklegal.onenet.net/okcon/">Oklahoma Constitution</a> [text]. The act would require doctors prescribing abortion drugs to meet stricter requirements, including administering the drug on location in the medical facility, scheduling mandatory follow-up appointments, explaining drug labels to patients and reporting possible negative drug reactions to the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Doctors who fail to meet one of the new requirements would be subject to professional sanctions and could be liable in legal actions taken by the mother, father or maternal grandparents of the aborted fetus. Plaintiffs argued in their petition that the new law does not serve a legitimate government interest and <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/getimage.tif?submitted=true&casemasterid=2787672&db=OKLAHOMA&barcode=1016582074">jeopardizes the safety of women seeking abortions</a> [petition, PDF]. The law was scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2011, but will be suspended pending further court action.

<p>Over the last year, Oklahoma has increased the restrictiveness of its abortion laws. In April, Oklahoma <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/About/index.html">Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1888">House Bill 1888</a> [materials], prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks. The law allows abortions past the 20-week mark only in certain extenuating circumstances where the mother faces death or serious injury. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but the woman undergoing the procedure would not face a penalty. Last year, an Oklahoma state judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">extended a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking enforcement of a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009%2D10bills/hb/hb2780%5Fenr.rtf">law</a> [HB 2780 text, RTF] that would require women seeking abortions to have an ultrasound and hear a description of the fetus. In May 2010, the Oklahoma <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] voted to override the veto of a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/SB/hb3284_sflr.rtf">bill</a> [HB 3284 text, RTF] that would require women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire, answering questions such as marital status, reasons for seeking the abortion, and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icty-may-hold-two-trials-for-mladic.php">sought to separate the indictment</a> [JURIST report] in order to hold one trial for Mladic's conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10824">denied</a> [press release] the prosecutor's request last week on the grounds that separating the trials would be inefficient and could prejudice Mladic and unduly burden witnesses. Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz had argued that <a href="http://newsok.com/prosecutor-wont-appeal-mladic-trial-decision/article/feed/308574?custom_click=pod_headline_europe">splitting the trials was warranted</a> [AP report] because Mladic's health may decline over the course of the trial. Brammertz indicated that he would streamline the charges against Mladic in an effort to expedite the trial, which is likely to begin next year.

<p>Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. At his <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">second appearance</a> [JURIST report] he refused to enter a plea. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for allegedly ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war, the largest European genocide since the Holocaust.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), Citigroup's principal US broker-dealer, marketed and sold in 2007 a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that defaulted fewer than nine months after it closed. CGMI <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/19/citigroup-sec-idUSN1E79I12520111019">allegedly misled investors</a> [Reuters report] about the strength of the the CDO, named Class V Funding III, and failed to reveal that the company "had exercised significant influence over the selection of $500 million of the assets" in the CDO portfolio, and that it had taken a short position in those assets, essentially meaning it had placed bets elsewhere in the financial markets that the CDO would fail. The SEC summarized in its complaint:<blockquote>By taking a short position with respect to the assets that it had helped select, Citigroup profited from the poor performance of those assets, while investors in Class V III suffered losses. The CDO securities on which Citigroup bought protection had a notional value of approximately $500 million, representing half of the Class V III investment portfolio. The marketing materials Citigroup prepared and distributed to investors did not disclose Citigroup's role in selecting assets for Class V III and did not accurately disclose to investors Citigroup&#8217;s short position on those assets. ... By engaging in the conduct described herein, [CGMI] violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ... by negligently misrepresenting key deal terms.</blockquote>Citigroup allegedly represented that the collateral manager of the CDO, a unit at <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en/">Credit Suisse Group AG</a> [corporate website], had independently selected the assets, while in reality about half had actually been selected by CGMI with the intention of taking the short position. Upon default Class V Funding III left the investors with losses even though Citigroup netted $160 million in fees and profits. Under the terms of the settlement, which still requires approval from US District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan, Citigroup will disgorge the $160 million of alleged improper fees and profits, plus $30 million of interest, and pay a $95 million fine. Credit Suisse has agreed to settle with the SEC  for $2.5 million. Citigroup settled without admitting wrongdoing.

<p>Citigroup's settlement is the third between the SEC and a major bank accused of marketing a CDO without disclosing a short position or allowing investors to take one. In June <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled similar fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] for $153.6 million. The settlement included a $133 million fine and $20.6 million representing fraudulent profits and interest. In July 2010, <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goldman+sachs">news archive</a>] agreed to a $550 million settlement with the SEC to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">resolve charges</a> [JURIST report] that the firm marketed a subprime mortgage product and made misleading statements and omissions to investors in early 2007. Of the $550 million settlement, $300 million was to be paid to the US Treasury and $250 million disgorged to harmed investors. The penalty was the largest against a financial company in SEC history. Additionally, in December 2010 <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/bank-of-america-reaches-137-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled with the SEC</a> [JURIST report] for $137 million, although the case did not involve investor fraud charges. There BOA was charged with using anti-competitive transactions with 20 state municipalities, putting at risk the tax-exempt status of municipal securities by establishing fraudulent fair market values using "improper bidding practices" between 1998 and 2002.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1248398.pdf">issued a resolution</a> [decision, PDF; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/4530910C-6874-4F4E-BCBE-34B1D71E539A.htm">press release</a>] that asks Malawi authorities to report "any observations" regarding the country's alleged failure to comply with cooperation requests sent by the ICC regarding arrest warrants for al-Bashir issued in 2009 and 2010. Malawi, being a state party to the Rome Statute since September 2002, and thus a member of the ICC, is under obligation to abide by such ICC cooperation requests in accordance with the statute. In addition to the cooperation requests issued generally, in anticipation of al-Bashir's arrival in Malawi, the ICC Registrar sent a <em>note verbale</em> to the Embassy of the Republic of Malawi in Brussels on October 13, reminding the nation of its legal obligations under the statute and asking for its cooperation with the arrest and surrender of al-Bashir. The <em>note</em> also invited Malawi to consult with the ICC over perceived difficulties in facilitating al-Bashir's arrest, but consultation by Malawi authorities has yet to take place. The ICC has issued two international warrants for al-Bashir's arrest on a total of 10 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Under the Rome Statute, ICC member nations that do not comply with cooperation requests can be referred to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] for non-cooperation.

<p>Al-Bashir remains an extremely controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the Darfur conflict. Most recently, al-Bashir announced this month that Sudan will <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sudan-to-adopt-islamic-constitution.php">adopt an Islamic constitution</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], in a press release on the day of al-Bashir's visit, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-group-urges-malawi-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">urged Malawi to arrest the Sudanese president</a> [JURIST report] and surrender him to the ICC for prosecution. In June, AI urged Malaysia to withdraw an invitation for al-Bashir to participate in an event there and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">arrest him if he travels to the country</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June, ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo issued a statement claiming that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur. In May, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">ICC urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] while he visited that year for a second time. Previously, al-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] Libyan opposition forces on Thursday captured and killed former leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] in his hometown of Sirte, Libyan <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=8&amp;ParentID=3&amp;LangID=1">Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril</a> [official profile] confirmed at a press conference. Military forces loyal to the newly formed government, the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&amp;ParentID=0&amp;LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [website], <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011102092329271942.html">took control of Sirte</a> [Al Jazeera report] on Thursday and soon after found, captured and killed Gaddafi. The cause of death is unknown, but eyewitnesses claim that he <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/20/501364/main20123114.shtml">died from gunshot wounds</a> [AP report]. Also on Thursday, Libyan Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html">confirmed the death</a> [Al Jazeera report] of Gaddafi's son, Mutassim Gaddafi. Officials have also announced the arrests of Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and former Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim. Libyan civilians and NTC officials celebrated the news of Gaddafi's death, and several world leaders expressed relief and support for Libya. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] said the day marked "an historic transition" for the country and urged Libyans to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40120&amp;Cr=Libya&amp;Cr1=">stop fighting and promote peace</a> [UN News Centre report].

Gaddafi's death marks the latest milestone in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] as part of a wider protest movement that had spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Gaddafi and his supporters have been on the run since August, when rebel forces supported by the NTC captured the capital city of Tripoli. Earlier in the summer, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi for crimes against humanity, although some commentators suggested that Gaddafi <a href="/forum/2011/09/charles-adeogun-phillips-libya.php">should face trial in Libya</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] published a 92-page report saying that Libyan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">committed crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] under Gaddafi's direct orders during the conflict, including acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." Gaddafi ruled Libya as a dictator for 42 years after taking power in a coup, and was known for his eccentricity and for the tight control he kept over the country.]]></content:encoded>

Al-Habib criticized the report for being <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/201110205193213355.html">poorly sourced, non-neutral and simply untrue</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The report cited an increase in persecutions among political activists and journalists, detention conditions for opposition leaders and their wives, the torture and mistreatment of detainees, the significant administration of the death penalty to people under 18 years of age and "exorbitant bail requirements" for human rights defenders and religious practitioners. However, UN Special Rapporteur on Iran Ahmed Shaheed, the author of the report, stated that he was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40125&Cr=iran&Cr1=">encouraged by Iran's willingness to cooperate with him</a> [UN News Centre Report] and that Iran "needs to be seen in a better light." He further focused on the need to maintain dialogue with Iran's political leaders in order to improve conditions in the country. The US issued a statement on Tuesday <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/10/175789.htm">denouncing Iran's "'intensified' campaign of abuse"</a> [press release]: "Under international law and its own constitution, Iran has committed to protect and defend the rights of its people, but officials continue to stifle all forms of dissent, persecute religious and ethnic minorities, harass and intimidate human rights defenders, and engage in the torture of detainees."

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized for its alleged human rights abuses. Jailed Iranian journalist <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile] in July <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/onlymehdi/O0QzEWBcteRm34lS1J986SdAkEfGni6OX9oU3we7Z7mOkO9UaRO3RcZJfaLK/Letter.doc">urged</a> [letter, DOC, in Persian] Shaheed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/imprisoned-iran-journalist-urges-un-probe-of-prison-conditions.php">investigate prison conditions in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. In May, rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-criticize-iran-detention-of-lawyers.php">decried</a> [JURIST report] Iran's persecution of lawyers. In January, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran [official website] claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. In January, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Also in January, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report] for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted in Germany</a> [JURIST report] in May on <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i7tDWgX7PqVxzdHdTs-U5T55b0hw?docId=37cfaa589946492a930a6b1bb5a5705e">more than 28,000 counts of accessory to murder</a> [AP report]. Demjanjuk argues that the US government failed to turn over a 1985 FBI report suggesting that his Nazi ID card used against him at trial could potentially have been a Soviet-made fake. Demjanjuk requested a stay in his trial to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alleged-nazi-guard-requests-suspension-of-trial-to-investigate-declassified-fbi-report.php">investigate the FBI report</a> [JURIST report] but was denied by the trial judge. After his conviction in May, Germany denied a request from Spain to have Demjanjuk <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/germany-court-rejects-spain-demjanjuk-extradition-request.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] so that he could stand trial in Spain on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.

<p>The five-year sentence Demjanjuk received in May was less than the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">six years sought by the prosecution</a> [JURIST report], and he was released after being convicted. Judge Ralph Alt ordered his release because of his advanced age and because the verdict is not final. Demjanjuk's trial, which <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009, was marked by extensive delay. Last May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals relating to his health</a> [JURIST reports], although the court limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was deported to Germany after the US <a thref="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking before the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/lords-constitution-committee/">Lords Constitution Committee</a> [official website], Judge suggested that while UK courts are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/oct/20/senior-judge-doubts-european-court?newsfeed=true">not required to follow the ECHR</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], they should consider ECHR decisions when deciding cases.

UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] has expressed frustration at previous ECHR decisions and may use the UK's upcoming presidency of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> [official website] to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8836487/Courts-need-not-be-bound-by-Europe-says-top-judge.html">influence changes in the court</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report]. 

<p>The UK government and the ECHR have faced increasing conflict. In March, the UK <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/index.htm">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] announced the creation of a commission, suggested by Cameron, which will consider the <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease180311a.htm">implementation of a British Bill of Rights</a> [statement, text]. Former UK Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf has warned that a Bill of Rights would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-judge-warns-proposed-bill-of-rights-could-further-conflict-between-uk-echr.php">conflict</a> [JURIST report] with the European Convention on Human Rights, which the UK has incorporated into its law. While the government has not stated an intention to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, Woolf warned that continued adherence to the convention combined with the creation of Bill of Rights would create complications for judges in determining which to follow and further the existing conflict between the UK and the ECHR. Cameron suggested the creation of the commission in February after the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-parliament-rejects-prisoner-voting-rights-despite-echr-ruling.php">voted to reject</a> an ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/british-prisoners-may-be-given-right.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] and continue preventing prisoners from voting in British elections. The following month, the UK government took legal action to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/uk-to-appeal-echr-ruling-on-prisoner-voting-rights.php">overturn</a> [JURIST report] the ECHR ruling. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a meeting in with Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister Sok An to discuss recent developments at the tribunal&#8212;the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>]&#8212;O'Brien expressed concern and reiterated the call to respect the integrity and independence of the tribunal. In an official statement, her office noted:<blockquote>The Legal Counsel strongly urged the Royal Government of Cambodia to refrain from statements opposing the progress of Cases 003 and 004 and to refrain from interfering in any way whatsoever with the judicial process. She emphasized the obligation of the Royal Government of Cambodia to cooperate fully with the ECCC.</blockquote>The pressure for UN action results from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resignation of Siegfried Blunk</a> [JURIST report], one of the judges for the ECCC, who blamed political interference for his decision.

<p>Earlier this week, the UN-backed ECCC announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-begin-khmer-rouge-trial-in-november.php">trial of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders will begin</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, November 21.

Arrest procedures documented include arrests in the middle of the night, removal of child from parents for questioning, abusive treatment in detention, and conviction procedures that appear to preclude findings of not guilty.</blockquote>Falk indicated prolonged occupation is deforming child development because of "pervasive deprivations affecting health, education, and overall security." The special rapporteur urged Israel to adopt guidelines in line with international humanitarian and human rights standards.

<p>Israel has faced ongoing criticism from the UN and international human rights groups for its action in the Palestinian territories, which have been under Israeli military control since 1967. Last month, Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmet Davutoglu said that <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/turkey-seeks-legal-intervention-regarding-flotilla-incident-gaza-blockade.php">Turkey will sue Israel</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] over the legality of Israel's Gaza Strip blockade. Also last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-report-criticizes-israel-for-flotilla-raid.php">UN criticized Israel for using excessive force</a> [JURIST report] during a May 2010 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=flotilla">flotilla incident</a> [JURIST news archive], in which Israeli forces raided several Turkish ships bound for the blockaded Gaza Strip. In June, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/israeli-forces-kill-18-protesters-syrian-tv-043810558.html">condemned the killings of between 30 and 40 protesters</a> [Reuters report] which had been killed by Israeli security forces along the ceasefire line between occupied borders. Nearly 20 civilian protesters were reportedly killed during a protest on June 5 marking the anniversary of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html">1967 Middle East war</a> [NPR backgrounder]. In January, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">UN official alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Israeli authorities had committed several illegal acts in the Palestinian territories since the start of the year, making the prospect of a viable Palestinian state unlikely. </p>]]></content:encoded>

While the judge stated that the biological father, identified as "H", would <a href="http://www.calgarysun.com/2011/10/19/groundbreaking-ruling-in-gay-custody-case">remain the legal parent</a> [<em>Calgary Sun</em> report] of the unidentified eight-year-old girl, the non-biological father, identified as "R", will maintain physical guardianship over the girl. R has been acting as the primary caregiver of the girl since 2006. In order for R to obtain parental status, the judge stated that he will have to pursue a constitutional challenge over the limitations placed on rights of gay non-biological parents. The girl's biological mother, identified as "D", also maintains her parental status. In her decision, the judge stated that a clear gap exists in Alberta's <a href="http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/go/CourtServices/FamilyJusticeServices/FamilyLawAct/tabid/127/Default.aspx">Family Law Act</a> [materials], which fails to legally define gay men as fathers. 

<p>The US court system is also being utilized to expand the scope of gay parental rights. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/the-supreme-court-has-a-big-day.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a case involving a same-sex couple who want both their names on the birth certificate of an adopted child. Though adopted in New York, the child was born in Louisiana, where the couple was refused their request. The couple appealed, and, in April, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/fifth-circuit-strikes-order-to-put-names-of-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">ruled <em>en banc</em> against the parents</a> [JURIST report], finding that "adoption is not a fundamental right," and that "Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children." In May 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/">New York Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/new-york-high-court-expands-rights-of-nonbiological-gay-parents.php">issued two rulings</a> [JURIST report] expanding the rights of non-biological gay and lesbian parents. In one case the court determined that a lesbian can assert parental rights over the biological child of her partner, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-partner.php">reversing a lower court decision</a> [JURIST report]. In the second case, the court ruled that a lesbian could seek child support from her former partner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Libya_Complaint_Master.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/lawmakers-file-suit-against-obama-for-continuing-actions-in-libya.php">filed by the congressmen</a> [JURIST report] in June, stated that "[t]he Libyan operations ordered by President Obama constitute "war" for the purpose of Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution. President Obama prosecuted the war without a declaration of Congress with the use of funds never approved for such a war." Judge Reggie Walton ruled that the legislators lacked standing to challenge the military action because they have an adequate remedy available to them through legislative means. Walton stated that because the legislators have had the opportunity to vote on ending the Libyan action, "[t]hey have not demonstrated that they are without a legislative remedy." Walton also chided the legislators for seeking a remedy through the courts:<blockquote>While there may conceivably be some political benefit in suing the President and the Secretary of Defense, in light of shrinking judicial budgets, scarce judicial resources, and a heavy caseload, the Court finds it frustrating to expend time and effort adjudicating the relitigation of settled questions of law. The Court does not mean to imply that the judiciary should be anything but open and accommodating to all members of society, but is simply expressing its dismay that the plaintiffs are seemingly using the limited resources of this Court to achieve what appear to be purely political ends, when it should be clear to them that this Court is powerless to depart from clearly established precedent of the Supreme Court and the District of Columbia Circuit.</blockquote>Walton specifically noted that Representative <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov/">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) [official website] was involved in a similar lawsuit filed against former president George W. Bush in 2002, following Bush's withdrawal form the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That suit was also dismissed for lack of standing. 

<p>The court's ruling came as Obama was announcing the death of former Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>]. Gaddafi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">captured and killed</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday after military forces loyal to the newly formed government, the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [website], <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011102092329271942.html">took control of Sirte</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Gaddafi's death marks the latest milestone in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] as part of a wider protest movement that had spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Gaddafi and his supporters have been on the run since August, when rebel forces supported by the NTC captured the capital city of Tripoli. Earlier in the summer, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi for crimes against humanity, although some commentators suggested that Gaddafi <a href="/forum/2011/09/charles-adeogun-phillips-libya.php">should face trial in Libya</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] published a 92-page report saying that Libyan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">committed crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] under Gaddafi's direct orders during the conflict, including acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." Gaddafi ruled Libya as a dictator for 42 years after taking power in a coup, and was known for his eccentricity and for the tight control he kept over the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rupert Colville, the spokesman for UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] told reporters that there needs to be an investigation into whether Gaddafi was killed during fighting with the rebels or if this was an execution. The OHCHR's call for an investigation into the killing of Gaddafi comes amid contradictory accounts and <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7LL1HR20111021">uncertainty</a> [Reuters report] about how exactly the killing of Gaddafi took place. Colville said that there are four or five versions of how he died but no clear conclusion has been reached. The first image taken of Gaddafi depicts him being captured alive, while the next one shows him dead. In the laws of war, there is a clear difference between someone being killed during combat and being summarily executed. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions</a> [official website] said that states need to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11516&LangID=E">respect international standards</a> [press release] on the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40136&Cr=heyns&Cr1=">use of lethal force during an arrest</a> [UN News Centre report]. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] on Friday also urged for an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/libya-urged-investigate-whether-al-gaddafi-death-was-war-crime-2011-10-21">investigation into Gaddafi's death</a> [press release]. AI stated that it would be a war crime if Gaddafi were deliberately killed after capture. There are several different accounts of what happened along with two videos of Gaddafi's death, but the factual account of the killing remains unclear.

<p>Libyan <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=8&ParentID=3&LangID=1">Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril</a> [official profile] confirmed at a press conference Thursday that Libyan opposition forces on captured and killed former leader Gaddafi. The cause of death is unknown, but eyewitnesses claim that he died from gunshot wounds. Also on Thursday, Libyan Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam confirmed the death of Gaddafi's son, Mutassim Gaddafi. Officials have also announced the arrests of Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and former Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim, although later reports indicated that Saif al-Islam remains at large. Libyan civilians and <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] officials celebrated the news of Gaddafi's death, and several world leaders expressed relief and support for Libya. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] said the day marked "an historic transition" for the country and urged Libyans to stop fighting and promote peace. Gaddafi's death marks the latest milestone in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] as part of a wider protest movement that had spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed a <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/document-preview.aspx?doc_id=100252986">lawsuit</a> [complaint, text] Thursday in <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] challenging Wisconsin's new voter identification law as a violation of the <a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/wisconst.pdf">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief in challenging the constitutionality of parts of Wisconsin Act 23 passed in 2011. The controversial voter identification law states that any qualified voter must present photo identification at the polls in order to vote in Wisconsin elections for local, state, or federal offices, or referenda. Plaintiffs argue that the new law will place a burden on electors who do not posses a state ID card, who then need to appear in person at the DMV, present proof of identity and pay a fee. The complaint states that the new photo ID requirement will not prevent voting by those ineligible after a conviction, nor will it prevent electors from voting more than once. Plaintiffs assert that Article II, Section 2 of the Wisconsin Constitution provide the exclusive basis for constitutional requirements for voting. The complaint alleges: <blockquote>The Wisconsin Constitution does not authorize the Legislature to exclude an elector from the right of suffrage for any reason other than those set out in Article II, Section 2, or to impose additional qualifications on the right to vote that are not expressly set out by Article II, Sec. 1.</blockquote>The Wisconsin government now has <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/article_85f82e70-fb46-11e0-b1f3-001cc4c03286.html?mode=more">45 days to respond</a> [<em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> report] to the lawsuit. The state can allow the case to proceed in circuit court or petition the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly. 

<p>There are now 30 US states that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August, South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-democrats-protest-against-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking for the rejection of the state's new voter identification law. The caucus argued that the law, which requires South Carolina residents to present a current government-issued ID, is too restrictive and may disenfranchise African Americans and elderly voters. The objection followed earlier <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">attempts by several South Carolina civil rights groups</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the law from being implemented. In October 2010, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. The court held that the law, Proposition 200, was inconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] on <a href="http://www.ccij.ca/media/news-releases/2011/index.php?DOC_INST=7">torture charges</a> [press release]. Bush was in Surrey on Thursday to attend the <a href="http://www.surrey.ca/summit">Surrey Regional Economic Summit</a> [official website]. According to the CCIJ, the four men, three of whom have since been released without any formal charges ever being brought against them, endured "horrific and illegal" treatment while being detained at military bases in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. CCIJ alleges that Bush violated the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text]. Former UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, stated:<blockquote>The main aim of the [CAT] was to eradicate safe havens for persons who commit, order, or participate in acts of torture worldwide. States parties to the Convention, including Canada, have a legal obligation to arrest all persons suspected of torture with the aim of bringing them to justice. There is plenty of evidence that President Bush authorized enhanced interrogation methods against suspected terrorists, some of which clearly amount to torture, such as waterboarding.</blockquote>The CCIJ, along with the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-groups-file-canadian-indictment-against-bush-for-torture.php">initially filed an indictment against Bush</a> [JURIST report] in September accusing Bush of sanctioning enforced disappearances, secret detention and a variety of acts of torture.

<p>Calls for the investigation or arrest of former president Bush have largely been rejected. In February, the CCR and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.eu/">European Center for Human Rights</a> (ECCHR) [advocacy websites] urged the signatory states of the CAT to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges against the former president</a> [JURIST report]. The call came as the rights groups announced that <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/FINAL%207%20Feb%20BUSH%20INDICTMENT.pdf">two criminal complaints</a> [text, PDF] were to be filed in Switzerland against Bush before he canceled his trip to the country. Calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">consistently rejected by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] urged US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Bush for violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340---A000-.html">federal statute prohibiting torture</a> [18 USC &#167; 2340A]. Also citing his memoir, the ACLU argued that the use of waterboarding has historically been prosecuted as a crime in the US. The letter also argued that failure to investigate Bush would harm the US's ability to advocate for human rights in other countries. Bush's secretary of defense <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Donald+Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] has also faced possible criminal charges in Europe, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to create fractures in rocks, which allows trapped gas and oil to come to surface. Environmental and health concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing include contamination of ground water, migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface and the potential mishandling of waste. Currently there is no comprehensive set of national regulations governing the disposal of wastewater from the fracking process. The EPA said that its plan to institute new regulations in this area falls in line with US President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/blueprint_secure_energy_future.pdf">Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/blueprint-secure-energy-future">official website</a>]. The Blueprint calls for a three-part process for reducing American dependence on oil and to develop cleaner sources of energy: "safely and responsibly" develop domestic energy supplies, give consumers more choices to reduce costs and save energy, and develop clean energy technology. Specifically to fracking, the Blueprint offers three goals for responsibly developing natural gas extraction:<blockquote><ul>
	<li>Disclosure of Fracking Chemicals: The Administration is calling on industry to be more 
transparent about the use of fracking chemicals.</li>
<li>Leading by Example:  In April, DOI will hold a series of regional public meetings to discuss 
the potential for expanding shale gas production on Federal lands. These events will 
provide a forum to develop a framework for responsible production on public lands.</li>
<li>Research: The Federal government will conduct research to examine the impacts of fracking 
on water resources. At Congress' direction, EPA will continue with its study of fracturing 
impacts on drinking water and surface water, and DOE will likewise sponsor research on 
these issues.</li>
</ul></blockquote>Extraction of natural gas from shale formations has grown to 15 percent of the total US production of natural gas and this figure is expected to triple within the next decade. The EPA has stated that the goal of the new regulations is to protect Americans' health while at the same time ensuring access to important energy resources.

<p>The recent growth in hydraulic fracturing technology for the extraction of natural gas from shale formations has been a controversial issue in the US. In June the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/Default.asp">New Jersey Legislature</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-jersey-legislature-passes-ban-on-shale-gas-fracking.php">completely banned hydraulic fracturing</a> [JURIST report], although it was largely just a symbolic gesture since New Jersey sits over a very small portion of shale gas. Earlier that month, the New York attorney general filed a complaint against the EPA for <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-ag-sues-us-government-for-failure-to-study-fracking-impact.php">failing to study the impact of fracking</a> [JURIST report]. Fracking has also been controversial internationally. In May, France's lower house, the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French], approved a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/ta/ta0658.asp">bill</a> [TA Bill No. 658, <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/interdiction_exploration_exploitation_hydrocarbures_non_conventionnels.asp">materials</a>, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-lower-house-approves-ban-on-shale-gas-tapping.php">report</a>] to prohibit the drilling of gas and oil through hydraulic fracturing and to repeal hydraulic fracturing licenses granted to companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Heyns made a report to the UN the General Assembly saying that "International standards provide adequate room for States to pursue their legitimate security interests, both at home and abroad," and warned that abusing these standards to reach short-term goals could cause "long-term damage to the protection of human rights." Heyns said that: <blockquote>While it is correct that lethal force should not be used unless there is a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed a crime involving serious violence, or has threatened to do so, that is not enough. For deadly force to be used by the police, there must be an immediate or ongoing threat to the public if the person were to escape.</blockquote> Heyns also warned that the use of unmanned drones for targeted killings is dangerous because it leads to a "global war without borders, in which no one is safe." He called for an international discussion on the growing use of unmanned drones.

<p>The United States has been at the center of controversy with using lethal force to arrest international terror suspects and the targeted killings of terrorist leaders with unmanned drone strikes.

Morant and Handcock were convicted through a court martial of murdering Boer civilians and sentenced to death by firing squad 18 hours later. McClelland believes there are issues of judicial fairness that need to be confronted:<blockquote>There was a range of material, for instance in the court of enquiry which was held before the court martial, the accused weren't provided with any legal representation. That enquiry also heard evidence that wasn't provided to the accused. The defense lawyer was engaged with essentially one day's notice. The prosecution had three months and the defense lawyer was put in a conflict of interest representing all three accused rather the accused having separate representation. ... I am advised indeed by government lawyers that if established they would also be heinous breaches of the procedures of 1902.</blockquote>McClelland differentiated the case from previous unsuccessful attempts as looking solely at procedural defects rather than questioning whether or not Morant and Handcock had British orders to shoot the prisoners. He further stated he wanted to make clear to Britain <a href = "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-21/government-to-raise-breaker-morant-case/3592014">that questions still exist about the government's fair treatment of the Australian soldiers</a> [ABC News report]. Last year, Britain's Secretary of State for Defense, Liam Fox, rejected a petition for pardons brought by several members of Australian parliament.

<p>Morant and Handcock remain the only Australian citizens convicted of war crimes, when they executed Boer civilians and a German missionary in 1901. Both Morant and Handcock claimed they were ordered by British commanders to "take no prisoners" and thus were not culpable for the deaths. A third Australian soldier, George Whitton, was convicted for the murders but was not executed after King George VII  received a petition from 80,000 Australian citizens asking for mercy. Morant was well-known as a poet, and his death has been seen by many Australians as an injustice, and a symbol of the United Kingdom's destructive colonial rule over the nation. Despite the support behind absolving Morant and Handcock, many disagree with seeking a pardon for the pair. McClelland admitted that, British orders or not, the two murdered civilians, an act that was unacceptable. The <a href = "http://www.ada.asn.au">Australian Defense Association</a> [advocacy website] described the petition as <a href = "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/bid-to-clear-breaker-morant-arrogant-says-defence-lobby-group/story-e6frg6nf-1226172982387">arrogant</a> [<em>The Australian</em> report]. Although often regarded as a folk hero in Australia, Morant is viewed in South Africa as a war criminal and citizens have been <a href = "http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/287483">critical of attempts to pardon the duo</a> [<em>Digital Journal</em> report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Roadless Rule blocks road-building and commercial timber harvesting on expanses of roadless areas around the country, primarily the National Forests. The <a href = "http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Services</a> (NFS) and the <a href = "http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> [official websites] argued that promulgation of the Roadless Rule did not violate the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC4321">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) and the <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=legisAct">Wilderness Act</a> [texts], and that they believed a national prohibition on the law was inappropriate. The court agreed that a national injunction was not permissible, and that the agencies had leverage to enforce the Roadless Rule:<blockquote>[A]gencies have considerable discretion to define the purposes and objectives of a proposed action, as long as they are reasonable. In this action, the Forest Service stated that the defined purpose of the Roadless Rule was, to provide long-term "protect[ion] [of] the values prevalent in roadless areas" by "immediately stop[ping] activities that have the greatest likelihood of degrading desirable characteristics of [IRAs]."... To achieve the defined purpose of the proposed rule, "the agency determined that only those uses and activities that are likely to significantly alter landscapes and cause landscape fragmentation on a national scale [would] be considered for prohibition in this proposal." [...] Unlike the district court, we will defer to the Forest Service's judgment on this issue. Accordingly, we find that the Forest Service reasonably limited the detailed alternatives analysis to the three alternatives&#8212;in addition to the required "no action" alternative&#8212;that prohibited road construction, because any alternative permitting road construction to a greater extent would not further the defined objective of the Roadless Rule and would therefore not be "reasonable."</blockquote><a href = "http://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website], who argued the case for a number of environmental groups, <a href = "http://earthjustice.org/blog/2011-october/major-victory-court-reinstates-roadless-rule">praised</a> [press release] the decision as a major victory: "There's mostly bad news in the headlines these days; this is most definitely of the other kind." However, a defender of the injunction, the <a href = "http://www.coloradomining.org">Colorado Mining Association</a> [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.coloradomining.org/Content/Release_Pdf/NewsRelease.Roadless102111.pdf">stated</a> [press release, PDF] that the ruling threatens mining jobs in the region, as well as limiting access to vital minerals.

<p>The Roadless Conservation Area Rule was implemented by former president Bill Clinton in 2001 and replaced by the Bush administration in 2005. The Clinton-era rule would have prohibited mining, logging, and road construction in the forests of 38 states and Puerto Rico, totaling more than 58 million acres of land. The Clinton administration measure was <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/new-rule-allows-road-construction-on.php">effectively overturned</a> [JURIST report]  in 2005 by the <a href="http://fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5052609.pdf">State Petitions Rule</a> [text], enacted by the US <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> [official website] under President George W Bush. The State Petitions Rule allowed governors to petition for Roadless Rule protections, depending on their individual state needs, in lieu of blanket protection. The US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in 2009 affirmed a district court ruling <a href = "/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-prohibits-construction.php">reinstating the Roadless Rule</a> [JURIST report], a decision <a href="/hotline/2009/08/ninth-circuit-ruling-to-reinstate.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST op-ed] by JURIST Hotline contributor Mike Dubrasich, Executive Director of the <a href="http://westinstenv.org/">Western Institute for Study of the Environment</a> [advocacy website]. In March of 2009, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/us-congress-approves-land-and-water.php">voted to approve</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.00146:">Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009</a> [HR 146 materials], a collection of more than 160 bills aimed at preserving federal land as wilderness areas.

While the court ruled that Arizona had standing to bring the counterclaim, the court barred several counts in the claim because they had already been litigated before the court in a 1995 case. The court also held that Arizona failed to state valid claims and the claims would be dismissed, even if they had not already been precluded from litigation, because they offered political instead of legal questions. Brewer issued a statement Friday <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_102111_CounterclaimDismissed.pdf">criticizing the decision</a> [text, PDF] and expressing hope that the case will appear before the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] last year against Brewer seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. 

<p>The controversial Arizona immigration law has influenced other anti-immigration laws in states such as <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST reports]. Some critics have argued that the stricter state immigration laws <a href="/forum/2011/03/can-state-immigration-laws-ever-mirror-federal-immigration-policy.php">do not comply with federal law</a> [JURIST op-ed] and only serve to complicate the system. Earlier this month, the DOJ filed a motion in the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/about/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">halt enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of a controversial <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">Alabama immigration law</a> [HB 56 text] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants. The law requires school officials to verify the immigration status of children and parents, authorizes police to detain an individual and ask for papers if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" that the driver is in the country illegally, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. Since the legislation passed, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">16 countries have filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jibril made the announcement in front of thousands of supporters celebrating in the city of Benghazi, the location of the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [website] and where the first uprisings sparked the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature] eight months ago. Jibril and other NTC officials thanked the opposition fighters, as well as international organizations like the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> [official website], for their support during the conflict and pledged to create an interim government within a month and to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/201110235316778897.html">hold elections</a> [Al Jazeera report] in eight months.

The declaration of liberation comes three days after <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">Gaddafi's capture and death</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of opposition forces in his hometown of Sirte. Gaddafi's body has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/22/idINIndia-60068020111022">been on display</a> [Reuters report: graphic content] since Friday in the city of Misrata, drawing large crowds of visitors wanting to see the body and take photos. Jibril also announced on Sunday that they would <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Gaddafis-body-to-be-handed-over-to-his-relatives-NTC/articleshow/10464596.cms">release Gaddafi's body</a> [TOI report] to his extended relatives for burial in a location to be determined by the NTC and Gaddafi's family.

<p>Libyan civilians and NTC officials continue to celebrate the news of Gaddafi's death, and several world leaders have expressed relief and support for Libya. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] said this week that Gaddafi's death marked "an historic transition" for the country and urged Libyans to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40120&Cr=Libya&Cr1=">stop fighting and promote peace</a> [UN News Centre report]. On Friday, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-office-calls-for-investigation-into-gaddafi-killing.php">called for a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Gaddafi's death, a request that came amid contradictory accounts and <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7LL1HR20111021">uncertainty</a> [Reuters report] about how exactly the killing took place. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions</a> [official website] said that states need to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11516&LangID=E">respect international standards</a> [press release] on the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40136&Cr=heyns&Cr1=">use of lethal force during an arrest</a> [UN News Centre report].

The lawsuit is based on a <a href="http://www.unep.org/">UN Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) [official website] <a href="http://www.unep.org/nigeria/">report</a> [materials] assessing the impact of oil contamination on the environment and public health in Ogoniland, a village in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The report, which was published in August, found high levels of the carcinogen benzene as well as several inches of refined oil floating in groundwater that the village uses for drinking water. The UN investigators suggested that both Royal Dutch Shell and the Nigerian state-run oil company were responsible for the pollution, though Royal Dutch Shell abandoned the area in 1993. The complaint, which was filed in the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website], contends that Royal Dutch Shell's <a href="http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Oil-spills-Nigerians-seek-1bn-from-Shell-20111021">actions were willfully negligent</a> [AFP report] in contaminating groundwater. The plaintiffs filed suit on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> (ATS) [text] grounds and are asking for $1 billion in damages, an injunction and immediate cleanup.

<p>The US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] granted <em>certiorari</em> in two cases last week to determine whether political organizations and oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, are <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">immune from US lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] under the ATS. The plaintiffs in both cases allege human rights violations against an entity other than an individual person and the circuit courts have reached conflicting decisions with respect to interpretations of the ATS. The Supreme Court's decision will likely have an impact on the outcome of the Nigerian villagers' lawsuit. This case in not the first time Shell has faced legal action in Nigeria, however. A <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2009/06/royal-dutch-shell-reaches-settlement.php">$15.5 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] was reached in June 2009 between Royal Dutch Shell and the families of nine Nigerian activists who were killed in 1995. In 2006, a Nigerian court ordered Shell to <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/nigerian-court-orders-shell-oil-to-pay.php">pay</a> [JURIST report] $1.5 billion for its role in environmental damages that took place within the country. In January, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/second-circuit-revives-nigeria-lawsuits.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a district court opinion, reviving two lawsuits brought by Nigerian families against Pfizer under the ATS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics who were jailed for providing treatment to injured protesters all worked at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website] in Manama, which was stormed by security forces in March after they drove protesters out of the nearby Pearl Square&#8212;the focal point of protests inspired by uprisings that have swept the Arab world. Among other terrorism charges, the 20 were accused of having possession of an AK-47, Molotov cocktails and other weapons for the purposes of ousting the ruling regime, confiscating medical equipment, spreading lies, inciting hatred against the regime and violating various other laws and regulations with an aim to disturb public security. Earlier this month, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain">Bahrain</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-grants-retrials-to-20-convicted-medics.php">granted retrials</a> for the medics who were convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] by the National Safety Court of Appeal to terms ranging from five to ten years imprisonment. Human rights groups are <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/201110235173013184.html">concerned that the trials will proceed as appeals</a> [Al Jazeera report], though they have been reassured by Bahraini foreign minister Khalid Al-Khalifa that the evidence and testimony against the medics would be examined <em>de novo</em>.

<p>Shortly after the convictions were handed down, the medics <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">urged the UN to investigate claims of abuse</a> [JURIST report] and due process violations. Bahraini <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced in August that he will <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts were instituted in mid-March under Khalifa's <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by Human Rights Watch (HRW). The court <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court handed <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">the death sentence to four protesters</a>, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men who were accused of murdering police officers. All of the charges levied in the National Safety Court have been disputed by Bahraini citizens and international rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An autopsy confirmed that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2097580,00.html">died from a gun shot wound to the head</a> [AP report], but Abdul-Jalil suggested Monday that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyas-leader-orders-investigation-of-gadhafis-death-under-international-pressure/2011/10/24/gIQAdKAFCM_story.html">may have been killed by his own supporters</a> [AP report] to prevent him from implicating them in any crimes under his regime.

<p>Libyan transitional leader <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=8&ParentID=3&LangID=1">Mahmoud Jibril</a> [official profile] on Sunday declared the country's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">official liberation</a> [JURIST report] from Gaddafi's regime and set a schedule for establishing a new government.

The annual report "addresses the need to consider and integrate a gender perspective in the criminal justice system as a fundamental step towards allowing equal access to justice for women and men and in respect of the role to be played by judges and lawyers." During the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40154&Cr=women&Cr1=">presentation of her report</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website], Knaul stated that "[g]iven the historical and pervasive discrimination against women throughout the world, we have to look at how women are represented and treated in the criminal justice system." Knaul stressed the necessity of integrating gender perspective into judicial procedures to allow women's perspectives to challenge the "traditional notions of judging and judicial authority." The report includes a number of recommendations to states on how to improve gender equality in their criminal justice systems including identifying judicial regions most affected by gender-based discrimination, encouraging women to apply for high level criminal justice positions, and providing training geared on gender equality and women's rights. 

<p>Equality and women's rights continue to be an issue for much of the world. Earlier this month, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/SRWomenIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile] appeared in front of the General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-expert-urges-states-to-prevent-violence-against-women.php">urge states to fulfill their obligations to prevent violence against women</a> [JURIST report]. Manjoo's presentation followed her August request for the US government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-condemns-us-domestic-violence-laws.php">reevaluate its domestic violence policies</a> [JURIST report]. Manjoo also released a report in June that said there is a continued prevalence of <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">violence and discriminatory treatment of women in the US</a> [JURIST report], with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. In March, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Tunisia and Egypt to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection and to include women in the dialogue to shape the future of their countries. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women's-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">Afghan government to protect the rights of women</a> [JURIST report] during integration and reconciliation efforts conducted with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and other militants.

Chea's lawyers accused the prime minister of criminally conspiring to <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idINIndia-60088720111024">block some of the defense witnesses from testifying</a> [Reuters report] and consequently interfering with Chea's right to a fair trial. Chea, along with three other defendants, will <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-begin-khmer-rouge-trial-in-november.php">go on trial next month</a> [JURIST report] on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture in the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website]. The seven-year old tribunal is expected to spend about $150 million by the end of the year and has only issued one sentence since its creation. Former Judge Siegried Blunk recently resigned because of <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">implications of a lack of impartiality</a> [JURIST report] made by the Cambodian foreign minister.

<p>Last week, UN Under-Secretary General for Legal Affairs Patricia O'Brien urged the Cambodian government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-legal-chief-urges-cambodia-government-not-to-interfere-with-khmer-rouge-tribunal.php">refrain from interfering</a> [JURIST report] with the ECCC's work. In a meeting with Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister Sok An to discuss recent developments at the tribunal, O'Brien expressed concern and reiterated the call to respect the integrity and independence of the tribunal. Last month, the ECCC ordered the trials of four alleged Khmer Rouge leaders be split into a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report] to allow the tribunal to deliberate more quickly in the case.

The four leaders include Chea, who was Pol Pot's second-in-command and the group's chief ideologist, former head of state <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20-%20Khieu%20Samphan%20%5BEN%5D%20FINAL%2025%20May%202011.pdf">Khieu Samphan</a>, ex-foreign minister <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20-%20Ieng%20Sary%20%5BEN%5D%20Revised%2025%20May.pdf">Ieng Sary</a>, and his wife, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20Ieng%20Thirith%20%5BEN%5D%20FINAL%209%20June%202011.pdf">Leng Thirith</a> [case profiles, PDF], who served as minister for social affairs.

Upon learning of Cassesse's death, UN Secretary-General <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5628">praised</a> [press release] Cassese's contributions to the international legal community:<blockquote>Throughout his distinguished career Antonio Cassese made his exceptional professional skills available to the United Nations. ... In these and many other functions Antonio Cassese shaped the development of international criminal justice and made a major contribution to fighting impunity and bringing about an age of accountability. ... The United Nations will fondly remember Antonio Cassese as a giant of international law, as a loyal friend who was always there when the Organization needed his wise counsel and dedicated services, and mostly as an exceptionally charming and warm human being who courageously stood up for justice, for human rights and for humanity.</blockquote>The STL described Cassese as a <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/media/press-releases/22-10-2011-judge-antonio-cassese-dies">pioneer of modern international criminal law</a>, while the ICTY portrayed the human rights activist as a <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10830">visionary and passionate leader</a> [press releases]. Cassese passed away after a long battle with cancer.

<p>Cassese has been involved in international criminal proceedings as recently as August. Cassese, as president of the STL, had a large role in the trials of four men wanted for killing former prime minister <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">news archive</a>] in 2005. He made a <a href="https://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/292">public plea</a> [press release] in August, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">calling for the men to turn themselves in</a> [JURIST report]. He also guaranteed a fair trial and adequate representation and pressed Lebanese citizens to allow the STL to hold the assassins accountable. In December 2010, Cassese <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/lebanon-tribunal-rejects-motions-to-disqualify-judges-for-bias.php">rejected motions</a> [JURIST report] to disqualify Lebanese judges for bias, holding that Lebanese General Jamil El-Sayed had failed to provide enough evidence that the judges were biased such that the mixed-composition panel would be dissolved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW emergencies director Peter Bouckaert called on the NTC to immediately investigate and hold accountable those responsible for the killings. Witness reports to the HRW indicate that anti-Gaddafi supporters had been in control of  the area in which the hotel was located since early October. Sirte residents, who were at the hotel when HRW arrived, said that they found the bodies two days prior. Bouckaert said, "[i]f the NTC fails to investigate this crime it will signal that those who fought against Gaddafi can do anything without fear of prosecution. ... This latest massacre seems part of a trend of killings, looting, and other abuses committed by armed anti-Gaddafi fighters who consider themselves above the law. ... It is imperative that the transitional authorities take action to rein in these groups." HRW noted that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to prosecute those responsible for war crimes committed in Libya after February 15 and can bring charges against those responsible for physically committing the crime, senior officials who give the orders and those in a position of authority who failed to stop the crimes or prosecute those responsible. 

<p>The call for the NTC to investigate the discovery of the bodies comes days after Gaddafi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">captured and killed</a> and the Libyan prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">declared the official liberation</a> [JURIST reports] from Gaddafi's regime. Gaddafi's death and Libya's liberation come as the <a href="/timelines/2011/06/libya.php">latest of milestones</a> [JURIST timeline] in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which began in February as a protest in opposition to the arrest of a prominent human rights activist. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-warns-libya-regime-against-covering-up-possible-war-crimes.php">warned Libya </a> [JURIST report] in May against covering up possible war crimes that have occurred during the conflict, and stated those involved in a cover-up will be held accountable.

Jegen Warran claims to have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-25/australian-seeks-war-crime-charges-against-sri-lanka-president/3598486?section=vic">witnessed intentional attacks</a> [ABC News report] by Sri Lankan military forces against civilian targets including a working hospital, killing patients and other civilians. The filing also alleges that the president ordered the unlawful detention of Tamil civilians. The case is now under review by Australian <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/www/ministers/mcclelland.nsf/Page/Home">Attorney General Robert McClelland</a> [official website], whose consent will be needed for the case to proceed. The filing comes as Rajapaksa is scheduled to arrive in Australia this week to participate in the <a href="http://www.chogm2011.org/home">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> (CHOGM) [official website], a biannual meeting of the prime ministers and presidents of its member countries. The meeting will take place in Perth, Australia, where leaders are set to discuss both local and global issues and to develop related policies and initiatives.  

<p>This filing follows closely behind a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-urged-to-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes.php">call last week</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.icj-aust.org.au/">International Commission of Jurists, Australian Section</a> (ICJA) [advocacy website] for Australia to investigate a top ranking official in the <a href="http://www.slhcaust.org/">Sri Lankan High Commission</a> [official website] in Canberra for war crimes violations allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan Navy during clashes with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] in 2009. Last month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] accusing Sri Lankan troops of killing tens of thousands of civilians during the civil war.

The election for the new constituent assembly was a success with a turnout rate of over 90 percent, according to the <a href="http://www.tunisie.gov.tn/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1683&Itemid=518">official results</a> [official website, in Arabic]. The elected constituent assembly, consisting of 217 members, will be responsible for drafting a new constitution, choosing an interim government and setting the dates for parliamentary and presidential elections. As Pillay stressed in her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11521&LangID=E">statement</a> [text] on Friday, the constituent assembly will face the difficult task of addressing the demands of freedom and human rights within the new constitution:<blockquote>The principles of rule of law, of accountability, of non-discrimination and gender equality, the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of religion and belief&#8212;these rights are also laid down in the Universal Declaration and the desire to see them realized was a driving force behind the Tunisian revolution. These rights, and all the others laid down in this visionary document, and subsequently enshrined in a wide range of international treaties, must permeate any legal or policy response to the challenges Tunisia is facing. A successful rights-based revolution must be followed by a new rights-based social, legal, political and economic order.</blockquote>Pillay further stated that the election is only the first step toward democracy and that the new legal framework has to ensure the "clear separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches."

<p>The <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/TNIndex.aspx">UN human rights office in Tunisia</a> [official website], which was first opened in July, is currently assisting and offering advice as Tunisia continues to transform into an independent and open democratic system. The constituent assembly is considered to be the first of its kind in any North African or Middle Eastern country affected by the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=129&Body=North+Africa&Body1=protest">Arab Spring reform movement</a> [UN News Centre backgrounder] after a 10-month preparation.

There is both a political and religious divide between the countries, as Saudi Arabia is predominately Sunni and Iran is predominately Shia. The recent Arab Spring has only <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/21/iran-vs-saudi-arabia/">exacerbated tensions between the countries</a> [CNN backgrounder] as Iran, at least initially, supported the revolutions because it saw Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain as American allies.

Judge Mary Scriven said that the law might violate applicants' <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] protection against unreasonable search and seizures. She concluded:<blockquote>[I]mposing an injunction would serve the public interest by protecting [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] TANF applicants from the harm caused by infringement of their constitutional right, a right here that once infringed cannot be restored. "Perhaps no greater public interest exists than protecting a citizen's rights under the constitution." Accordingly, the Court concludes that preliminarily enjoining what appears likely to be deemed to be an unconstitutional intrusion on the Fourth Amendment rights of TANF applicants serves the public interest and outweighs whatever minimal harm a preliminary injunction might visit upon the State.</blockquote>A spokesperson for the state of Florida said that there will be an appeal of the ruling. More than 7,000 welfare applicants have passed the test since it began in July, with 32 people failing it. About 1,600 people have refused to take the test. Some policy experts <a href="/hotline/2011/10/elizabeth-lower-basch-drug-testing.php">argue</a> [JURIST comment] that the drug testing policy is harmful for needy families.

<p>The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> and the <a href="http://www.floridajusticeinstitute.org/">Florida Justice Institute</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-for-state-welfare-applicants.php">filed the challenge</a> [JURIST report] in September. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Luis Lebron, a 35-year-old Orlando resident, Navy veteran and full-time University of Central Florida student who applied for Temporary Cash Assistance to help support his four-year-old son. Lebron meets all the criteria for aid but refused to submit to the drug test on the principle that it is an infringement of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. The complaint notes that the US Supreme Court has held that suspicionless drug testing by the government is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment, the only exceptions being for substantial public safety concerns and students in the public school system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The request was due in part to the recent <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/news/969-as-world-piracy-hits-a-new-high-more-ships-are-escaping-somali-pirates-says-imb-r">conclusion</a> [IMB report] by the Malaysia-based <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre">International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center</a> [official website] that despite increased patrol, Somali pirates are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/un-security-council-calls-on-all-countries-to-make-piracy-a-crime/2011/10/24/gIQA0fzfCM_story.html">intensifying their attacks</a> [AP report]. With Somali pirates responsible for 56 percent of the 352 attacks reported this year, the Security Council hopes to increase the number of courts and prisons in Somalia and other regional States in order to increase jurisdiction and accelerate enforcement efforts. The resolution also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40177&Cr=somalia&Cr1=">urges a collaborative effort among states</a> [UN News Centre report] to share evidence and information regarding piracy suspects to further an anti-piracy international community:<blockquote>[The Security Council] [c]alls upon states ... to cooperate in determining jurisdiction, and in the investigation and prosecution of all persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, including anyone who incites or facilitates an act of piracy, consistent with applicable international law including human rights law; ... and [to] adopt a complete set of counter-piracy laws, including laws to prosecute those who illicitly finance, plan, organize, facilitate or profit from pirate attacks, with a view to ensuring the effective prosecution of suspected pirates and those associated with piracy attacks in Somalia, the post-conviction transfer of pirates prosecuted elsewhere to Somalia, and the imprisonment of convicted pirates in Somalia, as soon as possible.</blockquote>The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE73A6VM20110411">global economy has felt a billion dollar impact</a> [Reuters report] as a result of at least 29 vessels being hijacked and requesting multi-million-dollar ransoms. The resolution also asks UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to issue a progress report in two months regarding the prosecution of piracy suspects in Somalia.  

<p>International <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] reached an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all-time high</a> [JURIST report] early in the first quarter of 2011, according to a <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/news/441-attacks-off-the-somali-coast-drive-piracy-to-record-high-reports-imb">report</a> [press release] released in April by the IMB. Earlier that month, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-security-council-to-consider-special-maritime-piracy-courts.php">unanimously approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to consider creating new laws, courts and prisons specialized to address the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. Last January, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">IMB reported</a> [JURIST report] that, to that point, 2009 marked the worst year of piracy since 2003, spiking near Somalian waters then as well. In July 2009, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/maritime-piracy-has-doubled-in-first.php">IMB reported</a> [JURIST report] that pirate attacks around the globe doubled in the first half of 2009. Few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum would have put forward <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmbackben/ucbbc15658/ucbbc01.htm">three options</a> [press release] to the public for a vote: to remain in the EU, to leave the EU or to re-negotiate membership terms. Motion for debate on the topic was requested by member of parliament <a href = "http://davidnuttall.info/">David Nuttall</a> [official blog], who earlier this month <a href="http://davidnuttall.info/2011/10/01/time-we-all-had-a-say/">explained why he thought the public should have a chance to decide</a> [press release], noting much has changed since the last referendum on the issue:<blockquote>Back in 1975 there was a referendum on whether or not we stayed in what was then referred to as 'The Common Market' the European Economic Community. Since then the nature of the organisation which the British people voted to remain part of has changed beyond all recognition. Firstly, the word 'Economic' was dropped and we became members of the European Community. Then, we became members of the European Union. All without any consultation of the British people. It is now time we all had our say!</blockquote>Conservatives, led by Nuttall, went against the policies of conservative <a href = "http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] in voting for the referendum. Multiple petitions from outside organizations, which collectively gained more than 100,000 signatures, also contributed to the committee's decision to consider a referendum. Citizens who wish to leave the EU have expressed several reasons, including <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14939797">lack of transparency</a> in decision-making, concerns about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13856580">economic state</a> of other members and desire to keep the UK's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15144349">sovereignty</a> [BBC reports].

<p>Recently, the UK government and the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]&#8212;a court to which all EU members subscribe&#8212;have faced increasing conflict. Last week, the UK's top judge, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/judges-magistrates-and-tribunal-judges/biographies/biography-lcj">Lord Igor Judge</a> [official profile] said that the UK is <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/uk-top-judge-national-courts-not-bound-by-europe-rights-court.php">not bound by the rulings of the ECHR</a> [JURIST report]. In March, the UK <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/index.htm">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] announced the creation of a commission, suggested by Cameron, which will consider the <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease180311a.htm">implementation of a British Bill of Rights</a> [statement, text]. Former UK Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf has warned that a Bill of Rights would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-judge-warns-proposed-bill-of-rights-could-further-conflict-between-uk-echr.php">conflict</a> [JURIST report] with the European Convention on Human Rights, which the UK has incorporated into its law. While the government has not stated an intention to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, Woolf warned that continued adherence to the convention combined with the creation of Bill of Rights would create complications for judges in determining which to follow and further the existing conflict between the UK and the ECHR. Cameron suggested the creation of the commission in February after the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-parliament-rejects-prisoner-voting-rights-despite-echr-ruling.php">voted to reject</a> an ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/british-prisoners-may-be-given-right.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] and continue preventing prisoners from voting in British elections. The following month, the UK government took legal action to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/uk-to-appeal-echr-ruling-on-prisoner-voting-rights.php">overturn</a> [JURIST report] the ECHR ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under China's current criminal law, those who organize, lead or actively participate in terrorist activities can receive a punishment of up to 10 years in prison, but the law fails to define the terms "terrorist" and "terrorist organization," or to define what constitutes "terrorist acts." Chinese Vice Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-10/24/c_131210079.htm">emphasized the danger of having no clear definitions</a> [Xinhua report] in the current law, noting in his report to the NPC that "China is faced with the real threat of terrorist activities, and the struggle with terrorism is long-term, complicated and acute." The proposed legislation would define terrorists as "those who organize, plot and conduct terrorist acts as well as those who are members of terrorist groups," and terrorist acts as "those acts which are intended to induce public fear or to coerce state organs or international organizations by means of violence, sabotage, threats or other tactics." The bill would also allow for the assets of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations to be frozen and for the names of individuals and organizations to be published. 

<p>Other countries have also recently considered amending their anti-terrorism laws. In August, <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/default.aspx">Philippine President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website] urged lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/philippines-president-urges-lawmakers-to-strengthen-anti-terrorism-law.php">enhance a controversial anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] by removing provisions that deter authorities from using the law. The proposed change would reduce the $11,700-per-day fine imposed on police or military forces who wrongfully detain terror suspects, as well as removal of a provision requiring suspects to be alerted when they are placed under surveillance. The current law faces criticism from opponents who say its language is overly broad and that is has rarely been used. Also in August, Saudi Arabian officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/saudi-arabia-amends-highly-criticized-anti-terrorism-law.php">proposed amendments</a> [JURIST report] to a draft anti-terrorism law that would criminalize taking up arms against the king or crown prince. The Saudi Arabian draft law has been sharply criticized by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] which alleges the proposed law conflicts with international human rights treatises. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Though Abdul-Jalil says he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyas-new-leaders-say-they-will-make-islamic-sharia-law-main-source-of-legislation/2011/10/24/gIQAyE6PDM_story.html">intends to legalize polygamy</a> [AP report], which was previously outlawed by former leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], he does not intend to adopt the harsher punishments instituted by Iran and Saudi Arabia, such as cutting off limbs for thievery, beheading murderers, stoning adulterers and publicly flogging alcohol users. Critics fear that even the moderate implementation of Sharia law may <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2052398/Gaddafi-dead-Mahmoud-Jibril-says-legislation-based-Islamic-Sharia-law.html">stunt progressive legislation for women and families</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] and that insisting on the implementation of any Sharia law without allowing a vote on the issue flies in the face of Libya's long, violent struggle for democracy. Others celebrate the once-banned moderate Islamic party's presence in the upcoming free election.   

<p>This announcement follows closely on the heels of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] urging Libya's <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/24/libya-apparent-execution-53-gaddafi-supporters">investigate the apparent "mass execution"</a> [press release] of 53 Gaddafi supporters <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hrw-urges-libya-to-investigate-bodies-found-in-sirte.php">whose bodies were discovered</a> [JURIST report] at an abandoned hotel in an area of Sirte that was under anti-Gaddafi control. The call for the NTC to investigate the discovery of the bodies comes days after Gaddafi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">captured and killed</a> and the Libyan prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">declared the official liberation</a> [JURIST reports] from Gaddafi's regime. Gaddafi's death and Libya's liberation come as the <a href="/timelines/2011/06/libya.php">latest of milestones</a> [JURIST timeline] in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which began in February as a protest in opposition to the arrest of a prominent human rights activist.

The report alleges that since the anti-government protests began, Syrian government officials have violated international human rights laws by intercepting ambulances, raiding hospitals and abusing hospital patients believed to be associated with the protests. Hospitals are required to report patients suspected of involvement in the protests to the authorities, and doctors who treat these patients have allegedly been subject to detention and torture. Additionally, AI alleges that doctors and nurses on the staff in some hospitals have participated in abuse and denial of care to suspected protesters. The report found that many Syrians are not comfortable seeking care at state hospitals, and have sought out alternative medical care:<blockquote>Although prohibited by international human rights law and a serious breach of medical ethics, healthcare personnel have denied treatment to wounded patients on the basis of their real or presumed political affiliations. As well, security crackdowns and violent confrontations in the vicinity of healthcare facilities, and the occupation of facilities by armed forces and security personnel have prevented access to them by the wounded. People wounded in the unrest have become fearful of using state-run hospitals in case this leads to their being seen as government opponents and targeted for reprisals.</blockquote>AI has called on the Syrian government to require equal treatment of patients in state hospitals, call off abusive behavior by hospital employees and government officials, and immediately cease the unlawful detention of Syrian doctors. The Syrian government did not immediately respond to the report. 

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11493&LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] the international community to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-international-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">protect civilian lives in Syria</a> [JURIST report], where more than 3,000 civilians have been killed since protests against the government began. This statement followed a report from a UN commission <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2011/09/syria-urged-to-allow-human-rights-experts-to-visit-the-country/">urging</a> [statement] Syrian authorities to allow human rights experts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/syria-urged-to-allow-un-investigation-of-rights-violations.php">conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of human rights violations. In August, Pillay called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">violent suppression of anti-government protests</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay's remarks came after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published its 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in April but was not permitted to enter the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] on torture allegations. Lawyers from both CCIJ and the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] responded with disappointment to the blocked lawsuit and order that the proceedings be stayed. Matt Eisenbrandt, legal director of the CCIJ, said, "[t]he legal basis for the case is exceptionally strong under the Criminal Code of Canada, and this private prosecution was initiated because the government of Canada refused to prosecute." The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Private%20Prosecution_Oct_18_2011.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-rights-group-files-torture-complaint-against-bush.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in Surrey Provincial Court on behalf of three former Guantanamo detainees and one man still being held in Guantanamo, who has been there for more than nine years. CCIJ filed the complaint prior to Bush's visit to Surrey for a speaking engagement with former US president Bill Clinton. Various human rights groups have called for an investigation of Bush's role in allegedly sanctioning torture of detainees. 

<p>Last week, Bush was in Surrey to attend the <a href="http://www.surrey.ca/summit">Surrey Regional Economic Summit</a> [official website]. According to the CCIJ, the four men, three of whom have since been released without any formal charges ever being brought against them, endured "horrific and illegal" treatment while being detained at military bases in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. CCIJ alleges that Bush violated the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text]. The CCIJ and CCR <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-groups-file-canadian-indictment-against-bush-for-torture.php">initially filed an indictment against Bush</a> [JURIST report] in September accusing Bush of sanctioning enforced disappearances, secret detention and a variety of acts of torture. Earlier in October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] urged the Canadian government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-urge-canada-to-arrest-ex-us-president-bush-ahead-of-visit.php">investigate and arrest</a> [JURIST report] Bush for his role in torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new legislation, taking effect January 1, 2012, will eventually require all airlines, including those of non-EU countries, to pay for their carbon dioxide emissions in an effort to encourage airlines to use cleaner fuels and to economize fuel use. Those who do not comply would face steep fines. On Monday, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://transportation.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1428">voted to shield</a> [press release] US passenger and cargo planes from compliance with the EU law. The House <a href="http://transportation.house.gov/singlepages.aspx/803">Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica</a> [official profile] has criticized the law, calling it "an arbitrary and unjust violation of international law that disadvantages US air carriers, threatens US aviation jobs, and could close down direct travel from many central and western US airports to Europe" and a violation of international law and trade agreements. The change in the emissions law would greatly impact large US carriers, costing them an estimated $3 billion by 2020. Despite US opposition, EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/hedegaard/about/bio_en.htm">Climate Action Commissioner Connie Hedegaard</a> [official profile] said via Twitter that she <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=CHedegaardEU">expects the US to comply</a> [Twitter] with the law as the EU has respectfully complied with US law. 

<p>Several US and Canadian airlines have challenged the legislation in the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">EU Court of Justice</a> [official website] alleging that the carbon emission fees violate international law.

McClelland's announcement was in response to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-citizen-files-war-crimes-charges-against-sri-lanka-president.php">charges filed</a> [JURIST report] by an Australian citizen claiming that during the 2009 Sri Lankan civil war, civilian targets were intentionally bombed by military forces. McClelland's consent is needed for such charges to proceed, but a statement issued from his office explained that pursuing such charges would be in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-25/mcclelland-sri-lanka-decision/3600104">breach of international laws</a> [ABC News report], which provide immunity for heads of state. Specifically, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fsia1985288/">Foreign States Immunity Act 1985</a> [text] extends immunities to heads of state when visiting on diplomatic missions. The filed charges stem from Rajapaksa's upcoming visit to Perth, Australia, to participate in the <a href="http://www.chogm2011.org/home">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> (CHOGM) [official website] where prime ministers and presidents of member countries are set to discuss both local and global issues. 

<p>The charges follow closely behind a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-urged-to-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes.php">call last week</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.icj-aust.org.au/">International Commission of Jurists, Australian Section</a> (ICJA) [advocacy website] for Australia to investigate a top ranking official in the <a href="http://www.slhcaust.org/">Sri Lankan High Commission</a> [official website] in Canberra for war crimes violations allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan Navy during clashes with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LITE) [JURIST news archive] in 2009.  Last month, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] accusing Sri Lankan troops of killing tens of thousands of civilians during the civil war. In April, a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka found <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the  <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive], warranting further investigation. In December, the <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">UN panel would be allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes. The decision signaled a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">reversal after months of strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government, which described the UN panel as an infringment of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. </p>]]></content:encoded>

UN Special Rapporteur Margaret Sekaggya presented her fourth <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&DS=a/66/203&Lang=E">report</a> [text, PDF] on the right to defend human rights, which is aimed to increase understanding of the 1998 UN Declaration addressing the dangers that human rights defenders face. Sekaggya stressed that implementing the declaration, which sets out the rights and responsibilities crucial to the promotion and protection of human rights, is essential to allowing human rights defenders to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40178&Cr=human+rights+defenders&Cr1=">carry out their work</a> [UN News Centre report]. The report states:<blockquote>although some progress has been made, many countries continue to pass laws and regulations that restrict the space for human rights activities and that are incompatible with international standards and with the Declaration in particular. Even where efforts are made to adopt laws that are in line with international standards, their ineffective implementation often remains a problem.</blockquote>The aim of this report is both to make states aware of the rights provided for in the declaration and to ensure respect for the rights to which rights defenders are entitled.  

<p>Protection of human rights remains a central concern for the UN, with rights activists across the globe being subject to violence and arrest. In August, Chinese authorities in Beijing <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/china-begins-trial-against-human-rights-activist.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of Wang Lihong, one of the dozens of human rights activists the government detained earlier this year as part of a crackdown on dissidents in the country. Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>] remains imprisoned in China despite international calls for his release. In July a coalition of human rights organizations issued a joint statement <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-urge-russia-probe-of-activist-estemirova-murder.php">urging the Russian government to investigate the murder</a> [JURIST report] of rights activist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8152648.stm">Natalia Estemirova</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Estemirova">news archive</a>]. Estemirova, who was kidnapped in Grozny in July 2009 and shot to death, reported regularly on human rights abuses committed by the Chechen government, including extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances. In June, Zimbabwean human rights activist Farai Maguwu was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/zimbabwe-rights-activist-arrest-over-conflict-diamond-information.php">arrested</a> for allegedly supplying false information about Zimbabwe's controversial diamond mining practices to the international diamond control body the <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/">Kimberley Process</a> (KP) [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontegypt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table> [JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] warned on Tuesday that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/25/egypt-don-t-cover-military-killing-copt-protesters">may attempt to cover up</a> [press release] various aspects of the killing of more than two dozen mostly Coptic Christian demonstrators on October 9. The protests, which began in Maspero when approximately 1,000 Christians attempted a sit-in outside of the state television building, quickly turned violent with the arrival of the Egyptian military, and ultimately resulted in the deaths of 27 people, including 21 Christians. In defense of its generals, Egypt's ruling military council has asserted that the protesters began both the confrontation and the ensuing violence, which marks the single deadliest incident since the February overthrow of president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. Although the council has placed military prosecutors in charge of investigating the incident, HRW has urged Egyptian officials to transfer the investigation to civilian prosecutors. Deputy Middle East and North Africa director Joe Stork argues this is the only way to legitimize the Egyptian rule of law under the new democracy:<blockquote>The military cannot investigate itself with any credibility. This had been an essentially peaceful protest until the military used excessive force and military vehicles ran over protesters. The only hope for justice for the victims is an independent civilian-led investigation that the army fully cooperates with and cannot control and that leads to the prosecution of those responsible.</blockquote>As the demonstration moved toward the state television building, viewers were encouraged to aid the military in fending off the Christian protesters. Such encouragement from the state has led HRW to believe that an investigation into the Egypitan military's potential manipulation of the media is duly warranted. "The military has already has already tried to control the media narrative," added Stork, "and it should not be allowed to cover up what happened on October 9."

<p>The Maspero Massacre marks yet another controversial incident regarding protests in Egypt even after the removal of its former president. In March, Arab and Egyptian human rights groups accused then-president Mubarak and police of murdering protesters during demonstrations, therein prompting the military council to instruct its top prosecutor to investigate the killings. Although the military council attempted to curb future demonstrations with a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-temporary-government-releases-decree-criminalizing-strikes.php">proposed law imposing prison sentences</a> [JURIST report] and fines for those inciting protests, the legislation was widely <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/25/egypt-revoke-ban-strikes-demonstrations">condemned</a> [press release] by international rights groups, namely HRW, as a violation of international law. In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] accused Egypt's military council of <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Relying on detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." HRW echoed this sentiment at the time in claiming that the Egyptian military was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">improperly detaining protesters and allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report]. Despite a warning to the Egyptian government from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [UN profile], in January to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">respect the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report], Egypt has endured criticism for the handling of its protests throughout the year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the motion, released to the public on Monday, Reyes suggests that the Pentagon warn officers who serve as jurors from the start if a prisoner is to be held indefinitely:<blockquote>Each of the participants involved in this case, especially the Members of the Commission, need to know whether they are participating in a trial with real consequences of "merely a trial in name" where the political decision, already made and confirmed, will inform the result. If the latter, the Judge, the prosecutors, defense counsel and importantly the members may say, "I do not want to be a part of such a proceeding." And for some, their oaths may include participation in such a trial.</blockquote>Al-Nashiri, scheduled to be arraigned on November 9 at Guantanamo, is being <a href="http://www.mc.mil/CASES/MilitaryCommissions.aspx">charged</a> [materials] with murder, terrorism and conspiracy and faces the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have not yet responded to Reyes' motion.

<p>Al-Nashiri, the alleged plotter of the USS Cole bombing, has been at the center of controversy for many years. In May, lawyers for al-Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">filed suit against Poland</a> [JURIST report] over his supposed torture in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in the country. In 2007, al-Nashiri declared that his confession to orchestrating the USS Cole bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-says-torture.php">elicited under torture</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Nashiri, along with fellow militant <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/jamel-ahmed-mohammed-ali-al-badawi">Jamal al-Badawi</a> [FBI backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/yemeni-court-upholds-death-sentence-in.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] by a Yemeni court in 2004 for his role in the attack on the Cole. At least 17 sailors were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15101631">killed</a> [BBC report] and 40 were wounded in the USS Cole bombing in Aden, Yemen, on October 12, 2000. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The memorandum allegedly contains the <a href = "http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ny-judge-orders-release-immigrant-program-memo-14810296">reasoning behind forcing the program to be mandatory</a> [AP report] for all states rather than opt-in. That decision, in October 2010, was spurred by more than 500 rights groups <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/rights-groups-urge-obama-to-halt-use-of-local-authorities-in-immigration-enforcement.php">calling on President Barack Obama to dismantle the program</a> [JURIST report] and several states ending their involvement in Secure Communities. Last week, the <a href = "http://www.law.berkeley.edu/ewi.htm">Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy</a> [academic website] released a <a href = "http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Secure_Communities_by_the_Numbers.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] proclaiming that Secure Communities has often caught legal citizens in its net, that Latinos are disproportionately targeted and that non-violent offenders are often pursued despite the stated goals of the program. The US <a href = "http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) and <a href = "http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official websites] also announced last week that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/us-deported-400000-illegal-immigrants-in-2011-dhs.php">396,906 illegal immigrants were deported in 2011</a> [JURIST report], the largest number in the agencies' history. The report indicated that more than half of the deportees were convicted criminals. The government must release the Secured Communities memorandum by November 1.

<p>The Secure Communities Program, as well as other aspects of the US immigration detention policy, have been heavily criticized by constitutional and immigration rights groups. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/files/committees/editorial_0331.shtm">Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council</a> (HSAC) [official website] approved a report responding to concerns with the program. The report stated that there was strong agreement among the committee members that ICE should continue taking enforcement action against serious criminal offenders who are subject to deportation, but that ICE enforcement policy surrounding removal of minor offenders or those who have never been convicted of a crime continues causing confusion. In June, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] and a coalition of other rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-groups-reject-ice-changes-immigration-enforcement-program.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the changes announced by ICE to the program. The groups claimed Secure Communities undermines public safety, invites racial profiling and pulls non-citizens into what they call a "dangerous" system of detention and deportation. In March, the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that US immigration enforcement agencies are overly reliant on a flawed detention system. The IACHR investigated six immigrant detention centers based throughout Arizona and Texas. The report expressed concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by ICE. It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. IACHR also found the average 30 day detentions troubling, arguing that it is likely to increase as backlogs of immigration cases increase. The report also criticized the lack of a genuine civil detention system and use of disproportionately restrictive penal and punitive measures during the detention period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Allowing the suit under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text], the court ruled that it may proceed due to the Australian mining company's substantial operations in the US. Rejecting several attempts by the company to block the suit, it also ruled that a corporation can be held liable for genocide:<blockquote>Corporations are recognized legal entities, yet, according to the [International Court of Justice], even amorphous "groups" may be guilty of genocide. The ICJ's analysis is instructive, in particular because the Supreme Court has noted that "[i]n interpreting our treaty obligations, we ... consider the views of the ICJ itself, 'giving respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret the treaty.'" The ICJ concluded that genocide is a violation of international law whether committed by an individual, an amorphous group, or a state, consistent with all other sources of international law recognizing the universality of the prohibition of genocide.</blockquote>The initial complaint alleges that Rio Tinto, while controlling the government of Papua New Guinea, sought to eliminate the residents of the primary island, Bougainville, after they took arms against the company in response to years of environmental and human rights abuses on the island. Due to Rio Tinto and the government treating the Bougainvilleans as a class, the court ruled that this was enough to constitute a protected class for the purposes of genocide. The complaint also alleged charges of institutionalized racism: "Rio Tinto oversaw this mass infliction of death and suffering as a part of its pattern of behavior on account of its worldwide view that members of non-white races were 'expendable.'" The ruling also states that both the governments of Papua New Guinea and the US fully support the suit. Rio Tinto <a href = "http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/10/25/rio-tinto-to-defend-itself-after-us-court-reinstates-genocide-claims/">will defend</a> [Dow Jones report] against the charges when the suit goes to court. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] will <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">hear oral arguments this term</a> [JURIST report] in <span class = "casename">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</span> to determine whether three oil companies are immune from US lawsuits under the Alien Tort Statute for torture and international law violations that took place overseas.

<p>Rio Tinto operated a mine in Panguna, in Bougainville, since 1975, which provided 20 percent of the Papua New Guinea government's wealth. However, Bougainvillean people contend that not only did their citizenry not benefit significantly from these profits, but that Rio Tinto engaged in a number of environmental and human rights abuses. This reportedly included segregating white and local workers, polluting the Jaba River to the point where birth defects became prevalent and causing the extinction of an island animal. In response, the <a href = "http://panguna-landowners.org/bcllandowners/">United Panguna Landowners Association</a> [advocacy website] was formed, which eventually led to the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, who revolted against the Panguna mine in 1988. This incident evolved into the <a href ="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/bougainville.htm">Bougainville Revolution</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], Papua New Guinea's nine-year civil war that took 20,000 lives. Although the war ended in 1997 with a peace accord, in 2001, a Papua New Guinea opposition leader <a href = "http://www.sbs.com.au/dateline/story/transcript/id/601246/n/Blood-and-Treasure">signed an affidavit </a> [SBS Dateline report transcript] claiming that Rio Tinto controlled the Papua New Guinea government during the war and provided substantial financial and military aid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] on Tuesday issued a <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/files/Preliminary%20Injunction%20-%2010-25-11.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. The judge <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/files/Ultrasound%20Opinion%20102511.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] challenge to certain provisions of the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">"Woman's Right to Know Act"</a> [HB 854 materials] which were set to become effective Wednesday. Specifically, the plaintiffs challenged the act's "speech and display requirements," which mandate that a physician perform an ultrasound at least four hours before an abortion and then display the images to the patient while providing an explanation of the display. The plaintiffs' challenge is based on the grounds that they compel "unwilling speakers to deliver the state's message discouraging abortion." They further argue that as a result of this alleged violation, the requirements warrant analysis under a strict scrutiny standard. The defendants contend that strict scrutiny is not the correct standard, but, even if it applies, the requirements should be upheld as they further three compelling state interests: "protecting the psychological health of the patient, preventing coercive abortions, and expressing its preference for the life of the unborn." Judge Catherine Eagles rejected the defendants' arguments regarding the application of a different standard: <blockquote>It is undisputed that the Act compels content-based speech by providers; it requires providers to orally and visually convey specified material about the fetus to their patients. The message is compelled regardless of a patient's individual circumstances or condition and regardless of the provider's medical opinion. The message is required even when the provider does not want to deliver the message and even when the patients affirmatively do not wish to see it or hear it. It is further undisputed that this implicates the First Amendment rights of providers such as the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>The judge also held that, even if compelling state interests exist, the defendants failed to produce evidence that "alternatives more in proportion to the resulting burdens placed on speech would not suffice." Because the provisions at issue are able to be severed, the rest of the act will take effect Wednesday, as originally scheduled.

<p>The plaintiffs sought an injunction after the state's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate</a> voted to override Governor Beverly Purdue's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the legislation. Another bill related to abortion passed by the North Carolina Legislature has also recently been challenged on First Amendment grounds. Last month, the <a href="http://acluofnc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-north-carolina-pro-life-license-plates.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a North Carolina state law authorizing the use of pro-life license plates as a violation of the First Amendment. In June, the North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/">General Assembly</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/billlookup/billlookup.pl?Session=2011&BillID=H289">bill</a> [HB 289 materials] authorizing the issuance of "Choose Life" license plates, but failed to authorize the use of license plates stating, "Trust Women. Respect Choice," or "Respect Choice," which would indicate advocacy of reproductive rights. The ACLU-NCLF alleges that allowing pro-life proponents to express their views through the use of license plates while denying the same right to pro-choice proponents is discriminatory and in violation of the First Amendment. Katherine Lewis Parker, the Legal Director of the ACLU-NCLF, indicated that the law is being challenged because of its <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/?q=aclu-nc-files-lawsuit-challenging-discriminatory-license-plate-scheme">inhibitions on freedom of speech</a> [statement] and not because of the abortion position advocated by the license plates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyer for the Gaddafi family, Marcel Ceccaldi, spoke to France-based radio station <a href="http://www.europe1.fr/International/Kadhafi-accuse-l-Otan-de-crime-de-guerre-626989/">Europe1</a> [Europe1 report, in French] and indicated that the complaint stems from information suggesting that NATO helicopters were firing at Gaddafi's convoy. Ceccaldi also accused NATO of firing on the convoy as part of its operation to eliminate the former Libyan leader and criticized the display of Gaddafi's body in Misrata. The family intends to file the complaint in the ICC, which has jurisdiction over war crimes that have occurred in Libya since February 15, 2011 after the UN Security counsel <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">unanimously voted</a> [JURIST report] to refer Libya to the court. The ICC has authority under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] to prosecute any person responsible directly or indirectly for the commission of war crimes. Ceccaldi did not indicate when the complaint would be filed, but did indicate it would target both NATO governing officials and the leaders of member states.

<p>Gaddafi's family is not alone in requesting that his killing be investigated as a possible war crime. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-office-calls-for-investigation-into-gaddafi-killing.php">called for a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death. Libya has also taken its own steps to investigate the death. Interim Libyan leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Monday that he has <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-leader-orders-investigation-into-gaddafi-death.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of the former leader. He said that the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transition Council</a> (NTC) [official website] has formed a committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's capture and death at the hands of opposition forces in his hometown of Sirte. Human rights groups including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and international governments have also called for an official investigation. In June, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the "de facto Prime Minister," and his brother-in-law <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Sanussi</a> [warrants, PDF], the head of intelligence, for alleged crimes against the people of Libya to quell the revolt that began in February. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi still remains <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/uk-libya-saif-idUKTRE79N3W320111024">at large</a> [Reuters report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.news24.com/World/News/Brazil-high-court-allows-gay-marriage-20111026">voted 4-1 in favor</a> [AFP report] of recognizing same-sex marriages. The ruling was necessary following a number of disparate rulings by lower courts on petitions from couples seeking to have their civil unions recognized as full marriages. The union at issue had been denied full marriage rights by two lower courts, but those decisions were reversed by the high court, which took a step in this direction beginning in May, when it <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/brazil-supreme-court-recognizes-same-sex-civil-unions.php">unanimously recognized rights</a> [JURIST report] for partners in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22civil%20union%22">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Through that ruling, gay couples in "stable relationships" were given the rights to community property, alimony, health insurance and tax benefits, adoption, and inheritance rights. While the state courts are not required to follow the decision rendered by the Supreme Court, it is hoped that the ruling will still work to discourage states within the country from blocking same-sex marriages.

<p>Foreign and domestic courts and legislatures are increasingly addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions and marriages. In August, Chilean <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidente/">President Sebastian Pinera</a> [official profile, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/chile-president-introduces-civil-union-legislation.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex civil unions. The bill would extend inheritance and social welfare rights to same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual couples. Pinera insisted that marriage is between a man and a women but acknowledged that other forms of relationships are effective and that the state is obligated to recognize, protect and respect those partnerships. In April, Hungary added a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its constitution. France <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">upheld a same-sex marriage ban</a> [JURIST report] in January. Same-sex marriage is recognized in jurisdictions in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mexico-city-legislature-approves-same.php">Mexico</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">US</a> and is recognized nationwide in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/portugal-president-ratifies-same-sex-marriage-law.php">Portugal</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Sweden</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/norway-parliament-approves-same-sex.php">Norway</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iceland-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Iceland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/south-africa-high-court-says-same-sex.php">South Africa</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/">National Chamber Litigation Center</a> (NCLC) [official website], the Chamber of Commerce's public policy law firm, wrote the brief, which does not address the PPACA's constitutionality, but outlines the negative consequences for businesses that will allegedly result from the law's implementation:<blockquote>The PPACA imposes a myriad of costly obligations on the business community. ... Uncertainty over the future of the PPACA seriously undermines the ability of American businesses to plan for the future, and to make informed decisions concerning investment in growth and hiring.</blockquote>The Chamber of Commerce argues that the uncertain constitutionality of the PPACA is hurting businesses' ability to make future financial decisions. The Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue next summer.

<p>There are currently several health care appeals pending before the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/virginia-appeals-health-care-dismissal-to-supreme-court.php">state of Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php">Liberty University appealed</a> a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed their challenges for lack of standing</a> [JURIST reports]. In September, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-appeal-to-supreme-court-on-health-care-law.php">appealed</a> an August ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down the individual mandate</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional, creating a circuit split. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law in June</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">that ruling was appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> [advocacy website].

The vote was supported by the <a href="http://www.frenteamplio.org.uy/">Broad Front coalition</a> (Frente Amplio) [party website, in Spanish], which is control of the <a href="http://www.diputados.gub.uy/">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in Spanish]. The House is scheduled to vote on this issue later Wednesday. Proponents of the law's revocation argue that the amnesty law violates the international human rights principles and treaties signed and ratified by Uruguay. In addition, they claim it is in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention of Human Rights and the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture.

<p>In June, Uruguayan <a href="http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/wps/wcm/connect/presidencia/portalpresidencia/presidente">President Jose Mujica</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/uruguay-president-to-allow-probe-into-military-junta-crimes.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that 80 administrative acts under the amnesty law preventing investigations of crimes committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship will be removed. This revocation only involved the executive branch's administrative acts, leaving it for the courts to decide how to proceed. In May, the House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/uruguay-fails-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">failed to partially repeal</a> the amnesty law in a vote of 49-49 due to criticism that the law will allow the prosecution of veterans of the war but not rebel guerrillas. A month earlier, the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/uruguay-senate-votes-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">voted to overturn</a> [JURIST reports] the law by a vote of 16-15. In March, the <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=666614&CFTOKEN=69520161">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/human-rights-court-invalidates-uruguay-military-amnesty-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Uruguay's government must bring to justice those responsible for the disappearance of a woman abducted by Uruguay government forces in 1976. In October of last year, the effort to overturn the law through a <a href="http://espectador.com/documentos/nulidad_caducidad.pdf">referendum</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] when only 48 percent voted in support of such change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges come in connection to his relationship with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive], co-founder of the Galleon Group, who was <a href="=/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced to 11 years</a> [JURIST report] in federal prison for insider trading earlier this month. The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website] unsealed the findings of its investigation which allege that Gupta disclosed material and nonpublic facts to Rajaratnam that he learned during board meetings. One of the allegations holds that Gupta informed Rajaratnam of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s investment into Goldman Sachs in September 2008. It also alleges that Gupta disclosed details of Goldman Sachs' financial situation in both the second and fourth quarter of 2008. Pree Bharara, the US Attorney in New York, asserts that Gupta <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/October11/guptarajatindictmentpr.pdf">failed to do his duty</a> [press release, PDF]:<blockquote>Rajat Gupta was entrusted by some of the premier institutions of American business to sit inside their boardrooms, among their executives and directors, and receive their confidential information so that he could give advice and counsel for the benefit of their shareholders. As alleged, he broke that trust and instead became the illegal eyes and ears in the boardroom for his friend and business associate, Raj Rajaratnam, who reaped enormous profits from Mr. Gupta's breach of duty.</blockquote>The government might have a difficult time proving its case since the most crucial evidence against Gupta came out in Rajaratnam's trial in the form of phone calls between Rajaratnam and his employees. Those phone calls might not be admissible in court if the judge deems them hearsay. 

<p>Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted of 14 counts of insider trading</a> [JURIST report] in May in the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Former hedge fund consultant Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> in September and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">originally pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 after being indicted for insider trading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICC has been <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/26/173899.html?PHPSESSID=j6gs29gc8dd8tilk058qommd42">unable to confirm</a> [Al Arabiya report] these reports. Earlier in the summer, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi for crimes against humanity. Saif al-Islam was reportedly injured during the activity that resulted in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">capture and death</a> [JURIST report] of his father last week outside of Sirte, but had later been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/us-libya-saif-escape-idUSTRE79N7E820111024">seen</a> [Reuters report] preparing to flee Libya with al-Senussi. This report comes as the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] appears to be drawing to a close after the interim Libyan prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] the country's liberation following Gaddafi's death.

<p>In June, ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] announced that his office was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">pursuing arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." He said Saif al-Islam was acting as Gaddafi's "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. Saif al-Islam received a PhD from the London School of Economics in 2008 and is fluent in English. He had been seen by some as a potential reformer and successor to his father. In February, he announced that the Libyan government was set to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">undertake constitutional reforms</a> [JURIST report] in response to protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/Elections/Prosecutor/">Search Committee for the position of the Prosecutor of the ICC</a> [official website] <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79O0J920111025">submitted</a> [Reuters report] its <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Elections/EP2011/EP2011-PSC-Report-complete-ENG.pdf">consensus report</a> [report with annexes, PDF] to the Bureau of the Assembly of State Parties (ASP) with the shortlist of four names after interviewing eight candidates from a list of 52 potentials. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Deputy+Prosecutor+_Prosecutions_.htm">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] of the Gambia, Deputy Prosecutor of the ICC since 2004, tops the list and has long been considered the favorite to succeed Moreno-Ocampo, as many of the ICC's cases currently focus on Africa. Additionally, Bensouda has the backing of the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website], the support of which has been critical to the ICC. The other African native on the list is Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, currently Chief Justice of the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/">Judiciary of Tanzania</a> [official website]. Also on the list are <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/ocp/cayley">Andrew Cayley</a> [official profile] of the UK, International Co-Prosecutor at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and Robert Petit of Canada, Counsel, <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/warcrimes-crimesdeguerre/home-accueil-eng.asp">Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes</a> [official website] Section of Canada's Department of Justice. The consensus report notes:<blockquote>In commending this shortlist, the Search Committee does not differentiate between the candidates in terms of suitability or make any preferential recommendation concerning any candidate. ... [T]he Search Committee considers its function to be that of a technical committee of the Bureau, to assist the Bureau and the ASP in their endeavours to secure the election of the Prosecutor by consensus [as required by ICC/ASP resolution]. In the light of the Search Committee's Report, it will properly be a matter for the Bureau and the ASP to consider how best to proceed to secure the formal nomination and election by consensus of the next Prosecutor.</blockquote>ICC member states must now try to reach an informal consensus on one candidate, who then must receive an absolute majority of the formal vote via secret ballot at an ASP meeting in December in New York. The new prosecutor will take office in July 2012.

<p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has called for full transparency in the selection process and notes that the Rome Statute which established the ICC <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/international-criminal-court-ensure-best-candidate-elected-new-prosecutor-2011-10-2">sets out clear criteria for electing a Prosecutor</a> [press release], who "must be of high moral character and have extensive practical experience in the prosecution or trial of criminal cases." A successful candidate must also "have a proven history of performing professional duties impartially and independently" and have other relevant experience such as a background in prosecuting crimes under international law and expertise in specific issues, such as violence against women and children. As Prosecutor, Argentinian Moreno-Ocampo has been widely praised for his promotion of the work of the ICC. During his tenure he has launched seven formal investigations, begun three trials and issued arrest warrants for Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir and other military leaders wanted for human rights violations. However he has also been criticized due to the ICC's slow progress in achieving results, particularly in failing to bring a larger number of senior government officials to trial for various atrocities. This month Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">visited the Ivory Coast</a> in response to allegations of war crimes committed during post-election violence in the country last November, and the prosecutor subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-singles-out-individuals-for-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">singled out individuals</a> [JURIST reports] for the ICC to investigate. In June Moreno-Ocampo made worldwide headlines by presenting to the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">sufficient evidence to procure arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for deposed Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and two of his high-ranking officials, including Gaddafi's son.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Padilla, represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], filed an action against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other government officials, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion], claiming that his detention as an enemy combatant was unlawful and that he was subjected to torture, denied communication with his family or lawyers, denied ability to practice his religion and denied appropriate medical care. Padilla's suit was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-padilla-torture-suit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in February by the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website], which ruled that defendants had qualified immunity because the law did not expressly prohibit the torture of an American citizen classified as an enemy combatant. The appeal claims that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-appeals-dismissal-of-padilla-unlawful-detention-suit.php">district court erred</a> [JURIST report] in finding special factors precluding a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> remedy and finding the defendants entitled to qualified immunity. ACLU National Security Project litigation director Ben Wizner <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-appeals-court-hold-officials-accountable-torture-jose-padilla">said</a> [press release] Wednesday:<blockquote>The defendants in this case seized Jose Padilla from a civilian jail and hid him away in a military brig precisely to keep the courts from interfering with the terrible things they were doing to him. By granting the defendants legal immunity for their cruel acts, the district court vindicated their deliberate efforts to circumvent the Constitution. ... If the law does not protect Jose Padilla&#8212;an American citizen arrested on American soil and tortured in an American prison&#8212;it protects no one.</blockquote>Padilla was was arrested in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and subsequently detained as an enemy combatant. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">convicted</a> on terrorism charges in 2007 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 17 years in prison.

<p>In the last several years there have been several suits brought against officials in the Bush administration. In August, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-rumsfeld-torture-suit-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a torture suit against Rumsfeld by two American citizens can proceed under the cause of action recognized in <span class="casename">Bivens</span>. Also in August, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-allows-US-intelligence-officers-suit-against-rumsfeld.php">Rumsfeld could be sued</a> [JURIST report] by a former US military contractor who claims he was tortured while imprisoned in Iraq. In early 2011, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a torture suit against Rumsfeld brought by Afghan and Iraqi citizens alleging they were illegally detained and tortured. Also this year, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-98.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that former US Attorney General John Ashcroft is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">immune from suit</a> [JURIST report] and was entitled to absolute immunity because he did not clearly violate any established law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesman for the Jakarta High Court confirmed without elaboration that the chief judge reduced the jail term to nine years. Regarded as a spiritual leader of militant Islam in Indonesia, 73-year-old cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=" abu+bakar+bashir""="">Abu Bakar Bashir</a> [JURIST news archive] is a vocal advocate of violent jihad and was jailed in June for backing a terrorist training camp in the Indonesian province of Aceh. The training camp prepared Islamic radicals to carry out attacks in Jakarta and was allegedly planning attacks modeled after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=" mumbai+attacks""="">2008 Mumbai terror attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and targeting high-profile members of the Indonesian government. Bashir was also accused of providing more than $62,000 to help fund the camp. The cleric was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/indonesia-cleric-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-on-terror-conviction.php">convicted of inciting terrorism</a> in connection with the terrorist training camp in May after having <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/indonesia-cleric-pleads-not-guilty-to-terror-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports] the month before. He was not convicted of funding terrorist activities because there was not enough evidence to prove Bashir's money contributed to purchasing guns for use at the training camp. Bashir's lawyers have appealed the case to the Indonesian Supreme Court and have stated they are confident Bashir will eventually be cleared of terrorism charges and released from prison altogether.

<p>Bashir's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/radical-indonesia-cleric-tried-for-terrorism.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] in the District Court of South Jakarta. He was suspected of links to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9126/alqaeda_aka_alqaida_alqaida.html">al Qaeda</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=" al+qaeda""="">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/jemaah.html">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder], a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda that has been implicated in a number of attacks in Indonesia, including the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=" bali+nightclub""="">2002 Bali nightclub bombing</a> [JURIST news archive] that left more than 200 people dead. In 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/indonesia-high-court-overturns.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Bashir's conviction on conspiracy charges connecting him with the bombings. He was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-distressed-over-release-of.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] earlier in 2006 after spending 26 months in jail on different charges related to the bombings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The current study on how to keep the invasive Asian carp from crossing between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi river is <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20111026/NEWS06/111026026/Schuette-again-files-Asian-carp-appeal-Supreme-Court?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE">expected to take five years</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report]. Some experts have indicated the invasive species could consume enough plankton to disrupt the food chain, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/states-asian-carp-case-supreme-court-14820157">damaging the multi-billion dollar fishing industry</a> [AP report].  Shuette <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-164-46849_47203-264659--,00.html">explained</a> [press release]: "We need to close the Asian carp superhighway, and do it now. Time is running out for the Great Lakes, and we can't afford to wait years before the federal government takes meaningful action." Shuette has also organized a national coalition of 17 attorneys general to advocate a Congressional legislative solution.

<p>The appeal comes after the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-block-invasive-fish-from-great-lakes.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] the five states efforts to stop Asian carp. The Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/26/asian-carp-supreme-court_n_551798.html">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [AP report] on the issue three times as of April 2010. In December 2009, the state of Michigan filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the Supreme Court against the state of Illinois seeking to close the two waterways, as the court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the states. All three times, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> without comment on the dispute. Michigan reopened the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/12-21-09_Carp_Fact_Sheet_305177_7.pdf">longstanding controversy</a> [backgrounder, PDF] over the diversion canal, created in the 1890s to keep Chicago's sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan. The court issued decrees over the canal in 1930, 1933, 1956, 1967 and 1980. The carp have been traveling up the Mississippi and Illinois rivers for years. Tests have showed that the carp may have gotten through an underwater electric barrier and may now be within six miles of Lake Michigan. The fish were originally imported to control algae in fisheries on the Mississippi River, but escaped during a 1990s flood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40209&Cr=sri+lanka&Cr1=">comments came during a meeting with Mahinda Samarasinghe</a> [UN News Centre report], the Special Envoy of the President of Sri Lanka on Human Rights, as part of the UN's <a href="http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/10/26/un-chief-stresses-importance-of-sri-lankas-reconciliation-process/">ongoing dialogue with the Colombo government</a> [VOA report]. The secretary-general also stressed "the importance of an inclusive national dialogue aimed at achieving genuine political reconciliation, as well as ongoing progress with regard to recovery and resettlement efforts in the north" where large numbers of internally displaced persons currently live.

<p>Earlier this week, Australian Attorney-General Robert McClelland <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-ag-refuses-to-allow-war-crimes-case.php">refused to allow a war crimes case</a> against Sri Lankan <a href="http://president.gov.lk/mahinda_rajapaksa.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] despite <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-citizen-files-war-crimes-charges-against-sri-lanka-president.php">charges that were filed</a> [JURIST reports] by an Australian citizen claiming that during the 2009 Sri Lankan civil war, civilian targets were intentionally bombed by military forces. The charges follow closely behind a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-urged-to-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes.php">call last week</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.icj-aust.org.au/">International Commission of Jurists</a>, Australian Section (ICJA) [advocacy website] for Australia to investigate a top ranking official in the <a href="http://www.slhcaust.org/">Sri Lankan High Commission</a> [official website] in Canberra for war crimes violations allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan Navy during clashes with the LTTE in 2009.  Earlier this month, Samarasinghe, announced the Cabinet of Ministers has <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sri-lanka-unveils-5-year-action-plan-to-protect-human-rights-in-response-to-international-pressure--.php">adopted the National Action Plan</a> [JURIST report] for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights.

The 1986 expiry law was passed after Uruguay returned to democratic rule, shielding police and military personnel from prosecution for torture, killings, enforced disappearances and other serious human rights violations committed during the period of authoritarian rule. Amnesty International (AI) [advocacy website] and other opponents of the amnesty law have repeatedly called for repeal, arguing that the law <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/uruguay-congress-adopts-landmark-law-tackle-impunity-2011-10-27">violates the international human rights principles and treaties</a> [press release] signed and ratified by Uruguay, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention of Human Rights and the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture. Guadalupe Marengo, AI's Deputy Director of Americas Programme, said of the newly passed legislation:<blockquote>With the approval of this new law, Uruguay's Congress has taken an historical step forward in the fight against impunity for past crimes. ... Today's decision by Congress brings Uruguay in line with its obligations under international law and implements part of the ruling made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). All perpetrators of past crimes against humanity should now be brought to justice.</blockquote>The Amnesty Law has been ruled unconstitutional by Uruguay's Supreme Court, but until now survived numerous challenges in Congress. The new legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uruguay-senate-votes-to-revoke-amnesty-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday by the Senate and will now go to <a href="http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/wps/wcm/connect/presidencia/portalpresidencia/presidente">President Jose Mujica</a> [official website, in Spanish], himself a former left-wing militant and Tupamaro leader who was jailed during military rule, for approval. Mujica had previously argued against scrapping amnesty, pointing to referendum results, but has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15473619">indicated that he will sign the new measure</a> [BBC report] before November 1, after which the time limit for trying military-era human rights will expire.

<p>In June Mujica <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/uruguay-president-to-allow-probe-into-military-junta-crimes.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that 80 administrative acts under the amnesty law preventing investigations of crimes committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship will be removed. This revocation only involved the executive branch's administrative acts, leaving it for the courts to decide how to proceed. In May the House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/uruguay-fails-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">failed to repeal</a> the amnesty law due to criticism that the law will allow the prosecution of veterans of the war but not rebel guerrillas. A month earlier, the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/uruguay-senate-votes-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">voted to overturn</a> [JURIST reports] the law by a vote of 16-15. In March the IACHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/human-rights-court-invalidates-uruguay-military-amnesty-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Uruguay's government must bring to justice those responsible for the disappearance of a woman abducted by Uruguay government forces in 1976. In October of last year, the effort to overturn the law through a <a href="http://espectador.com/documentos/nulidad_caducidad.pdf">referendum</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] when only 48 percent voted in support of such change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ICC President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/chambers/the%20judges/the%20judges/judge%20sang%20hyun%20song/judge%20sang_hyun%20song%20_republic%20of%20korea__%20president?lan=en-GB">Sang-Hyun Song</a> [official profile] said that each time a nation joins that tribunal's founding Rome Statute another brick is added to the wall that will protect future generations from "terrible atrocities" like the mass murders and human rights violations the court investigates. "In these times of unprecedented interconnection between States and peoples," said ICJ President <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/?p1=1&p2=2&p3=1&judge=13">Hisashi Owada</a> [official profile], it is his "sincere belief that a firm reliance on international law must underpin any and all future developments on the global stage." Song and Owada each implored the General Assembly delegates to honor the courts' jurisdictions, relying on international law to resolve disputes between states and to suppress the gravest crimes against humanity. The presidents also addressed the issue of ever increasing global expectations for the courts, appealing to all states to support the courts with increased resources to continue work. Some delegates, such as the representative of Sudan, criticized the courts as having diverted from their intended purpose, such as the Rome Statute's linking of a political body like the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] to the ICC, which Sudan's delegate claimed violates the principle of separation of powers and creates a dangerous politicization of international justice. However, the presidents and several delegates noted that courts' dockets are growing increasingly larger and their geographically diverse caseloads speak to the courts' universal natures and to a growing confidence in their decisions.

<p>The ICC is the world's first permanent court mandated to bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The ICC treaty, known as the Rome Statute, entered into force in 2002, four years after 120 states adopted it during the Rome Conference. This week four <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/four-candidates-named-as-potential-successors-to-icc-prosecutor.php">candidates were named</a> [JURIST report] as potential successors to ICC <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] when his nine-year term expires next year. This month Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">visited the Ivory Coast</a> in response to allegations of war crimes committed during post-election violence in the country last November, and the prosecutor subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-singles-out-individuals-for-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">singled out individuals</a> [JURIST reports] for the ICC to investigate. In June Moreno-Ocampo made worldwide headlines by presenting to the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">sufficient evidence to procure arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for deposed Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and two of his high-ranking officials, including Gaddafi's son. Last month the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icc-begins-hearings-in-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">began hearings</a> in Kenya's post-election violence cases against the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">"Ocampo Six"</a> [JURIST reports] for incitement of violence during and after the 2007 Kenyan elections. In August the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-ends-first-war-crimes-trial.php">concludde its first war crimes trial</a> [JURIST report] with the prosecution of a Congo militia leader charged with enlisting child soldiers into his militia, one which is believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in DRC's violent Ituri district. A verdict in the case is expected in early 2012. In addition to the African investigations in Congo, northern Uganda, Libya and Kenya, along with others in the Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, the Office of the Prosecutor is looking at situations in Afghanistan, Colombia, Georgia, Guinea, Honduras, Nigeria and South Korea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 48-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/kenya1011_ToUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], "'Hold Your Heart': Waiting for Justice in Kenya's Mt. Elgon Region," claims that, because the Kenyan government is not adequately investigating these crimes, the ICC should expand its <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Situation+Index.htm">current investigation</a> [ICC materials] in hopes of bringing justice and closure to the victims' families. The ICC is already investigating post-election violence and is looking into six high ranking officials dubbed the "Ocampo Six." The first round of confirmation of charges hearings is <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201110270073.html">coming to a close</a> [<em>Nairobi Star</em> report] with the next round to begin soon. However, HRW claims this is not enough and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/102402/section/3">recommends</a> [text] that the court:<blockquote>Analyze whether crimes falling within the ICC's jurisdiction were committed in Mt. Elgon and consider opening additional investigations in the Kenya situation currently before the ICC to bring to account persons most responsible for these crimes. The Office of the Prosecutor should consider in its analysis crimes committed by both the Sabaot Land Defence Force and Kenyan security forces.</blockquote>The report calls on the ICC to hold the government and others accountable for the violence in the Mt. Elgon region leading up to the disputed election. It concludes that the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/102402/section/10">victims should have access to the justice</a> [text] they have been denied for three years.

<p>The Ocampo Six are <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">facing charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly inciting violence during and after the December 2007 Kenyan elections. They include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website] and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they would not be charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. In April, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. Lawyers for the Ocampo Six called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-ask-for-evidence-from-icc-prosecutor.php">timely release of evidence</a> [JURIST report] against their clients that month as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants were <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1418209-carlotto-tras-la-perpetua-para-astiz-es-un-triunfo-del-bien-sobre-el-mal">charged and convicted</a> [<em>La Nacion</em> report, in Spanish] of various crimes that took place in the Escuela de Mecanica de la Armada (ESMA), which was used by the former military dictatorship as a torture chamber. Argentina's military junta used the location throughout the dictatorship's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>], during which more than 13,000 people were killed. Alfredo Astiz, nicknamed "the Angel of Death" was one of the officers that <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/10/26/argentine-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-police-to-life-in-prison-for-war-crimes/">received a life sentence</a> [AP report]. Astiz is a former navy spy for the dictatorship who was convicted of the murder of two French nuns, a journalist and three founders of a human rights group. Four additional defendants were also convicted, with their sentences ranging from 18 to 25 years in prison. 

<p>The ability of the court to sentence former officials is the result of a 2005 Argentina <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">denied amnesty to military figures</a> [JURIST report] who committed crimes during the military dictatorship. Argentina is not alone in its decision to allow these types of prosecutions. On Thursday, Uruguay's legislature voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uruguay-legislature-repeals-amnesty-law.php">repeal the 1986 amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] which prevented investigations, adjudications and human rights prosecutions of military junta officials during their regime between 1973-1985. Proponents of the law's revocation argue that the amnesty law violates the international human rights principles and treaties signed and ratified by Uruguay. In addition, they claim it is in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention of Human Rights and the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture. Rights groups have also <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-urged-to-revoke-amnesty-law.php">urged Brazil</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-el-salvador-to.php">El Salvador</a> [JURIST reports] to revoke their amnesty laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontegyptflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Proposals for amendments to an Egyptian political corruption law were criticized by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Wednesday for their <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/10/26/egypt-draft-political-corruption-law-invites-abuse">potential for abuse</a> [press release]. HRW reports that the amendments, proposed by the Egyptian <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/">Cabinet of Ministers</a> [official website], would allow authorities to imprison anyone convicted of crimes involving "political corruption," which the organization alleges are vaguely defined, as well as deprive convicted persons of their rights to vote and run for office. As a result of this vague definition, HRW fears individuals will be convicted simply for association with certain political groups and not on the basis of actual criminal activity. While HRW recognizes the interest the new government has in keeping corrupt former officials from affecting the direction the country's government takes into the future, it maintains that these amendments are too arbitrary to be effective in this way. Instead, HRW recommends that Egypt refrain from basing judgments on the ability to hold political authority on past or present associations and require clear and convincing evidence that the "individual in question knowingly and actively furthered criminal practices of the organization." The proposals at issue seek to amend the country's 1952 "Law on Political Treachery," which would be renamed "The Political Corruption Law." 

<p>The country's upcoming election has resulted in a variety of legislative and court activity. Earlier this month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report] that prohibited presidential hopeful <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4558054.stm">Ayman Nour</a> [BBC profile] from forming a political party and also prohibited the formation of the Islamic-based political party <a href="http://www.egyig.com/">Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya</a> [party website]. The decision will <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7LA2XW20111010">allow political parties</a> [Reuters report] previously banned because of their religious foundations to participate in the upcoming November parliamentary elections. The court found that Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya's party, "Construction and Development," should be allowed to participate in the elections because its founders consist of Muslims and non-Muslims and the party does not mandate the religion of its members. While the decision marks progress in Egypt's journey towards democratic rule, certain election prohibitions continue to restrict its progress. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder] recently amended election rules to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">ban the use of religious slogans in campaigning</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Council stated that "[e]lectoral campaigns based on the use of religious slogans or on racial or gender segregation are banned," adding that violators could be fined and face up to three months in jail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

DOMA defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman. The suit alleges that DOMA unconstitutionally denies gay and lesbian service members equal protection under the law. The suit further alleges that "[t]here is no enumerated power in the Constitution that allows the federal government to define marriage in such a way as to deny Plaintiffs the benefits they seek, and the Tenth Amendment entrusts the regulation of marriage to the states." The plaintiffs are seeking:<blockquote>[T]he same recognition, family support and benefits for their same-sex spouses that the military has provided and currently provides to opposite-sex spouses of current and former service members. These benefits include medical and dental benefits, basic housing allowances, travel and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, military ID cards, visitation rights in military hospitals, survivor benefits, and the right to be buried together in military cemeteries.</blockquote>Major Shannon McLaughlin, one of the lead plaintiffs in the case, said that she had a <a href="http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/10/27/Gay_Service_Members_Sue_for_Equal_Benefits/">"duty" to fight for equality</a> [<em>Advocate</em> report]. <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &#38; Lesbian Advocates &#38; Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy website] is expected to file a brief in support of SLDN's lawsuit.

<p>In September <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/dadt/">backgrounder</a>] was officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report]. With the repeal of the law, the military can no longer prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly among its ranks. US <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] told gay rights activists earlier this month that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA, reinforcing that the DOJ is not defending its constitutionality. However, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced in March that he was launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution." In February, congressional Democrats introduced the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report], but it has not yet passed. A July 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Currently DOMA allows other states to ignore those recognized same-sex marriages, and prevents same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits available to married couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Poland is not alone in its pursuit to remedy crimes committed during the Holocaust.

The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], alleges discriminatory practices against more than 90,000 women regarding pay and job promotion. The suit is expected to be the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-27/wal-mart-workers-limit-gender-bias-suit-to-california-stores.html">first of many cases against the retailer</a> [Bloomberg report] broken down by state and region.

<p>In August, a judge <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/staticdata/Tolling%20Order.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] that a group of women seeking to recover damages from Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-sets-deadline-in-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-suit.php">must file their lawsuits by October 28</a> [JURIST report].  In June, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-277">Wal-Mart v.

The original case was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contended that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wal-mart-appeals-class-action-certification-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court in August 2010 after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST reports] in April of that year. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit originally ruled against Wal-Mart's appeal of the class certification in February 2007, then issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/10/0416688.pdf">new opinion</a> [text, PDF] in conjunction with its decision in December 2007. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/wal-mart-asks-ninth-circuit-to-dismiss.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Ninth Circuit in 2005, arguing that the six lead plaintiffs were not typical or common of the class. The certified class, which in 2001 was estimated to comprise more than 1.5 million women, includes all women employed by Wal-Mart nationwide at any time after December 26, 1998.

Libya's <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] reported earlier this week that Saif al-Islam and former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi were <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/gaddafi-son-intelligence-chief-reportedly-seeking-surrender-to-icc.php">attempting to leave Libya</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to surrender themselves to the ICC, although the ICC was unable to confirm the report at that time. In June, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi alleging they had committed crimes against humanity in connection with the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Ocampo indicated that Saif al-Islam has been informed through intermediate channels that if he surrenders he will have the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7LS2M920111028?sp=true">right to a trial</a> [Reuters report], and he will be considered innocent until proven guilty. Ocampo also stated that the ICC was considering the possibility of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15496608">intercepting a plane</a> [BBC report] with Saif al-Islam on it, if the plane is in the airspace of a country that is a party to the ICC. According to Ocampo, mercenaries are offering to move Saif al-Islam to a country that is not a party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF]. Saif al-Islam's location is currently unknown, but he is believed to be in Niger. Reports have indicated that Saif al-Islam could seek refuge in Zimbabwe, which is not a signatory of the Rome Statute, if he chooses to avoid ICC prosecution. 

<p>On Sunday, Libyan transitional <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=8&ParentID=3&LangID=1">Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril</a> [official profile] declared the country's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">official liberation</a> [JURIST report] from the regime of Gaddafi and set a schedule for establishing a new government. Jibril made the announcement in front of thousands of supporters celebrating in the city of Benghazi, the location of the NTC and where the first uprisings sparked the Libya conflict eight months ago. The declaration of liberation came three days after Gaddafi's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">capture and death</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of opposition forces in his hometown of Sirte. The NTC has formed a committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-leader-orders-investigation-into-gaddafi-death.php">investigate the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's death</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-office-calls-for-investigation-into-gaddafi-killing.php">pressure</a> [JURIST reports] from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], rights groups including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and international governments. An autopsy has confirmed that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2097580,00.html">died from a gun shot wound to the head</a> [AP report], but interim Libya leader <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=7&ParentID=3&LangID=1">Mustafa Abdul-Jalil</a> [official profile] has suggested that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyas-leader-orders-investigation-of-gadhafis-death-under-international-pressure/2011/10/24/gIQAdKAFCM_story.html">may have been killed by his own supporters</a> [AP report] to prevent him from implicating them in any crimes under his regime. Gaddafi's death marks the latest milestone in the Libya conflict, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] as part of a wider protest movement, commonly referred to as the "Arab Spring," that had spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The claimant, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1907462.stm">Abu Zubaydah</a> [BBC profile], is a Palestinian who was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and taken to multiple CIA black sites, where he claims he was the victim of various human rights violations. According to Zubaydah and supported by government intelligence reports, the prisoner was <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">waterboarded approximately 83 times</a> [CIA memo, PDF] while in Thailand. He was then flown from Morocco to a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=secret+prison">secret detention facility</a> [JURIST news archive] in Lithuania in February 2005, where he was supposedly tortured once again. Despite two previous probes dropped by the Lithuanian government in January 2009, officials have stated that they will consider re-opening a criminal investigation in light of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/rendition-victim-takes-case-against-lithuania-european-court-2011-10-27">increasing pressure</a> [press release] from human rights groups like <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website]. Lithuania is the only European country to have admitted directly working with CIA officials to provide these secret detention facilities, but nothing else.

<p>The Lithuanian probe is not the first time that Zubaydah has urged countries to examine the often controversial methods of the US rendition program. In December 2010, Zubaydah <a href="href="/paperchase/2010/12/guantanamo-detainee-asks-poland-to-probe-alleged-cia-secret-prison.php">asked Polish prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate his alleged abuse at a secret CIA prison in Poland, where he claims he was the victim of enhanced interrogation techniques. Likewise, in April 2007, the alleged al Qaeda loyalist <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/transcript_ISN10016.pdf">denied ties to terrorism</a> [transcript] and <a href="href="/paperchase/2007/04/high-value-guantanamo-detainee-denies.php"">asked a US Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> [JURIST report] to investigate his claims of torture. Zubaydah was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/bush-confirms-existence-of-secret-cia.php">transferred to Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report] in September 2006 as one of <a href="http://www.dni.gov/announcements/content/DetaineeBiographies.pdf">14 "high value" terror suspects</a> [DNI profile], and has remained there since.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and a group of 26 states <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-appeal-to-supreme-court-on-health-care-law.php">filed petitions with the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] seeking a ruling on the constitutionality of PPACA. The petitions for <em>certiorari</em> filed by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/healthcare/docs/hhs-v-florida-petition-certiorari.pdf">DOJ</a> and <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8M5KCL/$file/HC_StatesPetitiontoUSSupremeCt.pdf">states</a> [cert. petitions, PDF] seek review of a decision handed down by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] in August. The Eleventh Circuit found the PPACA individual health care mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but upheld the remainder of the law without the mandate. The ACLJ's brief argues that the Eleventh Circuit erred in finding the individual mandate severable from the remainder of the law. They argue that because the individual mandate is the essential component of the PPACA it cannot be severed from the rest of the act. The entire act, they maintain, should therefore be struck down as unconstitutional. The ACLJ states that the split between the circuits over the constitutionality of the law has created a "matter of national importance," making a grant of review appropriate at this time. 

<p>There are currently several health care appeals pending before the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> [official website] filed an <a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/sites/default/files/scotus/files/2011/National%20Federation%20of%20Independent%20Business,%20et%20al.%20v.%20Sebelius,%20et%20al.%20(NCLC%20Amicus%20Brief%20in%20Support%20of%20Cert.%20Petitions%20Nos.%2011-393,%2011-398,%2011-400).pdf"><em>amicus</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] asking the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/chamber-of-commerce-urges-supreme-court-to-resolve-health-care-controversy.php">agree to resolve the deepening legal conflict</a> [JURIST report] over the constitutionality of PPACA. In addition to the appeal of the Eleventh Circuit's decision, earlier this month both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/virginia-appeals-health-care-dismissal-to-supreme-court.php">state of Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php">Liberty University appealed</a> a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed their challenges for lack of standing</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law in June</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">that ruling was also appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> [advocacy website]. The Supreme Court is likely to rule on the issue next summer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Failing to do so, they say, calls the Ukrainian government's commitment to "democracy and European values" into question and may jeopardize Ukrainian relations with the EU. Tymoshenko, who was the leader of both the <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60620/adrian-karatnycky/ukraines-orange-revolution">2004 Orange Revolution</a> [CFR backgrounder] and the <a href="http://batkivshchyna.te.ua/">opposition party</a> [party website, in Ukrainian], was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of abuse of her power earlier this month and sentenced to seven years in prison. The court fined Tymoshenko USD $190 million and forbade her from holding political office for three years. The verdict brought harsh backlash from the international community that saw the process as purely political. Tymoshenko, who accused the court of being a "puppet" of the president, has vowed to appeal the decision.

<p>Relations between the EU and Ukraine <a href="http://www.einnews.com/pr-news/584459-european-parliament-recommends-to-offer-ukraine-the-eu-membership-perspective">appeared to be strengthening</a> [PR Newswire report] as Ukraine was setting itself up for potential EU membership. However, conflict arose earlier this month when Tymoshenko was officially convicted of abusing her power when she signed a gas agreement with Russia that was alleged to have violated <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> [text].

Sanader has suffered from coronary problems and is expected to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15488522">undergo a medical examination</a> [BBC report] in preparation for trial now scheduled to start next week. Sanader, who was elected to parliament after he stepped down from the prime minister position in 2009, stands accused of corruption, abuse of power and fraud for taking nearly <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">&#8364;4 million from public firms and state institutions</a> [JURIST report]. The former prime minister denies any wrongdoing. The trial in Zagreb is scheduled to start next Thursday, November 3.

<p>This high profile corruption charge comes as Croatia comes close to EU membership, hoping to join in July 2013. Sanader was indicted in September for corruption. The country's Bureau for Combating Corruption and Organized Crime (USKOK) alleged <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">Sanader received a pay-off</a> [JURIST report] of more than 3.6 million kuna (nearly USD $695,000) from Austria's Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank in exchange for the country entering into a loan agreement to receive 140 million Austrian Schillings (USD $14.7 million) in order to place the bank in the Croatian market. Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/Austria-extradites-Croatia-ex-PM-to-face-corruption-charges.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to Croatia in July in order to face these charges after he was arrested in Austria last December. Sanader argued that it would be impossible to receive a fair trail in Croatia, but he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">dropped it after media speculation</a> [JURIST report] suggested the appeal could harm EU Croatia's accession.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the second round of settlements given to farmers who were discriminated against over a decade ago. The plaintiffs in this case missed the filing date in October 1999, so they were not included in a settlement made that year. After Congress passed a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6124eh.txt">bill</a> [text] in 2008 waiving the statute of limitations to give these farmers another chance to pursue their claims, the National Black Farmers Association filed suit on behalf of 800 black farmers. Federal Judge Paul Friedman issued final approval of the settlement Thursday:<blockquote>Today, because of a Congress that was willing to once again waive the statute of limitations and to appropriate $1.25 billion to help further redress the historic discrimination against African-American farmers, the Court is pleased to approve the settlement agreement proposed by the Moving Plaintiffs, and endorsed by the United States, a fair, reasonable, and adequate.</blockquote>US Attorney General Eric Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2011/10/0465.xml&contentidonly=true">welcomed the settlement</a> [press release] as an "important step to ensure some level of justice for black farmers and ranchers who faced discrimination when trying to obtain services from USDA."

<p>The farmers faced many procedural challenges over the past 12 years in pursuing their cases before the settlement was finally <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/senate-approves-minority-farmer-settlements.php">approved by the Senate</a> last November and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-bill-funding-minority-farmer-settlements.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST reports] by President Barack Obama. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/usda-reaches-125-billion-settlement-in.php">settlement was reached</a> [JURIST report] with the USDA in February 2010, but the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/black-farmers-urge-us-senate-to-fund-settlement-in-discrimination-case.php">failed seven times</a> [JURIST report] to fund it. In May 2008, then-president George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/bush-farm-bill-veto-threatens-potential.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] which would have allowed the farmers to file suit after missing the original filing deadline. A month later, Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/congress-overrides-second-bush-farm.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] this veto, and the bill passed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Garzon was <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201104/11/espana/20110411elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-high-court-indicts-judge-garzon-for-jailhouse-wiretap-order.php">report</a>] in April for ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers. Garzon gave the order as part of an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5j-lRuSEaMuU4eqMyD0OY235jzEVA?docId=6531319">investigation</a> [AP report] into a network of businesses that allegedly gave money and gifts to members of Spain's Popular Party in exchange for government contracts. He believed that the visiting lawyers may have been acting as liaisons between inmates and others involved in the criminal network. The court found, however, that Garzon continued to record the privileged conversations even after he learned that the majority of them discussed defense strategies. The November 29 trial will be the first of two for Garzon, who in 2010 was <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201004/07/espana/20100407elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">charged</a> [order, PDF, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">report</a>] with abuse of power and suspended from his position. No date has been set for a trial on this charge. 

<p>In March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 charges of abuse of power. In that case, Garzon is charged with politically motivated corruption in his investigation of crimes committed under the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Franco dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder], in violation of the 1977 Amnesty Law, which affords amnesty for Franco-era crimes. The charges are based on Garzon's 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">order</a> [JURIST report] for certain government agencies, the Episcopal Conference, the University of Granada and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement concluded the dispute that charged Citigroup with having misled its investors about a $1 billion loan that defaulted. The result left investors to bear the burden while Citigroup reaped $160 million in profits from trading and fees. Judge Jed Rakoff directed both parties to answer nine questions pertaining to the $285 million settlement. One of Rakoff's principal issues is why the SEC imposed a $95 million penalty on Citigroup but imposed a $535 million <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/judgment-pr2010-123.pdf">penalty</a> [PDF, settlement agreement] on Goldman Sachs in a July 2010 suit. The judge also found fault with the reasoning behind the settlement and asked the parties prepare to defend their reasoning:<blockquote>How was the amount of the proposed judgment determined? In particular, what calculations went into the determination of the $95 million penalty? Why, for example, is the penalty in this case less than one-fifth of the $535 million penalty assessed in <span class="casename">SEC v. Goldman Sachs &#38; Co</span>. Why should the Court impose a judgment in a case in which the S.E.C. alleges a serious securities fraud but the defendant neither admits nor denies wrongdoing?</blockquote>The next hearing is scheduled for November 9 when both sides will be required to answer the questions set out in the order.

<p>This is not the first time that Rakoff has questioned settlements between the SEC and major financial corporations. In February 2010 he accepted a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/27269855/Rakoff-s-Approval-of-Bank-of-America-S-E-C-Settlement">settlement</a> [agreement; JURIST <a href="paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-approves-150-million-sec.php">report</a>] agreement between the SEC and Bank of America after <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-rejects-bank-of-america.php">twice rejecting it</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-rejects-sec-bank-of.php">report</a>] as unfair to investors. This is also not the first time the SEC has taken issue with Citigroup's dealings with investors. In July 2010 the two sides <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/sec-citigroup-settle-for-75-million.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a settlement in regards to the SEC's claim that Citigroup misled investors about it's exposure to sub-prime mortgage-related assets. That agreement penalized the company $75 million. It was also <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rejects-sec-citigroup-subprime-mortgage-settlement.php">rejected</a> in August 2010 when a federal judge demanded to know how it was reached and why the investors were forced to bear the majority of the cost, but not the majority of the executives. The settlement was <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/news/2010/10_-_october/judge_gives_final_signoff_on_citigroup-sec_deal/">approved</a> [Reuters report] October 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gibbs' trial follows an 18-month investigation into crimes committed by US military personnel as part of the war in Afghanistan. Gibbs now faces <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/us-soldiers-crimes-idUSTRE79R2DW20111028?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews">three counts of premeditated murder</a> [Reuters report], in addition to charges for cutting off the fingers, dismantling dead bodies and assaulting a soldier for notifying superiors of drug abuse within the unit. If convicted on all charges, Gibbs could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors have depicted Gibbs as the instigator of the atrocities against Afghan civilians by the 5th Stryker Brigade. Seven other soldiers faced charges for lesser offenses, but most of the others have agreed to plea deals. Pentagon officials have said that exposure of this misconduct has damaged the image of the US abroad. 

<p>In September, Private Andrew Holmes, 21, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/second-us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to murdering a teenage Afghan civilian that he knew was unarmed. Holmes was the second soldier to plead guilty of five who have been charged with murder as part of a plot contrived with fellow soldiers to kill Afghan civilians which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. In May, US Army prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-army-charges-sixth-soldier-in-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">charged a sixth soldier</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in a murder plot that led to the deaths of three Afghan civilians. Bram was the sixth soldier from the 5th Stryker Brigade to be charged in connection with the three Afghan deaths, which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfcc.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] announced comprehensive changes on Thursday to its national communications subsidy program to make <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-310695A1.pdf">high-speed internet access available in rural areas</a> [press release, PDF]. The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/connecting-america">Connect America Fund</a> [official website; <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-310692A1.pdf">executive summary</a>, PDF] will have an annual budget of USD $4.5 billion, and the FCC estimates that the program will create more than 500,000 jobs while providing high-speed Internet access to more than 7 million Americans. The FCC described the previous system, the <a href="http://www.usac.org/about/universal-service/">Universal Services Fund</a> [official website], as "broken." The new program also makes mobile broadband "an independent universal service objective for the first time in history" and reforms intercarrier compensation to eliminate hidden costs in bills. FCC chairman Julius Genachowski called this a <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-310695A2.pdf">"once-in-a-generation overhaul"</a> [text, PDF]:<blockquote>We are taking a system designed for the Alexander Graham Bell era of rotary telephones and modernizing it for the era of Steve Jobs and the Internet future he imagined. We are reaffirming for the digital age the fundamental American promise of opportunity for all. We are furthering our national goal of connecting the country to wired and wireless broadband. And we are helping put America on its proper 21stcentury footing, positioning us to lead the world in a fiercely competitive global digital economy. Infrastructure has always been a key pillar of American economic success, with telephone and other infrastructure connecting consumers and businesses, facilitating commerce, and unleashing innovation. Broadband is the indispensible infrastructure of our 21stcentury economy.</blockquote>The commission argued that high-speed Internet has become a necessity and thus all Americans should have access to it. Over 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies only post job openings online and studies have shown that students with access to broadband at home graduate at a rate of 6 to 8 percent higher than children in homes without access to broadband.

<p>The FCC has faced controversy when it comes to regulating the Internet. <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">Verizon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">MetroPCS</a> [JURIST reports] filed challenges in January out of concern over the FCC's broad authority under its new net neutrality rules. Last year, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/senators-introduce-legislation-to-block-fcc-broadband-plan.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court ruling found that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality</a> [JURIST report]. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The actions in question are part of a coordinated effort <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2011/144.html">announced earlier this month</a> [press release] by California's four US Attorneys, including indictments, civil forfeiture lawsuits against owners of property on which medical marijuana dispensaries operate and dozens of warning letters to other operators and landlords of marijuana stores and to local officials who might implement the state's decriminalization law. ASA's complaint acknowledges the federal government's right to enforce in the states "in an even-handed manner" federal criminal laws against marijuana, but cites the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt10_user.html#amdt10_hd6">Tenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] as protecting California's sovereign right to decriminalize marijuana for medical use:<blockquote>ASA does not challenge the congressional authority to enact laws criminalizing possession and/or control of marijuana ... Nor does ASA challenge the federal government's general authority to enforce its drug laws in the State of California. It is, rather, the government's <em>tactics</em>, and the unlawful assault on state sovereignty they represent, that form the gravamen of ASA's claim. Under the Tenth Amendment, the government may not commandeer the law-making functions of the State of its subdivisions directly or indirectly through the selective enforcement of its drug laws.</blockquote>Essentially the suit accuses federal agencies of commandeering California's legislative function and interfering with local laws meant to distinguish between medical and non-medical use. ASA's lawsuit was brought on behalf of its 20,000 California members who are "directly and adversely affected" by the federal government's actions.

<p>US courts have been forced to interpret medical marijuana statutes in recent years. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] announced in June that the state is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">filing a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality of the state's controversial medical marijuana law passed last November. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. Earlier that month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November 2009, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island and New Mexico. California's Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report] and does not violate the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law defines "terrorists" as "those who organize, plot and conduct terrorist acts as well as those who are members of terrorist groups," and terrorist acts as "those acts which are intended to induce public fear or to coerce state organs or international organizations by means of violence, sabotage, threats or other tactics." In an <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/29/idINIndia-60189920111029">effort to unify enforcement</a> [Reuters report], authorities will now have the power to publish lists of terror suspects and freeze their assets. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/china-considers-new-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">proposed last week</a> [JURIST report] before the Standing Committee of China' National People's Congress (NPC) [official website] in order to amend China's criminal law that failed to define the terms "terrorist" and "terrorist organization," or to define what constitutes "terrorist acts." Chinese Vice Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-10/24/c_131210079.htm">emphasized the danger of having no clear definitions</a> [Xinhua report] in the current law, noting in his report to the NPC that "China is faced with the real threat of terrorist activities, and the struggle with terrorism is long-term, complicated and acute." 

<p>Other countries have also recently considered amending their anti-terrorism laws. In August, <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/default.aspx">Philippine President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website] urged lawmakers to enhance a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/philippines-president-urges-lawmakers-to-strengthen-anti-terrorism-law.php">controversial anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] by removing provisions that deter authorities from using the law. The proposed change would reduce the $11,700-per-day fine imposed on police or military forces who wrongfully detain terror suspects, as well as removal of a provision requiring suspects to be alerted when they are placed under surveillance. The current law faces criticism from opponents who say its language is overly broad and that is has rarely been used. Also in August, Saudi Arabian officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/saudi-arabia-amends-highly-criticized-anti-terrorism-law.php">proposed amendments</a> [JURIST report] to a draft anti-terrorism law that would criminalize taking up arms against the king or crown prince. The Saudi Arabian draft law has been sharply criticized by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] which alleges the proposed law conflicts with international human rights treatises.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcanada.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> Friday declared that the <a href="http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/NS/index-eng.asp">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</a> (CHRT) [official websites] does not have the power to award compensation for legal costs. The high court's 7-0 <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc53/2011scc53.html">decision</a> [judgment text] states that the language used in the relevant federal statute <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Canadian+Human+Rights+Tribunal+award+legal+costs+court/5624685/story.html">does not allow for the awarding of legal costs</a> [<em>Vancouver Sun</em> report] in the same manner prescribed by most provincial and territorial statutes. The ruling by the Supreme Court concluded the case of Donna Mowat, a former Canadian Forces traffic technician who was awarded $4,000 by the CHRT for sexual discrimination by her superiors. She was also awarded $47,000 for her legal costs, which the Federal Court upheld, but sent back for review since Mowat initially had sought $196,000 following the six-week hearing. The federal appeals court, however, found the tribunal had no jurisdiction to award any legal costs, and the Supreme Court agreed:<blockquote>The precise interpretive question before the Tribunal was whether the words ... which authorize the Tribunal to "compensate the victim for ... any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice" permit an award of legal costs. No reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions can support the view that the Tribunal may award legal costs to successful complainants. Faced with a difficult point of statutory interpretation and conflicting judicial authority, the Tribunal adopted a dictionary meaning of "expenses" and articulated what it considered to be a beneficial policy outcome rather than engaging in an interpretative process taking account of the text, context and purpose of the provisions in issue. A liberal and purposive interpretation [is required to evaluate human rights legislation, but such an interpretation] cannot supplant a textual and contextual analysis simply in order to give effect to a policy decision different from the one made by Parliament.</blockquote>The decision has raised questions regarding its effect on victims of alleged rights abuses who may avoid mounting cases for fear of cost, particularly when the maximum payout for pain and suffering is capped at $20,000. Conversely, some argue human rights commissions by their very nature are designed to deal with cases more expeditiously than the courts and without the need for expensive legal representation. However many, including Mowat's pro boon attorney, have stated such cases are very complex and necessarily produce large legal fees, and now it will be up to Parliament to amend the federal act to protect successful claimants who are subsequently saddled with huge attorneys' fees.

<p>The Supreme Court has made several important decisions in recent months. In July the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/canada-supreme-court-rules-federal-government-not-liable-for-tobacco-related-ailments.php">issued rulings</a> [JURIST report] in two major tobacco products cases, relieving the Canadian government of liability for tobacco-related health problems and allowing the provinces to sue the tobacco industry for damages for tobacco-related health care costs. The court <a href = "http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc42/2011scc42.html">ruled</a> [text; <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=33559">materials</a>] unanimously in <span class = "casename">R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</span> that the federal government is not liable for any tobacco-related death or illness. In the same opinion the court <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=33563">ruled</a> [materials] in <span class = "casename">Attorney General of Canada v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia</span> that individual provinces are able to sue tobacco companies for damages to offset the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses. In June the court declared that it would hear an appeal of convicted terrorist <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/khawaja_mohammad.html">Mohammed Momin Khawaja</a> [CBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khawaja">news archive</a>], <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/news_release/2011/11-06-30.3a/11-06-30.3a.pdf">granting an application for leave to appeal</a> [judgment, PDF] filed by Khawaja challenging the life sentence imposed by the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Ontario Court of Appeals</a> [official website]. In March the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/canada-supreme-court-to-review-ban-on-muslim-veil-during-testimony.php">agreed to review a lower court order</a> [JURIST report] requiring a Muslim woman to remove her <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_1.shtml">niqab</a> [BBC backgrounder] while testifying after the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] in October <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/ontario-high-court-allows-witnesses-to-wear-niqab-unless-unfair-to-accused.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a witness does not have to remove her veil unless the failure to do so will prevent the accused from receiving a fair trial, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Ocampo, Saif al-Islam, who remains on the run from authorities, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/30/us-libya-idUSTRE79S34620111030">hired mercenaries</a> [Reuters report] to assist him in carrying out his plans to attack civilians that protested the rule of his father, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>]. The "substantial evidence" against Saif al-Islam is mostly in the form of witness reports, and the court remains in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-in-contact-with-gaddafis-son-over-possible-surrender.php">indirect contact</a> with him, where there has been talk of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/gaddafi-son-intelligence-chief-reportedly-seeking-surrender-to-icc.php">possible surrender</a> [JURIST reports]. The ICC had previously met with Libyan rebel leaders, who had <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">allegedly captured Saif al-Islam</a> [JURIST report], in August to discuss turning him over to authorities for the purposes of a prosecution. However, Saif was free by September, when he <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8734174/Libya-Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi-vows-to-continue-the-war-and-retake-Tripoli.html">vowed to continue fighting</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report].

<p>The ability of the ICC to negotiate a possible surrender of Saif al-Islam is a result of his desire to avoid the fate of his father, who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">killed by opposition fighters</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. On Monday, Interim Libyan leader <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=7&amp;ParentID=3&amp;LangID=1">Mustafa Abdul-Jalil</a> [official profile] ordered an investigation into Gaddafi's death. He said that the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transition Council</a> [official website] has formed a committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's capture and death in his hometown of Sirte. Abdul-Jalil's statement came amid <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-office-calls-for-investigation-into-gaddafi-killing.php">pressure</a> [JURIST report] from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], rights groups including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and international governments for an official investigation. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAB6aYDnu1k">Cell phone videos</a> [WARNING: graphic images] taken during Gaddafi's capture have surfaced depicting wounded and bloodied Gaddafi alive but enduring torment and beatings by his captors while being carried and placed into the back of a truck. An autopsy confirmed that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2097580,00.html">died from a gun shot wound to the head</a> [AP report], but Abdul-Jalil suggested Monday that Gaddafi <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyas-leader-orders-investigation-of-gadhafis-death-under-international-pressure/2011/10/24/gIQAdKAFCM_story.html">may have been killed by his own supporters</a> [AP report] to prevent him from implicating them in any crimes under his regime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prior to amendment, the law treated youth 16 years and older as adults, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYbx25TYiF9rJxtay0f6KTxM92kQ?docId=CNG.db36bfab46eee355ae8cabe781314432.701">allowing them to be arrested</a> [AFP report]. Now, no one under the age of 18 will be detained for purposes of prosecution under the act. The PSA also allows the detention of individuals deemed to be threats to the state for up to two years before they can stand trial&#8212;a provision which remains in effect. However, detention periods for other crimes have been reduced as a part of the amendments. Changes to the law may have resulted from pressure on India's government and the local government in Kashmir by human rights groups, among others. In March, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that the PSA was being used to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/amnesty-international-concerned-about-extrajudicial-detentions-in-jammu-and-kashmir.php">detain hundreds of people</a> [JURIST report] despite the absence of sufficient evidence for a trial. AI then called on the relevant governments to carry out an independent, impartial and comprehensive investigation into allegations of abuses against detainees and their families, including allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, denial of visits and medical care, making its findings public and holding those responsible to account. 

<p>Last month, under pressure from AI, Kashmir promised to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/kashmir-promises-identification-of-recently-uncovered-bodies.php">take steps to identify</a> [JURIST report] the thousands of bodies that were found in mass and single graves by the <a href="http://nhrc.nic.in/shrc.htm#shrcJAMMUANDKASHMIR">State Human Rights Commission</a> (SHRC) [official website]. Kashmir's Chief Minister <a href="http://www.omarabdullah.com/">Omar Abdullah</a> [personal website] announced that officials will carry out DNA tests on the thousands of bodies recently uncovered in unmarked graves in the country's northern region. Abdullah called for families of missing persons to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15082365?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">provide DNA samples</a> [BBC report] for testing. The SHRC had also called for an investigation into the identities of the remains, but, according to AI, their calls have been ignored. An additional 574 bodies were found, but those were later identified by local residents. Kashmir has remained <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/india-and-pakistan-resume-peace-talks.php">rife with unrest since it became part of India</a> [JURIST report] in the middle of the twentieth century. Kashmir and Jammu, which is officially part of India, has been disputed between Pakistan and India since 1947. Claims by both Pakistan and India to the territory have resulted in several conflicts in the region, particularly the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1947-1948 and 1965. In addition, there was a large show of military force by both nations in the region in 2002 that caused international alarm because both nations have nuclear weapons. India has sought to stifle unrest and a burgeoning separatist movement in the region by detaining human rights and political activists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The violence has erupted most recently in the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama.

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11493&amp;LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] the international community to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-international-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">protect civilian lives in Syria</a> [JURIST report], where more than 3,000 civilians have been killed since protests against the government began. This statement followed a report from a UN commission <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2011/09/syria-urged-to-allow-human-rights-experts-to-visit-the-country/">urging</a> [statement] Syrian authorities to allow human rights experts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/syria-urged-to-allow-un-investigation-of-rights-violations.php">conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of human rights violations. In August, Pillay called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">violent suppression of anti-government protests</a> [JURIST report].

The ICTB, a special court established to try individuals suspected of war crimes in relation to the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] against Pakistan, was slated to hear arguments in the case of Delwar Hossain Sayedee, leader of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">Jamaat e Islami</a> (JI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], on Sunday. Sayedee's lawyer has asked the tribunal to review the charges against his client. The <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/10/2011103010158155404.html">tribunal accepted 20 of 31 charges</a> [Al Jazeera report] including allegations of aiding Pakistani soldiers, murder, torching villages, rape, looting and forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. Sayedee has denied the charges. The Jamaat-e-Islami party, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-court-charges-senior-opposition-leader-with-war-crimes-from-1971-war.php">openly campaigned against breaking away</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan during the war, has accused the tribunal of targeting political opponents. The trial is scheduled to resume on November 20.

<p>In July, Bangladesh prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bangladesh-prosecutors-charge-islamic-leader-with-war-crimes.php">filed the underlying war crime charges</a> [JURIST report] in the ICTB against Sayedee. Earlier that month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/07/11/bangladesh-guarantee-fair-trials-independence-era-crimes">praised recent reforms</a> [press release] to the ICTB but urged it to do more to ensure fair trials, including allowing an accused to question the impartiality of the tribunal, which the law currently prohibits. In July 2010, the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-issues-arrest-warrants-for-islamist-leaders.php">issued four arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for the leaders of Jamaat e Islami, including Sayedee, for alleged crimes committed during the Liberation War.

The suit, filed by four <a href="http://www.iium.edu.my/">International Islamic University of Malaysia</a> [official website] students in 2010, challenged the constitutionality of the 1971 <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%201/Act%2030.pdf">Universities and University Colleges Act</a> (UUCA) [text, PDF]. Under section 15 of the UUCA, students are not permitted to "be a member of, or ... in any manner associate with, any society, political party, trade union or any other organization, body or group of persons whatsoever." The court ruled that this prohibition violates the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/malaysia.pdf">Malaysian Constitution</a> [text, PDF], specifically the protection of the freedom of expression. The students' lawyer, Ashok Kandiah, called the ruling a "landmark decision." The International Islamic University of Malaysia has said it will <a href="http://my.news.yahoo.com/malaysia-court-rules-against-student-politics-ban-082009642.html">appeal the ruling</a> [AFP report] to the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/?q=en/node/596">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website] the nation's highest court.

<p>The constitutional challenge to the UUCA is not the only ongoing legal challenge to long standing Malaysian law. Early this month, Malaysia's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-releases-125-prisoners-in-plan-to-repeal-strict-security-law.php">released 125 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who were being held under a decades-old security law that has been widely criticized by human rights and opposition groups. In an address to <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/index.php?modload=sites&action=innerpage&id=5&view=23&uweb=p&lang=en">Parliament</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-najib-razak/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] announced the release of all individuals being held under the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20377.pdf">Restricted Residence Act of 1933</a> [text, PDF], the British colonial-era act that enables authorities to banish suspects to remote districts and force them to report regularly to police. In September, Razak announced that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">repeal two strict security laws</a> [JURIST report] that had allowed extended detention of suspects without trial. The government also said that it will review other laws dealing with freedom of the press, including the Restricted Residence Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mubarak and his co-defendants were present in the courtroom for the short hearing at which the lengthy adjournment was announced. Mubarak is facing charges of complicity in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">deaths of more than 800 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] that resulted in Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">stepping down in February</a> [JURIST report]. The adjournment will allow the court time to rule on a motion made by lawyers representing the victims' families to have the three judge panel in the case removed. The victims' families argue they were <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/2011103011331929580.html">not given enough time</a> [Al Jazeera report] to question Field Marshal <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/tantawi.htm">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], head of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] currently ruling Egypt. Tantawi, who served as Mubarak's defense minister for over 20 years, testified against Mubarak in a closed-session but left early and refused to be cross-examined by counsel for the victims. Due to the closed-session, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-s-military-ruler-testifies-in-mubarak-trial-1.386511">nothing has been revealed about the testimony</a> [AP report], nor how the lawyers' actions stem from it. A ruling on that motion is expected on November 3. 

<p>Mubarak is on trial for murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [Al Jazeera report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy demonstrations in Egypt earlier this year. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges. Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges. In July, officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place in downtown Cairo. Also in July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">human rights groups accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak could <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The tribunal filed an indictment against Seselj in February 2010 for disclosing the names, occupations and places of residence of 11 protected witnesses in violation of the tribunal's order. Seselj admitted that he authored the book after protective orders were given in relation to 10 of the 11 witnesses, and a plea of not guilty was entered on his behalf after he refused to enter a plea. After a <a href="http://icty.org/x/cases/contempt_seselj2/cis/en/cis_seselj_contempt_second_en.pdf">trial</a> [case information sheet, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-begins-contempt-trial-over-witness-identity-revelations.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in February 2011 and concluded in June, the ICTY found that "the Accused knew he was disclosing information which identified ten of the witnesses and revealed that they could be involved in the Seselj case when he published the Book, and that he did so intentionally, with the knowledge that by doing so, he was violating decisions of the Seselj Trial Chamber." The tribunal emphasized the "deliberate way" in which Seselj violated the protective order and considered the adverse impact that his conduct may have upon witnesses trusting the Tribunal to guarantee to protect their identity. The tribunal also considered Selsej's lack of remorse and the widespread availability of the book in print and electronic forms when determining the scope of the disclosure. 

<p>The 18-month sentence imposed on Monday is the conclusion of the second of three contempt charges filed against Seselj. The first charge resulted in a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">15-month sentence</a> that he will serve concurrently with the 18-month sentence, and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icty-chrages-seselj-with-contempt-over-confidential-information-on-website.php">third charge</a> [JURIST reports] is currently underway. Seselj's war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/serb-nationalist-leader-on-trial-at.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 at the ICTY after he was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/seslj3rdind071207e.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes and accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict. The trial was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 because of concerns witnesses were being intimidated. The 2-1 ruling came in response to a motion filed by prosecutors in which they <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/trans/en/090115ED.htm">argued</a> [court transcripts] there was "clear and convincing evidence that going forward will compromise the integrity and fairness of the proceedings." The trial resumed in 2010 after the delay, and was again ordered to continue in 2011 after Seselj sought to have the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/cis/en/cis_seselj_en.pdf">charges be dismissed</a> [case sheet, PDF]. The trial is currently ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/103111zor.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in the combined cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1276.htm">Utah Highway Patrol Association v. American Atheists</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Brief-05-31-11-125837.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1297.htm">Davenport v.

Utah <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/my_mission.html">Attorney General Mark Shurtleff</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-memorial-crosses.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court in April, arguing that the lower court improperly applied the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to "passive public displays" and erroneously deemed the memorials "government speech." Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter from the denial of <em>certiorari</em>:<blockquote>Today the Court rejects an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles. A sharply divided Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has declared unconstitutional a private association's efforts to memorialize slain police officers with white roadside crosses, holding that the crosses convey to a reasonable observer that the State of Utah is endorsing Christianity. The Tenth Circuit's opinion is one of the latest in a long line of "'religious display'" decisions that, because of this Court's nebulous Establishment Clause analyses, turn on little more than "judicial predilections." Because our jurisprudence has confounded the lower courts and rendered the constitutionality of displays of religious imagery on government property anyone's guess, I would grant certiorari.</blockquote>The memorials in question, erected in 1998 by the <a href="http://www.utahtrooper.com/">Utah Highway Patrol Association</a> (UHPA) [official website], consist of 14 12-foot-high cross memorials displaying the fallen troopers' name, rank, badge number and the official UPH symbol. The memorials were paid for with private funds, but most were placed on public land.

<p>Also Monday, the court issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1115.pdf"><em>per curiam</em> opinion</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1115.htm">Cavazos v. Smith</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Cavazos-Cert..pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], summarily reversing the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The court found that the appeals court, "substituted its judgment for that of a California jury on the question whether the prosecution's or the defense's expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, calling the court's summary disposition, "a misuse of discretion." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Most of the victims are either unarmed civilians or detainees. HRW interviewed about 61 Tawerghans across the country including 26 people in detention in and around Misrata and 35 displaced residents of Tawergha currently staying in Tripoli, Heisha and Hun. Information from the interviews revealed that the Misrata militia are engaged in alleged terror activities including beating detainees to death, shooting civilians and forcing displacements. The militias are accusing the Tawerghans of committing crimes, such as rape and murder, with Gaddafi forces during their siege of Misrata, especially in March and May. Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/middle-east/n-africa">Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], stressed the importance of rule of law:<blockquote>Revenge against the people from Tawergha, whatever the accusations against them, undermines the goal of the Libyan revolution. In the new Libya, Tawerghans accused of wrongdoing should be prosecuted based on the law, not subject to vigilante justice... The entire town of Tawergha should not be punished for the crimes of some individuals. Prosecutions of people who committed serious crimes are the way forward, with respect for victims' privacy, not the forced expulsion of the entire town.</blockquote>HRW recommends several measures for Misrata's civil and military leaders in order to establish justice and support the rule of law including punishment of those who harass or attack Tawerghans, clarification of orders to avoid mental and physical abuses during arrests and transfer of detainees to facilities run by the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] in Tripoli or Benghazi.

<p>Last week, the interim Libyan leader <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=7&ParentID=3&LangID=1">Mustafa Abdul-Jalil</a> [official profile] ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-leader-orders-investigation-into-gaddafi-death.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the circumstances surrounding the capture and death of Gaddafi, which raised questions of whether the former leader was killed due to his wounds during the fight or whether he was killed by his own supporters to prevent him from implicating them in any crimes under his regime. On October 20, Gaddafi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">captured and killed</a> [JURIST report] by NTC during its seizure of his hometown, Sirte, marking the latest milestone in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature] that started in February. The Libyan government under the regime of Gaddafi was criticized by the <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] for <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-says-libya-may-be-committing-war-crimes.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the siege of Misrata.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-seven-cases.php">both cases</a> [JURIST report], the court is being asked to determine how poor legal advice from attorneys to clients regarding plea bargaining should impact subsequent guilty verdicts. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-209.pdf">Lafler v. Cooper</a> [transcript, PDF], respondent Anthony Cooper was convicted of assault with intent to murder for shooting a woman in her thigh and buttocks after his attorney advised him to not take a plea offer in the belief that there could be no finding of the requisite intent. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0281n-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the attorney's advice was unconstitutional as it amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. One of the points argued by the state was "that when asserting an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a substantive or procedural right, and this Court has already held that a defendant has no right to a plea bargain."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-444.pdf">Missouri v. Frye</a> [transcript, PDF], respondent Galin Frye was offered two deals by prosecutors during proceedings for driving with a revoked license, but Frye's attorney never informed his client about the offers and Frye pleaded guilty. The Missouri Court of Appeals held that the attorney's failure to inform his client about the plea offers amounted to unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel for the state argued that "Mr. Frye has failed to show prejudice, and therefore his guilty plea remains voluntary, intelligent, and final." Counsel for the US government argued on behalf of petitioners in both cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The blogger is accused of <a href="http://bikyamasr.com/46924/human-rights-groups-condemn-military-trials-for-civillians/">inciting violence during the Bloody Sunday Maspero protests</a> [Bikya Masr report] last month. At the incident, 27 protesters were killed and about 300 were injured. The activist group says that the SCAF has been using military tribunals for Egyptian citizens since taking power in January:<blockquote>On questioning, Abd El Fattah declined to answer the prosecutor's questions, stating that it is illegal and a clear conflict of interest for the military, as a party accused of a crime in the same events, to hold proceedings or adjudicate fairly. He was sent to detention pending further military investigation. As of today we refuse to co-operate with the military prosecution of civilians and we call on all Egyptian citizens to stand with us.</blockquote>The group demands "that Alaa Abd El Fattah be freed immediately, that military trials of civilians be stopped and all those sentenced thus far be released or, at least, retried before civilian courts."

<p>Last month, SCAF created an <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-military-council-issues-ban-on-discrimination.php">amendment</a> that altered election rules to ban the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">use of religious slogans</a> [JURIST reports] in campaigning. The article came ahead of the upcoming November elections and is expected to have an immediate effect on the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=26508">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website] whose traditional slogan "Islam is the solution" was banned under the new electoral guidelines. However, two days later an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report] that prohibited the formation of the Islamic-based political party <a href="http://www.egyig.com/">Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya</a> [party website]. In March, Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-to-lift-state-of-emergency-before-september-election.php">lift the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] before parliamentary polls were to be held. The election announcement came a week after an overwhelming majority of Egyptians voted to approve <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-citizens-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-constitutional-reform.php">several constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] in a national referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> [official website] and other opponents of the immigration law filed suit arguing that the portion of the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/10/31/20111031arizona-immigration-day-labor-challenge.html">law banning day labor is an unconstitutional</a> [AP report] restriction of free speech on those who wish to communicate their need for work. They also assert that the state cannot justify the law by claiming that the customary day laborer practice creates traffic problems because there are existing laws designed to curb such problems. 

<p>This suit is one in a long line of legal challenges to the Arizona law. Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-dismisses-arizona-counterclaim-over-immigration-law.php">dismissed a counterclaim</a> [JURIST report] filed by Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] and state <a href="http://www.azag.gov/bio.html">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official profile] against the US government in the lawsuit challenging the controversial Arizona immigration law. In August, the state of Arizona  <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four of the law's provisions. In a preview of how it might rule should it decide to hear the case, the Supreme Court in May <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-115.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/us-v-sc-complaint.pdf">suit</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/October/11-ag-1429.html">press release</a>] on Monday in the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] to challenge the state's newly adopted <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">immigration law</a> [SB 20 text].  The complaint claims that the new legislation, which allows police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest, and requires businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system, creates a patchwork of state and local immigration policies that conflict with the policies and principles of the federal government. The department is requesting an injunction barring certain portions of the state law that would take effect on January 1. Though the DOJ recognizes that South Carolina's legislation is in response to a broken federal immigration system, the suit maintains that such harsh enforcement laws are <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/31/justice-department-sues-south-carolina-over-states-strict-immigration-law/">preempted by federal law</a> [AP report] and are unconstitutional violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]:<blockquote>In our constitutional system, the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and to conduct foreign relations. ... Although States may exercise their police power in a manner that has an incidental or indirect effect on aliens, a State may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration laws. The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of disparate state and local immigration policies throughout the country.</blockquote>The DOJ claims that South Carolina's laws are similar to those passed by <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a> [JURIST reports], which the federal government has also challenged for their interference with immigration enforcement efforts.

<p>State responses to inadequate federal immigration law continue to create controversy. The South Carolina legislation was recently <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/complaint_final.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] by a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">coalition of civil rights groups</a> [JURIST report], including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and others who claim it invites racial profiling and interferes with federal law. The <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] denied similar motions for injunction against that state's recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">passed immigration law</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, the state of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">controversial immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], on which the South Carolina and Alabama legislation is modeled. Several other state legislatures have also acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/house/house.html">North Carolina House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-passes-bill-requiring-use-of-everify.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in June to pass a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H36v7.pdf">bill</a> [HB 36 text, PDF] requiring all employers with 25 or more employees to check the immigration status of their hires using the E-Verify system. In April, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 64-32 to approve a <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/ES/ES0590.2.html">bill</a> [Amended SB 590 text] considered to be a "watered-down" version of the Arizona bill. <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports] have all approved Arizona-style immigration bills within the past year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egypt's deputy prime minister for political development Ali al-Selmi said that the law would apply to officials who are found guilty of financial crimes and abuse of power <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7A002E20111101">including officials elected to parliament</a> [Reuters report].

Elections for the lower house of parliament are set to begin on November 28.

<p>The SCAF has recently passed a number of new laws and amended preexisting laws. Last month, the SCAF issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-military-council-issues-ban-on-discrimination.php">decree banning discrimination</a> [JURIST report] on the basis of race, gender or religion. The SCAF article, Law Decree No. 125 / 2011, amended Criminal Law provisions first passed in 1937. The new article imposes heavy penalties, amounting to fines of up to EGP 100,000 (USD $16,778) and a prison sentence of up to three months, on civil servants who discriminate against citizens in ways that threaten social justice or equal opportunity or disturb the public peace. Earlier that same month, a similar SCAF amendment <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">altered election rules to ban the use of religious slogans</a> [JURIST report] in campaigning.

The report focuses on Uganda's increasing restrictions against freedom of speech, freedom of press and freedom of assembly and the use of force against citizens and journalists who participate in protests or speak out against the government. It points to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil Rights (ICCR)</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=african%20charter%20on%20human%20and%20peoples%27%20rights&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa-union.org%2Fofficial_documents%2Ftreaties_%2520conventions_%2520protocols%2Fbanjul%2520charter.pdf&ei=6ACwToX7G8Hk0QGbzuzEAQ&usg=AFQjCNFT-ulnv3smvPl5tuN6Y4Yojp3IAA&cad=rja">African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> [text, PDF], to which Uganda is a party. The ICCR and the charter both proclaim that freedom of speech, press and peaceful assembly should be guaranteed to all citizens. The report states that Uganda has been increasingly encroaching on rights to speech since 2007 and that it has violated its citizens' right to peaceful protests by <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/jurist-1.php">responding with violence and arrests</a> [JURIST report] to protests beginning in May and April about the rising costs of living:<blockquote>Government and public officials justify the actions of the police and media regulatory authorities on the basis that freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are not absolute and can be limited in light of public interest. International law is however, very clear that any restrictions on these rights must be exceptional, narrowly defined, only where demonstrably necessary and proportionate for one of the specific purposes recognized as legitimate under international law, and must not place in jeopardy the right itself.</blockquote>The report also expresses concern about the vagueness of Uganda laws, such as the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=uganda%20press%20and%20journalist%20act%20pdf&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrnjuganda.org%2Fpress_ammendment.pdf&ei=vAWwTvvoBqTq0gGe6eDEAQ&usg=AFQjCNFM3-g_4_OawUv32X4iUvlKzwsrLA&cad=rja">Press and Journalist Act</a> [2010 amendments text, PDF], the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/legis/consol_act/pca195087/">Penal Code</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=uganda%20police%20act%20pdf&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CDgQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upf.go.ug%2FReports%2Fpolice%2520Act.pdf&ei=uQewTvaTM4HX0QG38JHfAQ&usg=AFQjCNHBq-DE2ABdIfauO_kbGwuheNBAYQ&cad=rja">Police Act</a> [text, PDF], which AI believes could be used to continue to stifle freedom of press and assembly.

<p>This is not the first time Uganda has been criticized for infringing on its citizens' rights. In May, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called on Uganda to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-uganda-government-for-protest-response.php">stop using violence</a> [JURIST report] against protesters. Pillay also criticized the government at that time for having arrested opposition leader Kizza Beisgye multiple times. In 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] condemned Uganda for the use of <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/rights-group-urges-uganda-to-end.php">torture and unlawful arrests</a> [JURIST report] in anti-terrorism efforts. In 2007, a report released by the <a href="http://www.uhrc.ug/">Uganda Human Rights Commission</a> [official website] showed that 320 Ugandan <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/torture-most-common-rights-abuse.php">citizens had filed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the government for torture. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Zerihoun stated that although recent efforts in the international community have reduced the instances of piracy in the East African region, many nations have failed to prosecute accused pirates. He suggested that Somalia needed support for its own maritime law enforcement. Additionally, Zerihoun explained that action must be taken to deter young Somalis from taking up piracy and argued that attention to the Somalian economy was crucial. Zerihoun's statement followed the Security Council's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">adoption</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10419.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] in October, urging member states to <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/10/security-council-meeting-somalia-5.html">make piracy a crime and establish anti-piracy courts</a> [webcast] due to the rise in maritime piracy crime off the coast of Somalia. The resolution also asks UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to issue a progress report in two months regarding the prosecution of piracy suspects in Somalia. 

<p>International <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] reached an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all-time high</a> [JURIST report] early in the first quarter of 2011, according to a <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/news/441-attacks-off-the-somali-coast-drive-piracy-to-record-high-reports-imb">report</a> [press release] released in April by the <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/home/imb">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website]. Earlier that month, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-security-council-to-consider-special-maritime-piracy-courts.php">unanimously approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to consider creating new laws, courts and prisons specialized to address the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. Last January, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">IMB reported</a> [JURIST report] that, to that point, 2009 marked the worst year of piracy since 2003, spiking near Somalian waters then as well. In July 2009, the IMB reported [JURIST report] that pirate attacks around the globe doubled in the first half of 2009. Few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The memorandum, signed by Yury Fedotov, the executive director of the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) and Antonio Guterres, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official websites] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40267&Cr=&Cr1=">pledged</a> [UN News Centre report] to coordinate the two agencies' resources to better target criminals involved in human trafficking. Speaking at the memorandum signing in New York, Fedotov <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2011/November/unodc-and-unhcr-sign-mou-to-combat-human-trafficking-and-migrant-smuggling.html?ref=fs1">praised</a> [press release] the agreement: <blockquote>UNODC's mandate in combating organized crime is complementary to UNHCR's work of protecting refugees. As we have often seen with human trafficking and migrant smuggling, criminals prey on society's most vulnerable. Refugees, in search of a better life, can become victims of these criminals and it's important that we offer coordinated assistance to those who need it the most.</blockquote> The agreement is intended to accomplish the dual goals of prosecuting human traffickers and providing protection to their victims. Guterres also called on the international community to increase their efforts in fighting global human trafficking.

<p>Human trafficking has become an increasingly scrutinized issue in recent years, both in the US and abroad. In August, the UN Special Rapporteur on human trafficking <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">urged Thailand</a> [JURIST report] to crack down on human trafficking, especially with regard to children subjected to sexual and labor exploitation. In September 2010, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/doj-brings-charges-in-largest-us-human-trafficking-case.php">brought charges</a> [JURIST report] against six people in the largest US case of human trafficking. In June 2010, the UNODC issued a <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/publications/TiP_Europe_EN_LORES.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] that human trafficking is becoming a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/human-trafficking-in-europe.php">major problem in Europe</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/142979.pdf">annual report</a> [text, pdf] on human trafficking, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-state-department-issues-annual-report-on-human-trafficking.php">concluding</a> [JURIST report] that the US has a "serious problem with human trafficking, both for labor and commercial sexual exploitation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

They also published a 645-page report <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Legislative_and_Public_Affairs/Newsroom/Press_Releases/20111031_Press_Release.pdf">assessing the impact of statutory minimum sentences on federal sentencing</a> [press release, PDF], specifically targeting those that the commission finds to be too severe and applied too broadly. The new guidelines, which go into effect Tuesday, are estimated to <a href="http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/11/federal_guidelines_could_reduc.html">reduce the sentences of approximately 12,000 inmates</a> [<em>Birmingham News</em> report] and will address the issue of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prison+and+population">overcrowded prisons systems</a> [JURIST news archive]. With hopes of the changes rendering a more cost effective and sensible justice system, each case will be reviewed and ultimately presented to a judge for a final determination, who may also consider whether the prisoner is a danger to the public. Last year, Congress requested that the USSC adjust their guidelines pertaining to the amount of crack cocaine that would trigger sentencing to be comparable to the amount required for the form of powdered cocaine. The USSC report was also undertaken in light of a 2005 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-sentencing-guideline-changes-do-not-affect-modification-hearings.php">Booker v. United States</a> [JURIST report], which rendered federal sentencing guidelines to be advisory. Federal sentencing guidelines are meant to provide a suggested sentencing range for judges to consider if they choose not to impose the mandatory minimum sentence by considering seriousness of the offense and the defendant's criminal history.  

<p>In June, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] urged the USSC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/holder-calls-for-retroactive-application-of-crack-sentencing-law.php">to apply the Fair Sentencing Act</a> [S 1789 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/a-us-appeals-court-holds-fair-sentencing-act-is-not-retroactive.php">retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. He argued "there is simply no just or logical reason why their punishments should be dramatically more severe than those of other cocaine offenders." Under a law passed in 1986, an individual possessing five grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory five-year prison sentence, while an individual possessing powder cocaine would need to have 100 times that amount to receive the same sentence. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/07/28/us-end-sight-infamous-crack-cocaine-laws">praised</a> [press release] the bill's passage, stating that the old law also created a racial disparity, with African Americans comprising 79.8 percent of all offenders sentenced for crack cocaine violations. In April 2008, a study released by the USSC reported that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">had their sentences reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. In 2007, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">USSC voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that reduced crack cocaine penalties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICTB, a special court established by the Bangladeshi government and not endorsed by any international organization, also rejected the bail petitions of JI chief Motiur Rahman Nizami's bail petition, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and assistant secretaries general Mohammad Kamaruzzaman and Abdul Kadar Mollah, who are all in prison. The JI party, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-court-charges-senior-opposition-leader-with-war-crimes-from-1971-war.php">openly campaigned against breaking away</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan during the war, has accused the government-run tribunal of targeting political opponents. Formal <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=210430&cid=2">charges must be submitted</a> [bdnews24.com report] by December 5. 

<p>Earlier this week the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-delayed.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] the start of its first war crimes trial. The ICTB was slated to hear arguments in the case of Delwar Hossain Sayedee, leader of JI. Sayedee's lawyer asked the tribunal to review the charges against his client. The tribunal accepted 20 of 31 charges including allegations of aiding Pakistani soldiers, committing murder and rape, torching villages, looting and forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. Sayedee has denied the charges. The trial is scheduled to resume on November 20. In July, Bangladeshi prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bangladesh-prosecutors-charge-islamic-leader-with-war-crimes.php">filed the underlying war crime charges</a> [JURIST reports] in the ICTB against Sayedee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UN experts are concerned about reports of heavy security measures surrounding the Kirti monastery, which houses approximately 2,500 Buddhist monks. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/FreedomReligionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief</a> [official website] Heiner Bielefeldt stated: <blockquote>Intimidation of the lay and monastic community must be avoided, and the right of members of the monastic community and the wider community to freely practice their religion, should be fully respected by the Chinese Government. Restrictive measures not only curtail the right to freedom of religion or belief, but further exacerbate the existing tensions and are counterproductive.</blockquote>These alleged security forces include officers in riot gear, soldiers with automatic rifles, trucks with armed personnel on the streets to the monastery, security raids, surveillance within monasteries and police presence both inside and outside of the monasteries to monitor religious activities. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression</a> [official website] Frank La Rue voiced his concern over allegations of restricted internet access and mobile service as well as the lack of access for journalists to the area. La Rue recommended that the Chinese government "listen to and address the legitimate grievances of the monastic community" instead of taking reported security measures.

<p>China's human rights record has been widely criticized. In June, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/DisappearancesIndex.aspx">Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances</a> [official website], another party to Tuesday's statement, urged <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-demands-china-report-on-missing-persons.php">China to address its practice of "enforced disappearances"</a> [JURIST report] and reveal the location of 355 detained Tibetan monks. Earlier in June, the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] urged <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">China to release protestors</a> [JURIST report] arrested during peaceful protests in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] in June 1989. Rights groups marked the twentieth anniversary in 2009 and called for the government to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-advocates-urge-reform-on-20th.php">investigate the incident</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Chinese rights activist and Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>].

In particular, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/November11/alliedhomemortgagepr.pdf">claims</a> [press release, PDF] that Allied engaged in "reckless" lending practices, including a decade-long period of operating "shadow branches," lying about its compliance with regulations set forth by the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD">US Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) [official website] and concealing misconduct that has resulted in the default of nearly 32 percent of the 112,324 loans which the firm originated between 2001 and 2010. Such conduct has allegedly caused HUD more than $834 million in insurance claims already paid, and because the government expects additional claims to follow, the US has requested treble damages and penalties under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/31C37.txt">False Claims Act</a> [text] for at least $2 billion. US Attorney for Manhattan Preet Bharara has publicly denounced the firm's alleged practices:<blockquote>Allied and its CEO exploited a government insurance program to engage in a wholesale shifting of risk away from itself&#8212;playing a lending industry equivalent of heads-I-win and tails-you-lose. The losers here were American taxpayers and the thousands of families who faced foreclosure because they could not ultimately fulfill their obligations on mortgages that were deemed to fail.</blockquote>Allied has yet to respond to the government's allegations.

<p>Only six months ago, Bharara filed a <a href="http://4closurefraud.org/2011/05/03/complaint-united-state-of-america-vs-deutsche-bank-and-mortgageit-inc/">civil suit</a> [complaint] in the SDNY against <a href="http://www.db.com/index_e.htm">Deutsche Bank</a> [corporate website] for also <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-files-suit-against-deutsche-bank-alleging-mortgage-fraud.php">allegedly engaging in mortgage fraud</a> [JURIST report]. Similar to the government's current claim, the complaint against Deutsche Bank in May 2011 averred that, from 1999-2009, the bank regularly lied to the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/federal_housing_administration">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA) [official website] in order to obtain and maintain the Direct Endorsement Lender (DEL) status of its subsidiary, MorgageIT. The US argued that during the time this subsidiary acted as a DEL, it endorsed more than 39,000 mortgages for FHA insurance while failing to not only adhere to the program's edibility rules, but also failing to implement quality control procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST press release] <a href="/">JURIST Legal News and Research Services, Inc.</a> is pleased to announce the appointment of Matthew Shames as Executive Director. In this role, Mr. Shames will oversee JURIST's business and development efforts, including outreach and educational initiatives, fundraising, and corporate management.

<p>"Matt brings to JURIST a unique combination of legal, managerial, entrepreneurial and technical experience, as well as longtime familiarity with and dedication to JURIST's public service mission," said Bernard Hibbitts, JURIST's Chairman of the Board and Professor of Law at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

I know Matt's energy and creativity will have a tremendously positive impact on JURIST in the months and years to come as he focuses on building JURIST's institutional base and expanding our capacity to serve a large national and international audience."</p>

<p>Prior to joining JURIST, Mr. Shames worked as a transactional attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll &#38; Rooney, PC and Cohen &#38; Grigsby, PC During this time, Mr. Shames focused his practice on commercial real estate development, commercial lending, emerging businesses and general corporate counseling.</p>

<p>Mr. Shames earned his JD from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 2005. While in law school, Mr. Shames served as Editor-in-Chief of the University of Pittsburgh Law Review. Additionally, as one of the then-handful of JURIST student staffers, Mr. Shames helped develop and prototype JURIST's Paper Chase legal news operation and was instrumental in recruiting the first class of JURIST student news anchors for what has since become JURIST's flagship service. He also received a Bachelor of Arts (American Civilization major, English minor) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990.</p>

<p>Prior to attending law school, Mr. Shames worked for eight years in the high-technology sector in several roles, including as a programmer, project manager and consultant. Mr. Shames co-founded and served as vice-president of Interactive Ensemble, Inc., a web application development company that was based in Austin, Texas, from 1997-2001.</p>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-788.pdf">Rehberg v. Paulk</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-to-examine-whether-death-penalty-appeal-can-continue-despite-missed-deadline.php">report</a>], the court considered whether government officials who act as "complaining witnesses" to initiate a prosecution by providing false testimony in a grand jury hearing are immune to civil suits. The government argued that a government agent is entitled to qualified immunity and that it is well accepted that prosecution may go forward initially based on false testimony. Respondents argued that, under  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12074975541007910866&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Malley v.

The court wrestled both with what types of evidence were acceptable as well as the definition of a "complaining witness" in federal criminal trial.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1104.pdf">Minneci v. Pollard</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-to-rule-on-claim-against-private-prison-contractors.php">report</a>], the court will determine whether federal inmates may sue employees of private prisons where the plaintiff has adequate alternative remedies in state court and defendants have no employment or contractual relationship with the government. The court appeared to be strongly convinced by the government-petitioner's argument that <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text] should continue to be used as a last resort and not expanded when state law provides adequate redress: "Over the last 3 decades, the Court has made clear that <span class = "casename">Bivens</span> remedies are disfavored and will only be authorized in narrow situations where there are no adequate alternative means for redressing a plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels hesitation. Respondent has satisfied neither criteria. He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and Petitioners' status as employees of a private contractor rather than the government at a minimum gives rise to factors counseling hesitation." Respondents argued that <span class = "casename">Bivens</span> casts a wide net and allows any specific civil action that is not delineated by that state's law, whereas several justices argued with the attorney that almost any action could be addressed by state tort law. Respondent also suggested that as his client was a federal prisoner prosecuted by the federal government, with only access to federal law in the prison library, he should be allowed to address his claims in federal court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter, authored by Assistant Attorney General <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/aag/">Thomas Perez</a> [official website], was sent because of the potential of the state's controversial <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 56 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alabama+immigration">news archive</a>] to "chill or discourage student participation in, or lead to the exclusion of school-age children from, public education programs based on their or their parents' race, national origin, or actual or perceived immigration status." Such an effect may constitute a violation of the federal law prohibiting discrimination against public school students on the basis of race, color or national origin. As a result, the DOJ is requesting that each district submit a list of all enrolled students as well as the number and percentage of students who have withdrawn from school during the current academic year and their race, national origin and English Language Learner (ELL) status. The districts have until November 14 to comply with the DOJ requests. 

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] portions of the law, including Section 28, which requires immigration status checks of public school students, and Section 10, which makes it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. The ruling came in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">motion filed</a> [JURIST report] by the DOJ and a coalition of immigrants rights groups after a judge for the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official websites] twice <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] from taking effect. The DOJ argues that the "state regime contravenes the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration." Alabama state officials have <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">defended the law</a> [JURIST report] and argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law and that the text reflects a "spirit of cooperation with the federal government." The state officials point out that the law contains mechanisms safeguarding against unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and allegations suggesting provisions of the law would deter students from enrolling in school are speculative. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Two of the men were also convicted of plotting to destroy the Sears tower in Chicago and FBI offices around the US. The court rejected the six arguments made by the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8371671.stm">convicted ringleader Narseal Batiste</a> [BBC report] and the other defendants, including challenges to the sufficiency of evidence presented during trial, due process violations, admissibility of witness testimony and limitations on cross-examination of witnesses. The men were <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/seven-indicted-for-alleged-terror.php">arrested in 2006</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/terrorism/usbatiste62206ind.html">charged</a> [indictment] with conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda; conspiring to provide material support, training, and resources to terrorists; conspiring to maliciously damage and destroy by means of an explosive; and conspiring to levy war against the government of the US. The district court convicted five of the men after two mistrials and after two of the suspects were acquitted and released. One of the acquitted men was <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/20/2026227/acquitted-haitian-defendant-in.html">deported</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] to his native country of Haiti. The appellate court sentenced Batiste to 13 years imprisonment, while the other four men received prison sentences of six to nine years. 

<p>The Eleventh Circuit's decision is the latest example of US and Canadian efforts to foil terrorist plots and hold conspirators accountable. The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] declared in June that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-high-court-to-hear-terror-suspect-appeal.php">hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the case of Mohammed Momin Khawaja, who was arrested in 2004 in Canada and found guilty of participating in a terrorist group, instructing a person to finance terrorism, making property available to terrorists, contributing to a terrorist group and facilitating terrorism. Also in June, a US federal jury acquitted <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-jury-convicts-terror-suspect-acquits-on-mumbai-terror-attacks.php">Tahawwur Hussain Rana</a> [JURIST report], a Chicago resident with Canadian citizenship, of participating in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks but convicted him on two counts of planning to attack a Copenhagen newspaper. One of the witnesses at Rana's trial, US citizen and Chicago resident David Headley had <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/mumbai-terror-suspect-pleads-guilty-in.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to 12 counts of federal terrorism stemming from the Mumbai terror attacks and a terror incident in Copenhagen. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] in June defended his plans to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ag-holder-defends-prosecuting-terror-suspects-in-civilian-courts.php">prosecute terror suspects in federal civilian courts</a> after consistently <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">advocating</a> [JURIST reports] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts, despite a lack of support from Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2011/11/01/17/45/l0ijo.So.56.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] directed to the attention of the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, the attorneys cited the problems they face in carrying out their duties as a result of the government's detention policy and conditions. Specifically, they allege that those working with the <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/">Joint Task Force Guantanamo</a> (JTF-GTMO) [official website] seize, open, interpret, read and review attorney-client privileged communications, actions which the attorneys argue, are unlawful. As a result of this practice by the JTF-GTMO, the attorneys find themselves in "an untenable position of having either to violate professional ethical standards in order to communicate with our clients, or cease communicating with our clients," and accordingly request that this practice be stopped immediately. Additionally, the attorneys, who <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/01/2482605/military-lawyers-challenge-new.html#storylink=misearch">represent six "high value detainees"</a> [AP report], address the refusal up to this point of the government to respond to their complaints or requests in spite of sending "multiple communications."

<p>While attorneys representing detainees may face challenges in carrying out their duties, prosecutions of those detainees continue. In October, Retired Vice Admiral <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] notified both prosecution and defense lawyers in the trial of five detainees held at Guantanamo Bay that he will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/guantanamo-military-commissions-on-hold-until-new-year.php">accepting recommendations</a> [JURIST report] until early 2012 on whether the trial should move forward as a death penalty case. MacDonald, who was appointed to oversee the military commissions at Guantanamo in 2010, alerted lawyers in the case that they will have until January 15, 2012, to make their recommendations, ensuring that the case will not go to trial at the naval base <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/10/03/2437082/no-911-trial-this-year-at-guantanamo.html">until sometime next year</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report]. The five detainees have been held at Guantanamo since 2006 when they were transferred there from the custody of the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. The government alleges the men were organizers of the<a href="/currentawareness/911.php"> 9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] terrorist attacks, financing and training the men who hijacked the aircrafts used in the attack. MacDonald's communication to counsel also indicates that he will be accepting recommendations in order to determine whether to try the defendants together or separately.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chairman of the <a href="http://www.elections.gov.eg/en/html/home.htm">High Commission for Elections</a> [official website], Judge Abdel Moaz Ibrahim, <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/25763/Egypt/Politics-/Electoral-commission-issues-suggestions-on-how-Egy.aspx">suggested amending Article 39</a> [Al Ahram report] of the constitutional declaration to allow for voting at embassies and consulates to be supervised by diplomats instead of judges. The announcement comes after last week's Administrative Court ruling that Egyptians living abroad must be allowed to vote. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by a group of Egyptian expatriates, including famous Egyptian writer and activist <a href="http://www.ahdafsoueif.com/index.htm">Ahdaf Soueif</a> [personal website] against the High Commissioner of Elections, the <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/Cabinet/Prime_Minister.aspx">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Minister of the Interior</a> [official websites]. Raafat Roheim, a New York-based Egyptian activist said that after the ousting of president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive] in January, interest in voting amongst Egyptian expats began to swell. Egyptians will begin voting on November 28 in the first elections held since the end of Mubarak's 30-year reign.

<p>The country's upcoming election has resulted in a variety of legislative and court activity. Earlier this week, Egypt's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] announced that they will soon ratify a law that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-military-council-to-ratify-anti-corruption-law.php">bans anyone found guilty of corruption</a> [JURIST report] from participating in politics. The law has been criticized for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-political-corruption-law-amendments-have-potential-for-abuse-hrw.php">potential for abuse</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report] that prohibited presidential hopeful <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4558054.stm">Ayman Nour</a> [BBC profile] from forming a political party and also prohibited the formation of the Islamic-based political party <a href="http://www.egyig.com/">Al-Gama'a al-Islamiya</a> [party website]. The decision will allow political parties previously banned because of their religious foundations to participate in the upcoming November parliamentary elections. The SCAF recently amended election rules to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">ban the use of religious slogans in campaigning</a> [JURIST report], stating that "[e]lectoral campaigns based on the use of religious slogans or on racial or gender segregation are banned," and adding that violators could be fined and face up to three months in jail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Mahmoudi has been held in Tunisia since September when he was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/09/libya-ex-pm-arrested-in-tunisia.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] while attempting to illegally enter Tunisia. Reports indicate that al-Mahmoudi <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hVxFmQ2cOXCGwGVbFl_n0rNVMsaA?docId=CNG.6adedd81ea59b1fa76e3b45089c8dace.451">fears for his safety</a> [AFP report] and claims to be the sole possessor of Libyan state secrets following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">death</a> [JURIST report] of ousted Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] in October.

<p>This report comes as the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] appears to be drawing to a close after the interim Libyan prime minister declared the country's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">liberation</a> [JURIST report] following Gaddafi's death. There have been numerous efforts by Libyan and international courts to investigate various members of the Gaddafi regime. Earlier in the summer, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi for crimes against humanity, although some commentators suggested that Gaddafi <a href="/forum/2011/09/charles-adeogun-phillips-libya.php">should face trial in Libya</a> [JURIST op-ed].

Irving Picard, who was designated by the court in 2008 as <a href="http://www.madoff.com/News.aspx">trustee</a> [official website] of the assets seized from the Ponzi scheme, had filed suit against <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.</a> [corporate website] to recover damages for the victims of Madoff's fraud. In her ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that Picard did not have a case because he represented Madoff and not the victims. She held that there was no legal indication that Picard had a right to bring a claim for the victims:<blockquote>Practically, giving the Trustee the power to pursue the claims on behalf of creditors would usurp the creditors' right to determine whether and in what forum to vindicate their legal injuries and would raise difficult issues of preclusion. Moreover, were the Trustee empowered to pursue the claims of third party creditors, the debtor's assets would be depleted to enforce rights possessed by third parties and defendants would face the danger of duplicative recoveries.</blockquote> McMahon also cited a ruling from earlier this year, where Judge Jed Rakoff <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18079616256181220542&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">dismissed</a> [opinion] a case against <a href="http://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/3/personal?home=personal&code=PPG0011159&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=HBUS_PPG0011159">HSBC Holdings</a> [corporate website]. In that case, Rakoff held that Picard could not bring the claim, because he had no "personal stake in the outcome of the controversy." Picard plans to appeal McMahon's decision. 

<p>The first payouts to Madoff's victims were <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the court in July. Picard <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">filed almost 60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010, including the suits against JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. Judge Louis Stanton <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff/trusteeorder.pdf">made Picard the trustee</a> [order] of Bernard L. Madoff Securities, LLC in December 2008. Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison for securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud in March 2009. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Boljkovac, 89, was arrested near his home in Karlovac in connection with the deaths of fascist soldiers and sympathizers post World War II. The investigation against Boljkovac involves <a href="http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2011&mm=11&dd=02&nav_id=554338">alleged executions</a> [B92 report, in Croatian] of at least 30,000 Utasha (fascist) troops at camp Dubovac, where he was commander. Zagreb County Court judge <a href="http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2011-11-02/22936/'Communist_crimes'_suspect_Boljkovac_arrested">ordered him taken into custody</a> [<em>Croatian Times</em> report] due to the particularly grave circumstances of the charge, which was announced in August. Boljkovac denies committing any crime, and no hearing date has been set. Boljkovac was a secret police official under the Communist party, who became Croatia's first interior minister under Josip Broz Tito in 1991 following Croatia's independence. During the time of the alleged crimes, Boljkovac was helping to form the <a href="http://www.hdz.hr/">Croatian Democratic Union</a> (HDZ) [party website, in Croatian], and many claim the charges are politically motivated. Croatia is close to becoming an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-to-join-european-union-in-2013.php">official member</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] in 2013, and a former government official stated that the country must be strong, mature and without exception bring justice to anyone who has ever committed a war crime.

<p>In June, Croatian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-indicts-former-interior-minister-for-war-crimes.php">charged Tomislav Mercep</a> [JURIST report], another former military commander and interior minister, for war crimes committed during the conflict in the Balkans during the 1990s. The day before Mercep's <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/top-croatia-official-arrested-for-war-crimes.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes. Last November, six men were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/croatia-court-sentences-6-men-for-2008-death-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to prison terms for their roles in the 2008 killing of a Croatian journalist. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, noting that the courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ITCY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTY">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area. The entry talks resumed in October 2005 after the ICTY declared Croatia was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/icty-says-croatia-now-cooperating-on.php">fully cooperating</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court will be the first post-Cold War international tribunal to conclude its mandate and has prosecuted eight of those who committed serious violation of international humanitarian law during the conflict in Sierra Leone that started in 1991 and lasted for 11 years. In its report, the OSJI highlighted seven key issues that need urgent attention by the Sierra Leone government, the SCSL, the UN, the Sierra Leone civil society and legal organizations, the donors, and the SCSL Management Committee over the next six months before the court closes:<blockquote>The closure of the SCSL represents the international community's first opportunity to implement an appropriate exit strategy for international justice. This process will be observed by the other international courts due to close in the next few years: the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts of Cambodia. The proper closing of the SCSL is the only way to guarantee the investment in justice in Sierra Leone is realized. The Sierra Leonean government, the UN, the SCSL, the court's donors, and Sierra Leonean civil society and legal organizations must act quickly to safeguard the court's legacy.</blockquote> Even though the final judgment of Taylor is expected in late 2011, if an appeal can be taken, the appellate judgment could then be expected in mid-2012 and with it the closure of the SCSL.

<p>In June, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-indicts-five-for-witness-tampering.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] five people on contempt charges for witnesses tampering. Two of the indictees were former leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), Ibrahim Bazzy Kamara and Santigie Borbor Kanu, who were <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by SCSL in June 2007. Their trial <a href="/thisday/2011/03/scsl-began-trial-of-junta-leaders.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in March 2005. In 2007, the SCSL charged Charles Taylor with <a href="'http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">11 counts</a> [indictment, PDF] of war crimes and crimes against humanity, all of which he <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied</a> [JURIST report].

The former Soviet air force officer was convicted by the jury after a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/nyregion/viktor-bout-guilty-in-arms-trafficking-case.html">three-week trial</a> [NYT report] and only two days of deliberation. Bout's lawyers did not call witnesses but asserted that Bout, who never provided money or arms to the informants, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/02/viktour-bout-convicted-arms-deal">feigned his willingness to sell arms</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in order to make a deal to sell two cargo planes. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15565305">Scheduled for sentencing in February</a> [BBC report], Bout faces up to life in prison.

<p>Last November, Bout <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/russia-arms-dealer-pleads-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded not guilty</a> days after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/thailand-extradites-accused-russian-arms-dealer-to-us.php">Thai government extradited</a> [JURIST reports] him to the US to stand trail. In October, Bout <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/accused-russia-arms-dealer-appeals-us-extradition-in-thailand-court.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging the Bangkok Criminal Court's <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/thailand-court-dismisses-charges-against-suspected-russia-arms-dealer.php">decision to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] money laundering and fraud charges against him, which removed obstacles to his US extradition. According to Bout's lawyer Lak Nitiwatanavichan, the arms dealer was <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/200469/lawyer-appeals-dropping-of-charges-against-bout">seeking to have these charges reinstated</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] to avoid extradition to the US. In August, an appeals court in Thailand ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-court-approves-us-extradition-of-suspected-russia-arms-dealer.php">Bout could be extradited</a> [JURIST report] to the US. The court's ruling overturned a decision it issued a year earlier, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/thailand-court-refuses-extradition-to.php">refusing to extradite Bout</a> [JURIST report] on the basis that the accusations made by the US were not cognizable under Thai law.  Bout was the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/02/us-usa-crime-bout-idUSTRE7A16CT20111102">subject of the book "Merchant of Death"</a> [Reuters report], which inspired a movie by the same name, and is suspected of involvement in arms trafficking to conflict zones in Africa, South America and Middle East since the 1990s. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-8974.pdf">Perry v. New Hampshire</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rejects-conrad-black-appeal.php">report</a>], the court considered whether the due process protections against unreliable identification evidence apply to all identifications or only when the suggestive circumstances were orchestrated by the police. The petitioner was convicted based in part on an eyewitness identification made while he was in handcuffs, albeit not orchestrated by the police. The petitioner argued that it was fundamentally unfair to allow potentially erroneous eyewitness identifications into the trial simply because they were not orchestrated by police. New Hampshire, supported by the Solicitor General as <em>amicus curiae</em>, argued that the rules of evidence provided sufficient safeguards and that cases where the erroneous identifications were disallowed were aimed at deterring police misconduct, which no one has alleged in the case at hand. In addition, the government urged it is the primary role of the jury to assess the reliability of evidence and handing that determination to the judge would be a fundamental shift in our trial practice. The court questioned whether the role of these due process protections was strictly deterrence or whether it also included prevention of injustice, as urged by petitioner.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-895.pdf">Gonzalez v. Thaler</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-upholds-gender-discrimination-ruling-takes-4-more-cases.php">report</a>], the court considered when jurisdiction exists pursuant to a certificate of appealability issued under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002253----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2253(c)</a> [text] to adjudicate a petitioner's appeal and when time runs out for <em>habeas corpus</em> review under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002244----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2244(d)(1)</a> [text]. Petitioner argued that a certificate of appealability (COA) that does not fully comply with all the requirements of the statute, nonetheless confers jurisdiction on the federal appeals court. Petitioner also argued that the one-year statute of limitations for federal <em>habeas corpus</em> review should not begin until the ruling is final according to State law, as opposed to a uniform federally-imposed definition of a final ruling. The state argued that, because the COA was incomplete due to the district court judge's error, it did not meet the requirements of the statute and, therefore, did not confer jurisdiction on the appeals court. The state also argued that the statute provides a two-prong to determine with the clock starts to run and that, even where that might start the clock running before state <em>habeas corpus</em> review becomes available, the clock should start nonetheless. The state noted the circumstances of this care occur only rarely and, in any event, the stay-and-abeyance procedure used in <span class="casename">Rhines</span> would resolve the issue, and should have been employed in this case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Reyes, Al-Nashiri's defense attorney, argued that Al-Nashiri's inevitable indefinite detention <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/guantanamo-prisoners-lawyer-raises-challenge-to-tribunals.php">renders his trial merely a show</a> [JURIST report] that lacks meaningful reprieve, and that jurors have the right to be informed that they are simply playing a role in a pre-determined political decision. Prosecutors have responded that the tribunal's jurisdiction over the fate of the accused has always been limited and that a jury's potential to find Al-Nashiri guilty and ultimately <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/02/2484466/prosecutor-guantanamo-court-cant.html">sentence him to death for war crimes</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] is an issue separate from governmental authority to keep enemy combatants off the battlefield. Al-Nashiri's arraignment, scheduled for November 9, will be the first time has has appeared in public since his capture in 2002 after a series of transfers among CIA prison systems. Al-Nashiri will also be the first Guantanamo prisoner to face a possible death sentence.  

<p>Al-Nashiri, the alleged plotter of the USS Cole bombing, has been at the center of controversy for many years. In May, lawyers for al-Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">filed suit against Poland</a> [JURIST report] over his <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=secret+CIA+prison">supposed torture in a secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in the country. In 2007, al-Nashiri declared that his confession to orchestrating the USS Cole bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-says-torture.php">elicited under torture</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Nashiri, along with fellow militant Jamal al-Badawi [FBI backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/yemeni-court-upholds-death-sentence-in.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] by a Yemeni court in 2004 for his role in the attack on the Cole.

The $550,000 fine was issued as a result of the Janet Jackson "wardrobe malfunction" during the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl. The Third Circuit issued a similar ruling on the case in 2008, but that case was sent back by the Supreme Court in May 2009 after it <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-582.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on a similar case. In the opinion issued Wednesday, the court reaffirmed the reasoning behind its first opinion, which found that the FCC could not levy the fine because that would represent a retroactive shift in policy:<blockquote>The Commission's exception for fleeting material under that regulatory scheme likewise treated images and words alike. Three decades of FCC action support this conclusion. Accordingly, we find the FCC's conclusion on this issue, even as an interpretation of its own policies and precedent, counter to the evidence before the agency and so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.</blockquote>CBS said they were happy with the outcome. The biggest supporter of the fine, the <a href="http://www.parentstv.org/">Parents Television Council</a> [advocacy website], called the ruling an act of <a href="http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/release/2011/1102.asp">"judicial stupidity"</a> [press release] and "a sucker punch to families everywhere."

<p>The $550,000 fine was <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/fcc-fines-cbs-record-550000-over-janet.php">directed</a> [JURIST report] at CBS and 20 affiliates in September 2004 as a result of the broadcast. CBS <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/cbs-appeals-fcc-super-bowl-indecency.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the fine in July 2006. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-orders-third-circuit-to.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] the case to the Third Circuit in May 2009 for reconsideration in light of its decision in <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-upholds-fcc-ban-on.php">FCC v. Fox Television Stations</a> [JURIST report]. This is also not the only issue CBS has had with the FCC. In March 2006 the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/fcc-proposes-record-36m-fine-against.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] a record $3.6 million fine for indecency violations against CBS and its affiliates as a result of the network airing a graphic sex scene on one of its shows. </p>]]></content:encoded>

North Dakota's <a href="http://www.ag.nd.gov/documents/NGEAComplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against its neighbor state seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against provisions of Minnesota's <a href="http://www.nextstep.state.mn.us/res_detail.cfm?id=4034">Next Generation Energy Act of 2007</a> (NGEA) [materials], which prohibits "the importation into [the state] of power from any 'new large energy facility' that 'would contribute to statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions,'" and the creation of any subsequent purchase agreements. The suit charges Minnesota officials with regulating beyond state borders and so interfering with the free flow of goods and service in an unconstitutional contravention of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [LII backgrounder]:<blockquote>These prohibitions on the importation of power from new large energy facilities from outside Minnesota and new long-term power purchase agreements for power generated outside of Minnesota imposed by the NGEA are facially discriminatory and have been discriminatory as applied. . . . In practical effect, through the implementation and application of these statutes, Defendants have subjected energy projects located outside of Minnesota and/or in which Minnesota-based entities have no interests to onerous regulatory burdens.</blockquote>North Dakota <a href="http://www.ag.nd.gov/">Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ag.nd.gov/documents/11-02-11.pdf">faulted</a> [press release, PDF] Minnesota <a href="http://mn.gov/governor/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> for the necessity of the lawsuit, as earlier this year Dayton vetoed a successful bi-partisan move in the <a href="http://www.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Legislature</a> [official websites] to repeal the NGEA. The vetoed measure was passed after four years of lobbying by North Dakota. North Dakota power plants export most of their generated power to other states, including Minnesota.

<p>Power stations in Minnesota generate approximately sixty percent of their electricity from coal, all of which is imported, and Minnesota imports electricity directly from other states like North Dakota. The NGEA was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/new-us-state-laws-take-effect-with.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by former governor Tim Pawlenty, and was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while promoting renewable energy sources and greater energy efficiency. Such measures have traditionally met strong resistance from existing electricity producers and other industries and areas of business, as legislation of this kind is often accompanied by increased energy costs. Last month a federal court ruled that the US is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-rules-government-not-required-to-reduce-emissions-to-protect-polar-bear.php">not required to reduce emissions</a> [JURIST report] to protect polar bears. That decision was handed down about a week after another federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-rules-against-epa-coal-permit-regulations.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] regarding stricter guidelines passed in 2009 for its process of granting permits used by coal companies for mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia. In September the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/house-passes-bill-requiring-analysis-of-proposed-epa-regulations.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would effectively block a number of proposed EPA regulations aimed at reducing emissions. Earlier in September, President Obama requested the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/obama-overturns-epa-smog-standards.php">withdrawal of national smog standards</a> [JURIST report] proposed by the EPA. The stricter smog standards, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/epa-proposes-stricter-smog-regulations.php">proposed by the EPA in January 2010</a> [JURIST report], would have replaced the Bush administration's broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. In his statement, Obama recognized recent efforts to improve environmental protection, but emphasized the need to trim down regulations in light of the economic downturn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sanader <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE7A225L20111103?sp=true">stands accused</a> [Reuters report] of corruption, abuse of power and fraud for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">taking nearly &#8364;4 million</a> [JURIST report] from public firms and state institutions, charges which he has denied. Croatia's Bureau for Combating Corruption and Organized Crime (USKOK) alleged <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">Sanader received a pay-off</a> [JURIST report] of more than 3.6 million kuna (nearly USD $695,000) from Austria's Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank in exchange for the country entering into a loan agreement to receive 140 million Austrian Schillings (USD $14.7 million) in order to place the bank in the Croatian market. At the time Sanader was deputy foreign minister and Croatia was at war, fighting for independence from Yugoslavia. In pleading not guilty Sanader told the court that he was only an agent for the foreign ministry during talks with Hypo Bank. To underscore his claims, Sanader told the court that Austrian prosecutors investigating malpractice at Hypo Bank had called him as a witness and not as a suspect. Sanader has also been indicted for allegedly taking bribes worth &#8364;10 million from Hungarian energy group <a href="http://www.mol.hu/en/">MOL</a> in exchange for allowing MOL a dominant position in Croatia's oil and gas group <a href="http://www.ina.hr/default.aspx?id=240">INA</a> [corporate websites]. The court's decision on that indictment is still pending.

<p>Sanader's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/trial-postponed-for-former-croatia-pm.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] last week for health reasons. Elected to parliament after he stepped down from the prime minister position in 2009, Sanader was indicted in September as part of an anti-corruption campaign launched his hand-picked successor <a href="http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/clanovi_vlade/jadranka_kosor_dipl_iur">Jadranka Kosor</a> [official profile]. Croatia is close to achieving membership in the European Union (EU), and Kosor hopes Sanader's trial will help ease pressure from Brussels for Croatia to sort out corruption and speed investigations. Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/Austria-extradites-Croatia-ex-PM-to-face-corruption-charges.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to Croatia in July in order to face these charges after he was arrested in Austria last December. Sanader had argued that it would be impossible to receive a fair trial in Croatia, but he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">dropped his stance after media speculation</a> [JURIST report] suggested the appeal could harm EU Croatia's accession. The Kosor government completed accession talks with the EU in June, and is hoping to join in July 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2011cv1600-28">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [opinion, PDF] a suit by <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</a> [corporate website] to block the merger of <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&#38;T</a> and <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/">T-Mobile USA</a> [corporate websites]. AT&#38;T and T-Mobile argued that Sprint failed to properly allege that the merger would cause it "antitrust injury," thus it lacked standing to challenge the merger under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000026----000-.html">15 USC &#167; 16</a> [text]. However, Judge Ellen Huvelle held that Sprint had stated a plausible claim that the merger would cause it injury in the market for acquiring mobile devices. The judge also allowed <a href="http://www.cspire.com/">C Spire</a> [corporate website], co-plaintiff with Sprint, to pursue a claim against the merger that it would negatively impact its roaming services. However, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' remaining complaints that the merger would hurt them in the market for wireless spectrum and network development, as well as the market for backhaul, which is the "physical infrastructure ... that connects cell sites to the wireline network to which wireless calls are routed." Both sides stated that they were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/02/att-sprint-idUSN1E7A11UQ20111102">pleased with the ruling</a> [Reuters report]. Sprint was happy that the judge allowed the case to go forward whereas AT&#38;T was happy that several of Sprint's claims were dismissed.

<p>Sprint is not the only entity attempting to block the merger of AT&#38;T and T-Mobile. In August the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-files-antitrust-suit-to-block-att-t-mobile-merger.php">filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger</a> [JURIST report] and a month later <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/seven-states-join-doj-lawsuit-opposing-att-t-mobile-merger.php">seven states joined</a> [JURIST report] the DOJ's suit. The government argued that "AT&#38;T's elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market." AT&#38;T responded that acquiring T-Mobile will allow it to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/att-responds-to-doj-antitrust-lawsuit.php">provide better services to its customers</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the expansion of its mobile network and that smaller, regional carriers will still act as alternatives. The worldwide consolidation of media is an ongoing global concern. In August, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple</a> [corporate website] and five major publishers for allegedly colluding to illegally fix electronic book (e-book) prices. Communication Director for Free Press, Dave Saldana <a href="/hotline/2011/07/dave-saldana-news-corp.php">argued last July</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the proposed AT&#38;T/T-Mobile deal is an example of the enormous influence large media corporations can bring to bear through massive public relations blitzes and the acquisition of political influence through the pouring of money into lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. Saldana said that, for these reasons, AT&#38;T remains confident that its T-Mobile purchase will go through, "because it knows it has several hundred million reasons to push for the merger, and millions of means to get it." Saldana warned that media consolidation is dangerous because it gives the companies leverage to sway public opinion and dominate the narrative when their own practices are questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontuae.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A trial observer appointed by a coalition of human rights groups said Thursday that the trial of five pro-democracy activists charged with publicly insulting United Arab Emirates (UAE) leaders has been <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/03/uae-trial-observer-finds-due-process-flaws-uae-5-case">"grossly unfair"</a> [press release] and "has no basis in international law as it violates their freedom of expression." The five men, who have been detained since April, were charged in June under &#167; 176 of the <a href="http://www.dubailaw.com/article/viewarticle.asp?id=87">UAE Penal Code</a> [text] for publicly insulting UAE president Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed and other government officials. Two of the five men are alleged to have used or incited violence on <a href="http://www.uaehewar.net/Forums/">UAE Hewar</a> [official website, in Arabic], an online political forum. Blogger Ahmed Mansoor, one of the five, was also charged with inciting others to break the law, demonstrating and calling for an election boycott. The trial observer stated that "UAE authorities should show a basic commitment to international legal standards, by releasing these men without delay and initiating an independent review of why and how they've been prosecuted on these transparently politicized charges." The trial observer alleges that the defendants have been unable to see all the charges levied against them and have been denied full access to the evidence to be used against them, submissions from the defense are ignored and the prosecution was permitted to give closing arguments despite the fact that the defense had yet to present its entire case and was not allowed to recall prosecution witnesses for cross-examination. Rights courts previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-trial-of-pro-democracy-activists.php">called for the trial to end</a> [JURIST report] in July, but the UAE has nonetheless proceeded with the charges.

<p>Rights groups have criticized the UAE recently for its conduct in the wake of calls for political reform. HRW urged the government of the UAE in April to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-uae-to-reverse-decision-to-dissolve-civil-rights-group.php">reverse its decision to dissolve</a> [JURIST report] the board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights group. HRW was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/09/uae-government-detains-human-rights-defender">critical of the UAE government</a> [press release] when it arrested Mansoor in April for calling for democratic reform. HRW also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/uae-foreign-institutions-should-condemn-crackdown">urged international public institutions</a> [HRW press release] that have a presence in the country, such as the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim</a>, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> and the <a href="http://www.agencefrancemuseums.fr/en/home/">Agence France Museum</a> [official websites], to publicly condemn the UAE government's detention of rights activists. HRW has continued to monitor the UAE's compliance with international human rights standards following a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/united-arab-emirates">2010 report</a> [HRW report] suggesting the human rights climate in the UAE has worsened. HRW has been particularly concerned about torture, the deterioration of conditions for migrant workers, restrictions on freedoms of expression and association, and violations of women's rights. In October 2010, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uae-domestic-violence-ruling-a-violation-of-treaty-obligations-hrw.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a ruling by the UAE Federal Supreme Court affirming a "husband['s] right to discipline his wife" as a violation of UAE treaty obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his statement to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/index.html">UN Security Council</a> [official website], Ocampo gave an update on the events in Libya regarding the ICC investigation. According to the statement, after obtaining the required documents confirming Muammar Gaddafi's death, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099321.pdf">case against him</a> [warrant] will likely be dropped. The statement continued by detailing the cases against <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf">Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, Muammar Gaddafi's son, and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah Al-Senussi</a> [warrants], Libya's head of intelligence, and what is being done to secure their capture. Ocampo went on to discuss a jurisdictional issue involved in the case, saying:<blockquote>The Office was informed that the new Libyan authorities are in the process of preparing a comprehensive strategy to address crimes, including the circumstances surrounding the death of Muammar Gaddafi. In accordance with the Rome Statute the International Criminal Court should not intervene if there are genuine national proceedings. Should  the Libyan authorities decide to prosecute  Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al Sanussi  for the same crimes under investigation by the  International Criminal Court, they should submit an admissibility challenge and it will be for the ICC Judges to decide.</blockquote>This admissibility challenge would be need to be filed under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm">Article 18 Section 7</a> [text] of the Rome Statute. He concluded by saying his office will be prepared to issue a full report on the allegations in May of 2012.

<p>Ocampo's statement comes as the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">conflict in Libya</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is winding down with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of the Gaddafi regime.

The appeal was brought by Canada's attorney general <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1080606--supreme-court-rejects-appeal-in-abdullah-khadr-extradition-case?bn=1">on behalf of the US government</a> [CP report] which sought to extradite Khadr to face charges in the US of <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-11-03/canada-terror-extradition/51061720/1?csp=34news">providing weapons to al Qaeda</a> [AP report] to be used against coalition forces in Afghanistan. The government argued that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g6UxRtbfM8tgZOBBpT4oja6L5s6w?docId=CNG.8f57c81ec428501957d8f35c38e9be85.1e1">extradition was required by international obligations</a> [AFP report]. In line with established practice, the court did not state reasons for refusing to hear the case. Abdullah Khadr is the older brother of <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>], the youngest detainee at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>In May, the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ontario-appeals-court-refuses-to-extradite-terror-suspect-to-us.php">upheld a decision</a> [JURIST report] to halt extradition proceedings for Abdullah Khadr. According to the appeals court, a Toronto judge was right to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/canada-court-orders-release-of-khadr-brother.php">release Abdullah Khadr</a> [JURIST report] last summer because extraditing him to the US would be tantamount to ignoring that he was allegedly subjected to torture in Pakistan at the behest of the US. Abdullah Khadr was detained by Canadian law enforcement in summer 2005 on the basis of a US warrant. In February 2006, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-seeks-extradition-of-indicted.php">formally requested his extradition</a> [JURIST report] from Canada. He was <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-charges-canadian-khadr-brother-with.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 by a US federal grand jury on four counts connected to his alleged procurement of destructive devices to be used against US forces in Afghanistan in 2003 and faces a possible life sentence and a USD $1,000,000 fine. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW pointed to reports that defense counsel and witnesses have been threatened with violence and arrest in order to impede them from participating in the trials. Asia director Brad Adams called for immediate action: "Harassment of defense counsel and witnesses further tarnishes a flawed process. If the Bangladeshi government wants these trials to be taken seriously it must ensure that the rights of the accused are fully respected. That means making sure that lawyers and witnesses don't face threats or coercion."

<p>Earlier this week, the ICTB  <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-formal-charges.php">ordered the prosecution to submit formal charges</a> [JURIST report] against four leaders of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">Jamaat e Islam</a> (JI) who are suspected of war crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders] against Pakistan. Also this week, the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-delayed.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] the start of its first war crimes trial. The ICTB was slated to hear arguments in the case of Delwar Hossain Sayedee, leader of JI. Sayedee's lawyer asked the tribunal to review the charges against his client. The tribunal accepted 20 of 31 charges including allegations of aiding Pakistani soldiers, committing murder and rape, torching villages, looting and forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. Sayedee has denied the charges. The trial is scheduled to resume on November 20. In July, Bangladeshi prosecutors<a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bangladesh-prosecutors-charge-islamic-leader-with-war-crimes.php"> filed the underlying war crime charges</a> [JURIST reports] in the ICTB against Sayedee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

O'Connor <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ohio-death-penalty-procedure-to-be-reviewed.php">announced the formation of the committee</a> [JURIST report] in September, stating that it would be responsible for ensuring that the law is "administered in the most fair, efficient, and judicious manner possible." The committee, a joint task force between the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default.asp">Supreme Court of Ohio</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohiobar.org/Pages/PublicSite.aspx">Ohio State Bar Association</a> [official websites], is being chaired by Retired Judge James Brogan of the Ohio Second District Court of Appeals and includes judges, prosecuting attorneys, criminal defense counsel, legislators and academics. During the committee's opening meeting Brogan questioned the application of the death penalty law, citing prosecutorial discretion in seeking the death penalty and the role economics could play in the decision making process. Brogan also indicated that the committee would address whether the standard of proof should be heightened to a "beyond all doubt" standard in death penalty cases as opposed to the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard used in other criminal cases. The committee will be reviewing death penalty laws and procedures from other jurisdictions and analyzing the data and costs associated with those laws. They will also review information included in the American Bar Association's <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/individual_rights/projects/death_penalty_moratorium_implementation_project.html">Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project</a> [materials] in order to "identify areas in need of action and recommend the course of action." Based upon their findings, the committee will develop a comprehensive set of recommendations, and present their proposals next year to the state for consideration. 

<p>Ohio is currently under an <a href="http://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/article/20111104/NEWS01/111040308/Judge-concerned-by-fairness-Ohio-death-penalty">unofficial death penalty moratorium</a> [AP report] as the federal courts consider the constitutionality of the state's death penalty procedure. In December 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ohio-supreme-court-rejects-challeng-to-lethal-injection-method.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the lethal injection method of execution and indicated that they would not hear further cases regarding lethal injection until the Ohio <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/">General Assembly</a> [official website] explicitly expanded state review of death penalty cases. In November 2009, Ohio adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">single-drug lethal injection protocol</a> [JURIST report], replacing the previously used three-drug method. The single-drug lethal injection method has faced numerous challenges, with one case reaching the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. In March 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate challenging the state's single-drug execution protocol. Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new procedure in December 2009. The change in procedure came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> [JURIST report] of its lethal injection practices in September 2009, following the planned execution of inmate Romell Broom failed when a suitable vein for the drugs' administration could not be found.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This plea follows what have been some of the deadliest clashes of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">movement that began in Syria last March</a> [JURIST report], and have left at least 13 people dead over the past few days. According to a <a href="http://syriamoi.gov.sy/portal/index.php?page=show&ex=2&dir=news&lang=1&nid=244&nt=1&">statement</a> [press release, in Arabic] issued by the <a href="http://syriamoi.gov.sy/">Syrian Arab Republic's Ministry of Interior</a> [official website, in Arabic], the government is calling on "citizens who carried weapons, sold them, delivered them, transported them or funded buying them, and did not commit crimes, to hand themselves into the nearest police station." Given the recent violent turn of the once peaceful protests, the ministry added that it "assures those who turns themselves in ... will then be freed immediately and it will be considered as a general amnesty."

<p>The ministry's offer comes after Syrian protesters have long endured harsh treatment from authorities. In August, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-protests-and-arrests-lead-to-deaths-of-at-least-88-detainees-amnesty-report.php">88 Syrians were killed</a> [JURIST report] while in custody as a result of their protest, and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has reported on several occasions that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">Syrian forces may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. This is also not Syria's first attempt to quell the uprising with the promise of amnesty. Last June, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-al-assad-grants-amnesty-for-crimes-committed-during-protests.php">al-Assad granted amnesty</a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed during protests before June 20, but added that serious offenses and private prosecutions were not included in the pardon. Prior to that, the president also attempted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-grants-amnesty-for-political-prisoners.php">grant amnesty to political prisoners</a> [JURIST report], including those of the previously banned <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/articles.php?pid=10005">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website], but was overturned by opposition leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of punishing certain economic crimes with imprisonment, the proposed law would instead impose a fine. This could mean the controversial seven-year sentence given to Tymoshenko in October would be reduced to a fine. The draft law entitled "On introduction of amendments into some legislative acts of Ukraine (as for humanization of responsibility for crimes in the sector of economic activity)" (No. 9221) was <a href="http://un.ua/eng/article/352183.html">proposed by President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [UNA report] earlier this year and was passed in its first reading. It was being brought before parliament for a final debate and vote when members of Tymoshenko's Bloc-Batkivschyna faction successfully delayed its consideration until next week. The draft law <a href="http://un.ua/eng/article/353844.html">amends various sections</a> [UNA report] of the Ukrainian criminal code, including <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Article 365</a> [text], under which Tymoshenko was convicted, in a way that would <a href="http://eng.obozrevatel.com/politics/president-tables-in-parliament-bill-on-decriminalization-of-economic-crimes.htm">decriminalize economic and administrative crimes</a> [Observer report].

<p>Tymoshenko was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">convicted </a> [JURIST report] in October of abusing her power when she signed a gas agreement with Russia that was alleged to have violated Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Her prosecution has been <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">highly controversial</a> [JURIST comment] and has draw harsh criticisms from all over the world. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">EU has condemned</a> [JURIST report] her conviction as politically motivated and has indicated that it could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian President Yanukovych. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law, which will take effect on November 10, will still limit home ownership to one house in the city and one seasonal house in the country, but will allow Cubans the freedom to buy, sell and trade these homes at their discretion. All transactions will take place <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111103/NEWS04/111109823&SAXOEdAjax=1&AjaxRequestUniqueId=1320342356265175&template=printart">through Cuban bank accounts</a> [AP report] so they can be regulated, and parties will be required to obtain a seal of notary for every transaction. There will also be bank commission collected for each sale and a tax of 8 percent of the value of the property. 

<p>Cubans have not had the right to buy and sell houses since 1959 when former president Fidel Castro took over. President Raul Castro <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/raul_castro/index.html">promised in May</a> [NYT report] that this right would come by the end of the year.

Raul Castro insisted in a <a href="http://www.walterlippmann.com/rc-04-19-2011.html">report</a> [text] to the Cuban Congress in April these changes are not moves toward capitalism, but simply restructuring of the socialist system that will allow the state to spend more resources on administering social services and less on regulating business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report describes poor health and safety standards, regular 12-hour and 18-hour work shifts, and anti-union activity. Workers also reportedly face the threat of being fired if they refuse to work under unsafe conditions. Although not reported to the government, injuries and health standards are in violation of Zambian and international labor law. The report is based on three field investigations and interviews conducted between November 2010 and July 2011. The report states:<blockquote>Human Rights Watch urges the new Sata government to adopt the necessary measures to enforce Zambia's labor laws, and to ensure its laws conform with international standards. To begin, Human Rights Watch recommends that the government work to improve mine safety by ensuring there is sufficient staffing and equipment at the Mines Safety Department (MSD). Many inspectors have left their posts to pursue employment in the private sector, where remunerations are higher, and a government imposed hiring freeze has crippled the body's effectiveness.</blockquote>HRW recommends that the Mines Safety Department increase the fines imposed against violation of safety regulations or labor laws by mining operations to deter future violations. Zambia's president, Michael Sata, elected in September, has been an outspoken critic of Chinese labor practices and campaigned to protect worker's rights and ensure that companies follow Zambia's labor laws.

<p>China has faced criticism from various rights groups for human rights violations. On Tuesday, UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-concerned-with-china-restrictions-on-Tibet.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] over human rights restrictions on Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in China's Sichuan province. In October, three human rights groups on called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-call-for-china-to-release-nobel-winner-liu.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of Nobel peace Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], imprisoned on an <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] in China for "inciting subversion of state power" and dissidence. Amnesty International, HRW and Chinese Human Rights Defenders released simultaneous press briefings urging freedom for Liu, and his wife Liu Xia, who remains under house arrest. In July, Senior Researcher in the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, argue that in order for the Chinese government to legitimately address human rights concerns, it must acknowledge the shortcomings of previous efforts and ensure that government officials and security forces <a href="/hotline/2011/07/phelim-kine-china-rights-plan.php">follow and enforce human rights protections</a> [JURIST comment].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee, composed of independent experts, has recently examined Iran's progress in adopting the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text]. Committee members expressed concern about the discrimination and arrest of religious minorities and homosexuals, as well as the frequent use of capital punishment in Iran. The committee's concerns follow a UN <a href="http://news.bahai.org/sites/news.bahai.org/files/documentlibrary/859_Special_Rapporteur_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] from last month that suggested <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/iran-human-rights-violations-increasing-un-report.php">human rights violations in Iran are on the rise</a> [JURIST report]. The report cited an increase in persecutions among political opposition and journalists, the torture and mistreatment of detainees, the significant administration of the death penalty to people under 18 years of age and "exorbitant bail requirements" for human rights defenders and religious practitioners. Iran's deputy ambassador to the UN, Eshagh al-Habib, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/iran-denies-un-report-on-increasing-human-rights-violations.php">criticized the report</a> [JURIST report] for being untrue and biased. Despite these accusations, committee member Michael O'Flaherty from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] said he was hopeful the investigation would have a positive impact on human rights conditions in Iran. 

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized for its alleged human rights abuses. Jailed Iranian journalist <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile] in July <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/onlymehdi/O0QzEWBcteRm34lS1J986SdAkEfGni6OX9oU3we7Z7mOkO9UaRO3RcZJfaLK/Letter.doc">urged</a> [letter, DOC, in Persian] UN Special Rapporteur on Iran Ahmed Shaheed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/imprisoned-iran-journalist-urges-un-probe-of-prison-conditions.php">investigate prison conditions in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. In May, rights groups decried Iran's <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-criticize-iran-detention-of-lawyers.php">persecution of lawyers</a> [JURIST report]. In January, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. In January, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. Sotoudeh was found guilty of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010.

The investigation could potentially <a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/11/european-commission-investigates.html">force Samsung to halt action</a> [FOSS Patents report] against Apple over smartphone patents in the EU. The European Commission enforces <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/legislation/articles.html">Articles 101 - 109</a> [materials] of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:FULL:EN:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the EU</a> (TFEU) [text, PDF; <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:SOM:EN:HTML">materials</a>]. Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits "directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions" and "limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers." The EU patent system has a compulsory licensing regime under the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm">Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPs) [materials]. TRIPs gives entities the freedom to negotiate licenses, but if they are unable to reach an agreement within a reasonable length of time then the government may impose a compulsory license under <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3c_e.htm#5">Article 31</a> [text]. Although both Samsung and Apple have been asked to provide additional information for the European Commission's initial investigation, commentators suggest that Samsung is the primary target of the investigation. The European Commission's investigation will likely revolve around whether Samsung has undertaken negotiations for a "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory" licensing regime, or whether they are using their patent rights to attempt to impose a harsher licensing agreement on Apple. However, Apple in turn has also asserted intellectual property rights against Samsung. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">Apple</a> [JURIST reports] have filed complaints with the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] attempting to stop the importation of the others smartphones and tablets.

<p>The European Commission's investigation is the latest installment in the ongoing conflict between the two companies. In June Apple <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement-in-south-korea-court.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the Seoul Central District Court against the "Galaxy" line. In April, Apple also <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">filed a similar suit against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] in the US. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/samsung-sues-apple-for-patent-infringement.php">Samsung countered</a> [JURIST report] by filing patent infringement suits against Apple in three different countries, alleging that Apple had infringed its technology related to energy consumption and preventing data transmission errors. Though competitors, Samsung and Apple rely on each in business. Apple is the largest buyer of computer and phone chips, while Samsung is the world's largest manufacturer of those chips. In fact, after Apple's initial lawsuit against Samsung, Apple indicated a <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/computer/232972/samsung-crossed-the-line-apple-executive">willingness to continue working with Samsung</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] as a partner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay said, from the capital city of Chisinau, that her visit to Moldova was the first by a UN human rights chief, and that as the country strengthens its democracy its authorities need to address a number of concerns, including discrimination against minorities, a lack of social and economic protections for the impoverished and the need to shore up an independent judiciary to ensure equality. Pillay also noted the importance of a strong national infrastructure and education system in combating discrimination and inequality, and urged authorities to enact a comprehensive anti-discrimination law:<blockquote>During my talks with the Acting President, the Prime Minister and other senior ministers and officials I have discussed a range of problems related to discrimination against certain groups in Moldova, and discussed ways of combating it &#8212; most notably by enacting without further delay a truly comprehensive law banning discrimination on all grounds. My message to the Government &#8212; and to the public &#8212; is that diversity is among our highest values. A democracy is only as strong as its ability to protect its most vulnerable.</blockquote>Pillay also visited the Transnistrian region, an unrecognized breakaway territory located on Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine that claimed independence in 1990. Pillay held meetings with the de facto authorities there regarding violations of human rights of prisoners, including arbitrary detentions, torture and ill-treatment of detainees. Pillay noted that the engagement of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] with the de facto authorities does not amount to legitimization, only an effort by the OHCHR to address human rights issues in the region.

<p>Moldova has taken several steps in recent years to become a more democratic nation. This year the country joined the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] after becoming the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/moldova-ratifies-icc-treaty.php">114th signatory to the Rome Statute</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010. In her statement this week Pillay observed that the "country is clearly on the road to strengthening its democracy, and aims at a number of ambitious reforms" despite the current lack of human rights enforcement for certain segments of the population. Recently Pillay made a similar statement stressing the the importance of the rule of law in Tunisia, another country taking recent steps toward democracy, after the nation held its first free elections last month. Also last month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-international-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">criticized Syria</a> [JURIST report] for its failure to protect its population during the recent protests in that country, citing reports of snipers firing from rooftops at protesters and the use of live ammunition in the shelling of residential neighborhoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/gay-rights-group-to-sue-new-jersey-for-right-to-marry.php">seeks declaratory and injunctive relief</a> [JURIST report] against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. Assignment Judge Linda Feinberg dismissed the claims that the state law violates federal guarantees of due process and equal protection, but is allowing the the case to proceed with its claim that the civil union law is unconstitutional on state grounds, putting the controversial issue on track to eventually land in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Lambda Legal Deputy Legal Director Hayley Gorenberg praised the judge's decision:<blockquote>We are delighted that the New Jersey Superior Court will allow this case to continue ... By moving to dismiss, the government was trying to prevent us from showing exactly how the current classification system based on sexual orientation harms families. New Jersey&#8217;s exclusion interferes during medical crises, denies them health insurance, and leads to discrimination against them even in funeral homes. These families need marriage equality and should not have to live with a law that treats them as inferior.</blockquote> Opponents of the lawsuit have argued that there should be a referendum asking New Jersey residents whether they support a constitutional amendment allowing gay marriage. The court has not yet set a date to hear the case.

<p>Lamda Legal filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/new-jersey-high-court-declines-to-hear-same-sex-marriage-case.php">similar suit last year</a> [JURIST report], but the state Supreme Court declined to hear the case, holding that it must first be heard in the lower courts. In 2009, a Superior Court judge <a href = "http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/02/new-jersey-judge-grants-divorce-to-same.php">allowed a divorce to proceed between a same-sex couple</a> [JURIST report], but cautioned that this would not extend to legalizing same-sex marriage in New Jersey through the courts. In June when the suit was filed, New Jersey <a href = "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] reiterated that he will <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/new-jersey-s-christie-says-he-s-not-a-fan-of-gay-marriage.html">not sign a gay marriage bill into law</a> [Bloomberg report]. The statement was in reaction to New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] signing <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/A8354-2011">legislation</a> [A8354-2011 materials] <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">allowing same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST report] in that state. The legislation made New York the seventh US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriage, which is also legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].

In July, Judge Gregory Frost <a href = "http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/07/14/ruling-halts-ohio-executions.html">stayed the executions of two inmates</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report], agreeing with their arguments that Ohio executes inmates haphazardly, causing an unofficial death penalty moratorium as the federal courts considered the constitutionality of the state's death penalty procedure. Frost, who clarified that he was not ruling on officially reinstating the death penalty in all cases, stated that he was satisfied with the state of the reforms and would allow Brooks' execution to go forward as planned, despite his lawyers' arguments that the new policies have worsened the implementation of the death penalty. Frost's July decision decried Ohio's careless execution process, including not having required execution team members present, not documenting the drug mixtures used in the procedure and not checking inmates' veins prior to execution. Brooks' execution is scheduled for <a href = "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/03/former_east_cleveland_man_on_d.html">November 15</a> [<em>The Plain Dealer</em> report], although Brooks has <a href = "http://www.tribune-chronicle.com/page/content.detail/id/150853/Federal-judge-upholds-Ohio-execution-policies-.html?isap=1&nav=5031">appeals pending in state and federal courts</a> [AP report].

<p>Earlier this week, the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/SCO/justices/oconnor/default.aspx">Maureen O'Connor</a> [official profile] opened the first meeting of the state's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">death panel review committee</a> [JURIST report]. O'Connor <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ohio-death-penalty-procedure-to-be-reviewed.php">announced the formation of the committee</a> [JURIST report] in September, in response to Frost's July ruling. In December 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ohio-supreme-court-rejects-challeng-to-lethal-injection-method.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the lethal injection method of execution and indicated that they would not hear further cases regarding lethal injection until the Ohio <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/">General Assembly</a> [official website] explicitly expanded state review of death penalty cases. In November 2009, Ohio adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">single-drug lethal injection protocol</a> [JURIST report], replacing the previously used three-drug method. The single-drug lethal injection method has faced numerous challenges, with one case reaching the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. In March 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate challenging the state's single-drug execution protocol. Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new procedure in December 2009. The change in procedure came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> [JURIST report] of its lethal injection practices in September 2009, following the planned execution of inmate Romell Broom failed when a suitable vein for the drugs' administration could not be found.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law puts several conditions in place, advancing the former law of making a minor receive a judge's consent to have an abortion without parental notification. Now, judges may only permit abortion in cases where they have "clear and convincing evidence" that the abortion is in the best interest of the young woman after a hearing on the record. The hearing must be held within five days after petitioning the court for an abortion:<blockquote>At the hearing, the court shall hear do all of the following: Hear evidence relating to the emotional development, maturity, intellect, and understanding of the minor; the nature, possible consequences, and alternatives to the abortion; and any other evidence that the court may find useful in determining whether the minor should be granted the right to consent to the abortion or whether the abortion is in the best interests of the minor; Specifically inquire about the minor's understanding of the possible physical and emotional complications of abortion and how the minor would respond if the minor experienced those complications after the abortion; Specifically inquire about the extent to which anyone has instructed the minor on how to answer questions and on what testimony to give at the hearing.</blockquote>The law also requires the minor to meet with judges in their home county or an adjacent county, rather than the county they are having the abortion in, a stipulation some think may face <a href = "http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/11/05/kasich-signs-new-abortion-rules-for-minors.html">a constitutional challenge</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report]. <a href = "http://www.ohiolife.org">Ohio Right to Life</a> [advocacy website] stated previous requirements amounted to a <a href = "http://www.ohiolife.org/press-releases/2011/11/4/governor-john-kasich-signs-pro-life-legislation.html">rubber stamp for abortions</a> [press release] commending Kasich for signing the bill and called he and the state Congress the "most pro-life Governor and General Assembly in our state's history." Since Kasich took office, Ohio has passed three abortion restrictions, and has had a total of ten bills introduced on the subject. <a href = "http://www.prochoiceohio.org">NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio</a> [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.prochoiceohio.org/news/press/201111041.shtml">criticized the new law</a> [press release], noting, "Governor Kasich must not be very proud of signing this dangerous bill into law because he did so on a Friday afternoon during the final hours of the election season." 

<p>Kasich signed into law a bill <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ohio-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">banning abortions after 20 weeks</a> [JURIST report] in July, the last of several pieces of anti-abortion legislation in the state. That legislation requires doctors to determine the viability of the fetus and seek a second opinion as to whether the child is capable of surviving outside of the womb. In the event that the fetus is viable, an abortion would only be made available if the woman faced "death or a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." In June, the <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 54-43 to approve legislation that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ohio-lawmakers-approve-bill-prohibiting-abortion-after-fetal-heartbeat-detection.php">prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable</a> [JURIST report], which could occur as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. The month before, a judge for the <a href = "http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">upheld an Ohio law</a> that limits the use of the "abortion pill," overturning a 2006 <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-rules-ohio-anti-abortion.php">injunction</a> [JURIST reports]. The law requires that the use of the pill, RU-486, conform with federal guidelines, which currently do not allow the pill to be used after seven weeks of pregnancy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter, authored by Assistant Attorney General <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/aag/">Thomas Perez</a> [official profile], was in response to a letter the DOJ received from Strange on Wednesday, in which he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/03/alabama-immigration-law-s_n_1073689.html">questioned the legal authority</a> [AP report] the DOJ had to compel enrollment data from Alabama school districts. Citing the duty of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to investigate potential violations of civil rights laws that "protect educational opportunities for school children" and the complaints the DOJ has received regarding the state's controversial <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 56 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alabama+immigration">news archive</a>], Perez declared that the US Attorney General has "express authority" to investigate and enforce non-discrimination statutes related to education. Perez also challenged Strange's ability to speak for the schools, writing that it was the DOJ's understanding "that you do not represent the school districts we have contacted. Please let us know if that understanding is correct, so that we may proceed accordingly." The correspondence between the DOJ and Strange stems from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-warns-alabama-schools-on-state-immigration-law.php">letter sent earlier this week</a> [JURIST report] by the former to each school district in the state as a reminder that they must provide equal access to public education for all children, regardless of their immigration status.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] portions of the immigration law, including Section 28, which requires immigration status checks of public school students, and Section 10, which makes it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. The ruling came in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">motion filed</a> [JURIST report] by the DOJ and a coalition of immigrants rights groups after a judge for the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] twice<a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php"> refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] from taking effect. The DOJ argues that the "state regime contravenes the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration." Alabama state officials have <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">defended the law</a> [JURIST report] and argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law and that the text reflects a "spirit of cooperation with the federal government." The state officials point out that the law contains mechanisms safeguarding against unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and allegations suggesting provisions of the law would deter students from enrolling in school are speculative. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A senior officer and the former police chief of Rawalpindi, where the assassination took place, along with five militants, alleged members of the Pakistani Taliban, were among those <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/world/asia/7-pakistanis-are-indicted-in-benazir-bhuttos-killing.html">charged with conspiracy</a> [NYT report] in Bhutto's murder. Special prosecutor Chaudhry Azhar said negligence charges against the officers stem from their orders to remove evidence, hose down the crime scene two hours after the attack, and reduce security measures for Bhutto leading up to the attack. The five militants allegedly <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/11/20111151390323259.html">aided the suicide bomber and gunman</a> [Al Jazeera report].

<p>The Pakistani government and police forces have been criticized for their involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In April, the independent UN commission formed to investigate the assassination <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-commission-report-blames-pakistan.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] holding the Pakistani government and police forces responsible for failing to provide adequate security. The report also accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into the assassination. The three-member commission was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/un-names-bhutto-assassination.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009. Members included former Chilean Ambassador to the UN Heraldo Munoz, former attorney general of Indonesia Marzuki Darusman, and Peter Fitzgerald, a former deputy police commissioner in the Irish National Police who has served with the UN in other capacities. Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack in December 2007 that claimed the lives of at least 20 other people. At that time, Bhutto was the head of the opposition <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a>, which was challenging then-prime minister Pervez Musharraf's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pml.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid</a> (PML-Q) [party websites] in the lead-up to parliamentary elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, widely known as "Carlos the Jackal," is currently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/world/europe/carlos-the-jackal-goes-on-trial-for-bombings-in-france.html">serving a life sentence in France</a> [NYT report] for the murder of two French policemen and a Lebanese informer in 1975. Sanchez was convicted <em>in absentia</em> for those murders in 1992. He was captured by the French secret service in 1994, retried for those crimes and began serving a life sentence after he was <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/1997-12-23/world/9712_23_carlos_1_political-prisoner-prosecutor-gino-necchi-killings?_s=PM:WORLD">again convicted in 1997</a> [CNN report]. He faces new charges stemming from his alleged involvement in four bombings in France in 1982 and 1983, including two bombings that took place in Marseilles on New Year's Eve in 1983. A total of 11 people were killed in the bombings and nearly 200 were injured. The trial is expected to last for six weeks.

<p>The current charges against Sanchez stem from a lengthy investigation lead by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3031640.stm">Jean-Louis Bruguiere</a> [BBC profile], a French investigating judge. In May 2007, French officials <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/carlos-jackal-may-face-new-terror-trial.php">raised the possibility of charging</a> [JURIST report] Sanchez for the bombings. He was eventually formally charged, but a court date was not set until this year. In July 2006, the appeals chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] in Strasbourg <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/jailed-terrorist-appeals-solitary.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] from Sanchez claiming that the eight years he spent in solitary confinement in a French prison was a breach of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/europe-rights-court-says-eight-years.php">appeals chamber ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Sanchez' solitary confinement was not inhumane or otherwise violative of his rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two men were killed in an <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/BUESA/_FERNANDO_/PSOE/EE/ETA/asesina/Vitoria/dirigente/socialista/Fernando/Buesa/escolta/Ertzaintza/elpepipri/20000223elpepinac_37/Tes">explosion</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] in the town of Vitoria. The National Court, the highest judicial authority to hear terrorism cases, <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/11/07/actualidad/1320663141_710241.html">convicted Txapote</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] of the two murders and two counts of injury because two other people were also hurt in the attack. Txapote was first arrested in 2001 and has <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/former-eta-commander-txapote-jailed-for-105-years/story-e6frf7lf-1226188241208">already been sentenced</a> [AFP report] to imprisonment in Spain prior to his latest conviction. In 2006, he was convicted and sentenced to multiple years in prison, including 50 years imprisonment for kidnapping and murder of a town counselor, and another 82 years for killing a Basque socialist leader and 18 years for another attacked that injured no one. Spain has sentenced Txapote to a total of 308 year in prison and six murders, including the National court's latest opinion.

<p>Last month, the ETA announced a cessation of all armed activities, but the Spanish government continues to actively pursue charges against ETA leaders. In September, the Spanish National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/spain-court-sentences-former-basque-separatist-leader-for-terrorism.php">sentenced a former Basque separatist to 10 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for terrorism and trying to resurrect a banned political wing of ETA. In March 2010, the court sentenced a former Basque separatist party leader to two years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-court-sentences-former-basque.php">promoting terrorism</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that week, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-judge-accuses-venezuela.php">accused the Venezuelan government</a> [JURIST report] of aiding ETA in a plot to assassinate members of the Colombian government in Spain. In February 2010, the Interior Ministry of Spain said that it <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/basque-separatist-leader-arrested-in.php">took into custody</a> [JURIST report] the suspected ETA leader, along with two other people who are believed to be senior members of the group. Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier that ETA had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-9647.htm">Jackson v. Hobbs</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Jackson-USSC-cert-petition-FINAL-3-21-11.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a 14-year-old child convicted of homicide violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court has also been asked to decide whether such a sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when it is imposed upon a 14-year-old who did not personally kill the homicide victim, and whether such a sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when it is imposed upon a 14-year-old as a result of a mandatory sentencing scheme that categorically precludes consideration of the offender's young age or any other mitigating circumstances. The case will be heard in tandem with <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-9646.htm">Miller v. Alabama</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Miller-USSC-cert-petition-3-21-11-FINAL.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The Supreme Court ruled last year in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-life-sentences-for-juveniles-facing-non-homicide-charges.php">Graham v. Florida</a> [JURIST report] that the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments prohibits the imprisonment of a juvenile for life without the possibility of parole as punishment for the juvenile's commission of a non-homicide offense.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1032.htm">Magner v. Gallagher</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Brief-05-19-11-154113.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether disparate impact claims are cognizable under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt//about/hce/title8.php">Fair Housing Act</a> [text], and, if so, whether they should be analyzed under a burden shifting approach, a balancing test, a hybrid approach or some other test. There is a split among the circuit courts over which standard to apply. Respondents are rental property owners who argue that the petitioners violated the Fair Housing Act by "aggressively enforcing" the local housing code. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for petitioners, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/091209P.pdf">allowing the disparate impact claim</a> [opinion, PDF].</p>

<p>Also Monday, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> in the appeal of Duane Buck, a convicted murderer in Texas. Justice Antonin Scalia <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-stays-texas-execution.php">ordered a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] in September pending a determination on whether to grant <em>certiorari</em> in the case. Buck was not arguing his innocence, but rather improper practices during his sentencing hearing. A clinical psychiatrist testified that Buck, a black man, was more likely to commit another crime due to his race, and thus should be given the death penalty. Justice Samuel Alito issued a statement respecting the denial of <em>certiorari</em>, joined by Scalia and Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, saying this death sentence was "marred by racial overtones and a record compromised by misleading remarks and omissions made by the State of Texas in the federal habeas proceedings below."</p>

The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] has mandated that by September 2012, all cigarette packaging shall contain new <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/CigaretteWarningLabels/default.htm">warning labels</a> [FDA backgrounder] with graphic images of the health issues related to smoking and related textual warnings. A suit filed by the <a href = "http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds Co</a> [corporate website], the manufacturer of several popular cigarette brands, <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/motion-for-summary-judgment.pdf">requested the injunction</a> [complaint, PDF] on the basis that the new regulations violate their First Amendment rights and burden their right to commercial speech by compelling placement of the new warning labels on the top 50 and bottom 20 percent of all packaging and advertisements. Judge Richard Leon agreed with the plaintiff's assertions in his related <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2011cv1482-38">opinion</a> [text, PDF]:<blockquote>[T]his Court concludes that the plaintiffs have demonstrated: (1) a substantial likelihood of  success on the merits; (2) that they will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief; (3) that neither the Government, nor the public, will suffer any comparable injury as a result of the relief sought; and (4) that the public's interest in the protection of its First Amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech will be, in fact, furthered.</blockquote>The FDA based its arguments on a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-upholds-restrictions-on.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] issued in January 2010 by the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] which upheld the majority of restrictions on cigarette advertising imposed by the FSPTCA, including the new warning labels. Leon acknowledged this argument, but decided that ultimately the tobacco companies could prevail in their suit to prevent the implementation of the new warnings.

<p>In July, the <a href = "http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-on-tobacco-advertising.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the tobacco advertising case, <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/circuit-courts/ca6/10-5234/">Discount Tobacco City &#38; Lottery v. USA</a> [Justia backgrounder], on which the FDA has relied. The Sixth Circuit has not yet issued an opinion on the case. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the FSPTCA into law</a> [JURIST report], granting the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. The bill gives the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products but does not permit the agency to regulate tobacco leaf that is not in the hands of tobacco product manufacturers or producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco growers, tobacco warehouses and tobacco grower cooperatives. Cigarettes and other tobacco products have been subject to strict marketing regulations on both the federal and state levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tymoshenko's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-prosecutors-seek-7-year-sentence-for-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">resumed</a> at the end of September after a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-trial-delayed.php">two-week recess</a> [JURIST reports].

In its report, AI documented that there are still common and widespread patterns of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners despite the fact that these actions are outlawed by the legislation and criminalized under the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/1df6164eba292570802565da00559d96?Opendocument">Convention against Torture</a> (CAT) [text]. AI referred to additional sources, such as the <a href="http://www.humanrights.asia/countries/sri-lanka/countries/sri-lanka/resources/special-reports/AHRC-SPR-001-2011-SriLanka.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.humanrights.asia/">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website] that summarized 323 reported cases of torture by the Sri Lankan police officials from 1998 to 2011. According to the report, only three prosecutions were made under the CAT during its first 14 years of implementation (1994-2008). AI concluded that Sri Lanka failed to successfully prosecute officials who were convicted for violation of human rights in the country:<blockquote>Sri Lanka's own laws should, but fail to, provide protection from the torture and ill-treatment which is so often a consequence of arbitrary and incommunicado detention. Enforcement of laws and directives aimed at preventing torture require a clear implementation plan to ensure that all forces responsible for arrests and detentions are aware of and understand these laws and procedures, and that those who breach them are disciplined, including through criminal prosecution in fair trials of those who commit crimes.</blockquote>AI urged the Sri Lankan government to ensure that its investigation of allegations of torture as well as enforcement of the penalties against government officials engaged in torture and other ill-treatment against detainees are strictly enforced. In addition, AI called for an independent international investigation.

<p>Last month, a group of rights organizations and lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-urged-to-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Australia to investigate Sri Lankan war crimes and a top ranking official in the <a href="http://www.slhcaust.org/">Sri Lankan High Commission</a> [official website] in Canberra for war crimes that were allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan Navy during its fight against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. Earlier in October, the Sri Lankan government announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sri-lanka-unveils-5-year-action-plan-to-protect-human-rights-in-response-to-international-pressure--.php">adopt a five-year action plan</a> [JURIST report], the National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, which would take effect immediately. This announcement was in response to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to evaluate the alleged claims found within a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] that accused the Sri Lankan government of committing war crimes during the final stages of the conflict with the LTTE in 2009. The report was released in April of this year <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">stating</a> [JURIST report] that it found some credible evidence of the alleged war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-699.pdf">MBZ v. Clinton</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-to-hear-jerusalem-passport-arbitration-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine">political question doctrine</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to enforce a federal statute that explicitly directs the secretary of state how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad and on a passport. US citizen Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem in 2002. His parents asked the State Department to record his place of birth as Jerusalem, Israel, but were told it could only be listed as Jerusalem because the US does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. His parents filed suit in 2003, and a federal district court dismissed the suit as a political question. Counsel for the government argued:<blockquote>The Executive has determined that the passports it issues should not identify Israel as the place of birth for persons born in Jerusalem. Petitioner seeks relief ... that would countermand that executive judgment. But under the Constitution that is an exercise of the Executive's exclusive recognition power. The Constitution commits that power exclusively to the Executive and neither a court nor the Congress can override that judgment.</blockquote>Counsel for the petitioner said, "I don't think the Court is being asked to decide a question of foreign policy."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-577.pdf">Kawashima v. Holder</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-to-hear-immigration-case.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments to clarify what counts as an aggravated felony for purposes of removing an immigrant from the country. Petitioners Akio and Fusako Kawashima are natives and citizens of Japan who were living in California as lawful permanent residents. Petitioners were charged with, and pleaded guilty to, filing, and aiding and abetting in filing, a false statement on a corporate tax return. An immigration judge concluded that the convictions were "aggravated felonies" within the meaning of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)</a> [text], ordering petitioners to be removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision, and it was later <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kawashima-CA9-Opinion.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has reached the opposite conclusion. Several justices were skeptical of petitioners' position that an intentional lie does not necessarily mean an intent to deceive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law makes it a felony for someone who "publicly advertises, offers or holds himself or herself out as offering that he or she will intentionally and actively assist another person in the commission of suicide and commits any overt act to further that purpose." Defendants Ted Goodwin, Claire Blehr, Lawrence D. Egbert Nicholas Alec Sheridan were arrested in 2009 for allegedly violating that law by running an assisted death operation. The foursome pleaded not guilty to charges that they tampered with evidence, violated anti-racketeering laws and helped a cancer-stricken man kill himself. A lower court held that the law does not violate First Amendment guarantees, and the state Supreme Court decision is expected in the next few months.

<p>In 2009, a sharply divided <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that physician assisted suicide is not banned by state law, making Montana the third state to allow the practice after Oregon and Washington. The court upheld in part and reversed in part a lower court ruling, agreeing with its finding that physician assisted suicide is not illegal under state law, but giving no opinion on the greater constitutional question addressed by the lower court. Instead, it found in a 4-3 decision that physician assisted suicide was not rendered illegal under state statute or by public policy concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdnatesting.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cca.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://d2o6nd3dubbyr6.cloudfront.net/media/documents/AP-76675_-SKINNER_-_DNA_-_ORDER.pdf">stayed the execution</a> [order, PDF] of convicted murderer <a href="http://www.hankskinner.org/">Henry "Hank" Skinner</a> [advocacy website] in order to review changes to a state law that may permit DNA testing in relation to his case. Skinner, who was convicted in 1995 of killing his girlfriend, Twila Jean Busby, and her two adult sons, was scheduled to be executed Wednesday. Skinner and his attorneys argued that the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/07/2491394/texas-court-puts-off-execution.html">court must consider a new law</a> [AP report] passed by the Texas legislature that permits an offender to request DNA testing, despite refusing the testing as a trial strategy. Skinner's counsel had refused DNA testing at the time of Skinner's 1995 trial for fear that the testing would bolster the prosecution's case. Attorneys for the state contend that the law, which went into effect on September 1, does not apply. The court, however, granted Skinner's plea for consideration of the new Texas statute:<blockquote>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 64, which provides for DNA testing, has undergone several changes since its creation, but those changes have never been Skinner reviewed in the particular context of this case. Because the DNA statute has changed, and because some of those changes were because of this case, we find that it would be prudent for this Court to take time to fully review the changes in the statute as they pertain to this case.</blockquote>The court also ordered that the lower court submit its legal determinations for denying the request for new testing so that Skinner may make a meaningful appeal. The stay does not guarantee that evidence will be tested.

<p>Skinner has insisted he is innocent, saying he was not capable of committing the murders because of the amount of drugs and alcohol in his system on the day of the murders. While the prosecutors in the case did rely on some DNA evidence in the case, Skinner's attorneys argue they were selective in the tests they conducted. In March, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-9000.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-3 for Skinner in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-9000">Skinner v. Switzer</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a convicted prisoner seeking access to biological evidence for DNA testing <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-allows-death-row-inmate-to-access-dna-testing.php">may assert a civil rights claim</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">Section 1983</a> [text]. A year earlier, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-stays-execution-of.php">granted a temporary stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] just one hour prior to Skinner's scheduled execution so he could pursue his civil rights claim. In <span class="casename">District Attorney's Office v. Osborne</span>, the court held that a defendant does not have the right to obtain post-conviction access to the state's biological evidence in order to do DNA testing. The decision involved a claim for access under section 1983, but the majority rejected that approach saying it "would take the development of rules and procedures in this area out of the hands of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a focused manner and turn it over to federal courts applying the broad parameters of the Due Process Clause."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Lawrence King found this agreement to be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-oks-410m-settlement-bank-america-14900014">fair and reasonable</a> [AP report] even though customers will not be fully compensated for overdraft fees which averaged approximately $35 per transaction. Approximately 13.2 million customers who had a debit card with BOA between January 2001 and May 2011 will have money credited to their account or will receive checks from BOA as a result of this settlement. The settlement with BOA, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/bank-of-america-settles-excessive-overdraft-fee-lawsuit.php">reached in February</a>, was given <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bank-of-america-gains-preliminary-approval-of-class-action-settlement-for-illegal-overdraft-fees.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST reports] in May.

<p>BOA is among more than two dozen US, Canadian and European lenders named as defendants in the class action lawsuit, which consolidated claims across the country in 2009. In their <a href="http://www.bank-overdraft.com/pdf/20091102-bofa-complaint.pdf">amended complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plaintiffs claimed that BOA's practices were deceptive in that they did not reasonably notify customers that they had the option of opting out of the overdraft scheme and declining transactions. The complaint also alleged that BOA's excessive fees disproportionately effect low-income customers. BOA has been the target of several lawsuits. In June, BOA announced that it has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bank-of-america-to-pay-85-billion-to-settle-bad-mortgage-backed-securities-claims.php">agreed to pay $8.5 billion</a> [JURIST report] to settle claims that it sold bad securities contributing to the housing market collapse. The securities, called first-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization, were issued by the BOA unit Countrywide Financial Corporation, which it purchased for $4 billion in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law will put a fixed rate of A$23 per ton on carbon units with limits on how many can be auctioned and given out. The fixed price rate will take effect July 1, 2012, and will be raised each year until 2015. After 2015, the <a href="http://www.orer.gov.au/">Clean Energy Regulator</a> [official website] will be charged with setting out a new price for the units each year. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in a <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/transcript-joint-press-conference-canberra-19">press conference</a> [transcript]:<blockquote>This comes after a quarter of a century of scientific warnings, 37 Parliamentary inquiries and years of bitter debate and division. ... Today's vote means that the hard work now begins to cut carbon pollution and we will do that, cutting carbon pollution by 160 million tonnes in 2020, the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road.</blockquote>Money raised from the carbon units tax will be used to <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/australia-poised-clean-energy-future">fund tax cuts</a> [press release] for Australian households, and the law is expected to create new jobs in development of clean energy sources.

<p>Passage of this law comes as world leaders prepare to attend the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">Durban Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] next month to discuss global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The Australian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/australia-senate-rejects-carbon.php">rejected a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] right before the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/meeting/6295.php">2009 UN Climate Change Conference</a>  that would have established a cap-and-trade system and gone into effect in July 2011. Opposition to the 2009 bill claimed it would result in higher energy prices and that it would be useless for Australia to adopt cap-and-trade if the US did not also adopt a similar system. The US has still failed to adopt such a system, but President Barack Obama continues to push for it even as he is met with strong opposition by legislators concerned about negative effects on jobs and the economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Changes to procedures introduced by the regulations include a provision that allows the judge in a military trial to approve the costs of a "learned counsel" in cases involving the possibility of capital punishment. Non-party observers, such as the media, will also be able to "challenge the applicability of a protective order to the military judge's designation of information as protected information [by] submitt[ing the challenge] in writing to the Chief Clerk with a copy to the attorneys of record." The new regulations were signed on Sunday by <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=186">Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter</a> [official profile]. In a forward to the regulations, Carter writes that the guidebook: <blockquote>[P]rovides guidance for practitioners in military commissions and ... [t]o the extent that the guidance here differs from that which applies in courts-martial, that difference is necessitated by the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence operations during hostilities or by other practical need, consistent with Military Commissions Act of 2009.</blockquote>The guidebook also include a sample prosecution in which a captive is charged with murder and pillage. The regulations replace the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/Portals/0/Reg_for_Trial_by_mcm.pdf">Regulation for Trial by Military Commissions</a> [text, PDF] issued in April 2007. 

<p>The regulations were announced just days before the military commission at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] is set to arraign <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">news archive</a>]. Last week, US <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/guantanamo-prisoner-can-be-indefinitely-detained-despite-acquittal-prosecutors.php">prosecutors argued</a> [JURIST report] that even if suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=USS+cole">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] bomber Al-Nashiri is acquitted by a military tribunal, the US government has the authority to detain him in Guantanamo Bay until the end of the hostilities in the US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=war+on+terror">war on terror</a> [JURIST news archive]. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Reyes, Al-Nashiri's defense attorney, argued that Al-Nashiri's inevitable indefinite detention <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/guantanamo-prisoners-lawyer-raises-challenge-to-tribunals.php">renders his trial merely a show</a> that lacks meaningful reprieve, and that jurors have the right to be informed that they are simply playing a role in a pre-determined political decision. Last month, al-Nashiri filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/guantanamo-prisoners-lawyer-raises-challenge-to-tribunals.php">motion to challenge</a> [JURIST reports] the method in which Guantanamo Bay military tribunals are conducted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At issue is  <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=350-363">California Civil Procedure Code &#167; 354.4</a> [text], which recognizes the World War I-era killings of more than one million Armenians by Turkish soldiers as a genocide. The Ninth Circuit has twice ruled on the issue. In December, the court <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/12/10/07-56722.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] its prior decision and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-reinstates-suit-by-armenian-genocide-victims.php">allowed a suit by the heirs</a> [JURIST report] of victims of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6045182.stm">Armenian genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=armenian+genocide">news archive</a>] to proceed. The heirs are seeking life insurance payments from German insurance companies. The insurers argue that the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/appeals-court-revisits-armenian-genocide-lawsuit-14900165#.TrlHdbKLO2Y">law should be struck down</a> [AP report] because both Turkey and the US do not recognize the Armenian genocide. The heirs and their lawyers maintain that the US does not have an official policy on the civil unrest in Turkey and, therefore, there is no conflict.

<p>The Armenian genocide remains a contentious issue in US law and politics. In August 2010, a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since the virus was introduced into Haiti in October 2010, an <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/situation/">epidemic</a> [CDC backgrounder] has killed more than 6,600 Haitians and infected over 475,000 more. The victims' petition alleges that the UN is liable for failing to screen its representatives as they entered Haiti, dumping untreated waste into Haiti's most important river, the Artibonite, and failing to adequately to respond to the epidemic. Mario Joseph, a lawyer for the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI), said Tuesday, "this is an opportunity for the United Nations to demonstrate that its stated ideals of eliminating disease and encouraging respect for rights are not just empty promises." In January, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sgsm13338.doc.htm">appoint an independent panel</a> [press release] to investigate the source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti. The panel's <a href="http://ijdh.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf">final report</a> [text, PDF], published in May, stated that the outbreak was likely caused by "human activity," but also concluded the resultant epidemic was caused by a "confluence of circumstances" and was "not the fault of ... a group or individual." Brian Concannon, IJDH's Director, indicated the victims rely on UN reports and law in their petition. 

<p>In June, more than 3,000 Americans signed a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Final%20Petition%20Deportations.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-urged-to-cease-haitian-deportations.php">urging him to stop deportations to Haiti</a> [JURIST report] on humanitarian grounds. The letter suggested that deported citizens were immediately imprisoned in Haiti, where unsanitary prison conditions carried a high risk of exposure to the cholera epidemic as well as other deadly diseases. In April, the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Report on Human Rights Practices [materials], reporting that <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154509.htm">Haiti</a></a> [materials] has faced significant human rights abuses following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-confronts-rising-lawlessness.php">breakdown of government control</a> [JURIST report] after the 2010 earthquake. On January 12, 2010, a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php">7.0 magnitude earthquake</a> [USGS backgrounder] caused at least 50,000 deaths and massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti. The most devastated city was the capital, Port-au-Prince, where MINUSTAH said that up to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/documents/sg_remarks_15012010.pdf">50 percent of buildings</a> [statement] have been destroyed or damaged, including the country's presidential palace, the UN Mission headquarters and the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-inmates-escape-collapsed-prison.php">main prison</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendant, Abdi Aden Magan, who now lives in Ohio, is charged with torture in connection with actions that allegedly occurred during the military dictatorship of Mohammad Siad Barre. The suit was <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?id=807">filed</a> [press release] in 2010 by the <a href="http://www.cja.org/index.php">Center for Justice and Accountability</a> (CJA) [advocacy website] on <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=422">behalf of Abukar Hassan Ahmed</a> [case materials], a former law professor and human rights attorney who alleges that Magan ordered his brutal torture in retaliation for Ahmed's criticism of the Barre regime's abuses of the <a href="http://www.somalilaw.org/Documents/Constitution1960.pdf">Somali Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Magan argues that the suit was filed in the wrong county and should therefore be dismissed. He also argues that the suit was filed too long after the occurrence of the alleged abuse. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] filed a motion in the case arguing that Magan should not be allowed to claim immunity from the allegations. 

<p>In April, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-somalia-pm-can-be-questioned-under-oath-in-federal-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a federal suit against former Somali prime minister and defense minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=samantar">Mohamed Ali Samantar</a> [JURIST news archive]. Lawyers for Samantar had argued that the case should be dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired and because the courts should not interfere in political matters. In February, a federal judge ruled that Samantar was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-denies-immunity-to-former-somalia-pm.php">not entitled to legal immunity from civil lawsuits</a> [JURIST report]. This ruling came after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">unanimous decision</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010 that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> (FSIA) [28 USC &#167;&#167; 1330, 1602 et seq. text] does not provide foreign officials immunity from civil lawsuits. The suit has been ongoing since 2004 when the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking damages from Samantar under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350 text]. Samantar was minister of defense and later prime minister of Somalia from 1980 to 1990. Respondents claim that Samantar authorized torture and the extrajudicial killing of them and members of their family. The Isaaq clan, of which the plaintiffs are members, was subjected to systematic persecution during Samantar's time in office before the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm">collapse of the Somali government in 1991</a> [DOS backgrounder]. Samantar fled Somalia before the collapse of the government and now resides in Virginia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fisher</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-workers-compensation-arbitration.php">report</a>] that, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), "clearly established federal law" is limited to Supreme Court decisions "as of the time of the relevant state-court adjudication on the merits." Petitioner Eric Greene was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in a robbery of a convenience store in which the store's owner was shot and killed. At the trial, Greene objected to the admission of confessions of his conspirators and co-defendants on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause</a> [Sixth Amendment text] grounds. The court allowed the confessions with Greene's name redacted. He renewed this objection on appeal, arguing on the grounds of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-8653.ZS.html">Gray v. Maryland</a> [text], where a similarly redacted confession was deemed inadmissible. <span class="casename">Gray</span> was decided before Greene's conviction became final but after the state court's last decision on the merits. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that an opinion issued after a decision on the merits in state court is not "clearly established federal Law." Affirming the decision below, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:<blockquote>We must observe that Greene's predicament is an unusual one of his own creation. Before applying for federal habeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under <span class="casename">Gray</span>. ... Having forgone two obvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to provide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner contrary to both its text and our precedents.

<p>Under the AEDPA, a federal court may not grant <em>habeas</em> relief to a state prisoner with respect to any claim that has been "adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings" unless the state-court adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."

In the past week alone, approximately 60 people have been killed by military and security personnel, included 19 people who were killed on Sunday during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Spokesperson for the OHCHR, Ravina Samdasani, said, "we are deeply concerned about the situation and by the Government's failure to take heed of international and regional calls for an end to the bloodshed." Despite the Syrian government's announcement Saturday that 553 prisoners would be released, tens of thousands of prisoners remain in detention as dozens of protesters continue to be arrested each day.

<p>Last week, Syria announced that insurgents who have revolted against the government of president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] may <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-syria-announces-amnesty-for.php">qualify for amnesty</a> [JURIST report] if they turn themselves into authorities by November 12. This plea followed what have been some of the deadliest clashes of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">movement that began in Syria last March</a> [JURIST report], and left at least 13 people dead over the past few days. In October, the UN and the League of Arab States released statements condemning violence in Syria after an estimated 40 people were killed in protest-related encounters. Earlier in October, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the international community to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-international-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">protect civilian lives in Syria</a> [JURIST report]. In August, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-protests-and-arrests-lead-to-deaths-of-at-least-88-detainees-amnesty-report.php">88 Syrians were killed</a> [JURIST report] while in custody as a result of their protest, and the OHCHR reported on several occasions that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">Syrian forces may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A 47-year-old woman filed suit against the 
<a href="http://www.portsmouthdiocese.org.uk/">Portsmouth Roman Catholic Diocesan Trust</a> [church website] claiming that she was sexually abused by the Reverend Wilfred Baldwin during her childhood in a Catholic children's home. The diocese argued that they could not be held liable because Baldwin was not an employee, but Judge Alistair MacDuff rejected that argument:<blockquote>[Baldwin] was provided with the premises, the pulpit and the clerical robes. He was directed into the community with that full authority and was given free rein to act as a representative of the Church. ... He had been trained and ordained for the purpose. He had immense power handed to him by the defendants. It was they who appointed him to the position of trust which (if the allegations can be proved) he so abused.</blockquote>The case will be tried next month when another judge will decide whether the church is liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability, in which employers can be held culpable for the illicit behavior of their employees.

<p>Clergy abuse has become a contentious legal issue in recent years, as the Vatican has come under intense scrutiny related to allegations of sexual abuse of children by local church officials. In September, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ireland-clergy-abuse-amounts-to-torture-rights-group.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that clergy members' abuse of Irish children amounted to torture. The report, titled <a href="http://www.amnesty.ie/sites/default/files/INPLAINSIGHT%20(WEB_VERSION).pdf">In Plain Sight</a> [text, PDF] called special attention to "people in positions of power" who "ignore their responsibility to act." Also in September, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] against Vatican officials, including Pope Benedict XVI, for widespread sexual abuse and subsequent concealment of thousands of incidents. In February 2010, the Vatican <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">unveiled church procedures</a> [JURIST report] for dealing with sexual abuse cases, titled the "Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations", which set up a multi-tiered system of enforcement, including local bishops and the Pope himself. Since 2007, the Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled over 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of clergy abuse in the U.S. alone, totaling more than $900 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], claimed JPMC <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2011/11_-_November/Madoff_ex-clients_file_$19_bln_suit_against_JPMorgan/">willfully ignored signs of fraud</a> [Reuters report] and was complicit in concealing Madoff's activities. The lawsuit further alleges that even a cursory examination of Madoff's funds would have revealed that there was no investment strategy and the money was simply flowing between Madoff and customers. It notes that JPMC had plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy. Steve Berman, managing partner of <a href="http://www.hbsslaw.com/home/">Hagens Berman</a> [official website] and attorney for the plaintiffs, stated that JP Morgan was, in effect, the banking back-office for the Madoff Ponzi scheme, shuffling piles of money from one account to another at Madoff's request. The bank, in response to a similar lawsuit which was dismissed last week, stated that the plaintiff had failed to show that anyone at the bank knew of Madoff's scheme or deliberately worked with him in order to earn more fees. The court <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/11cv0913.pdf">dismissed the previous suit</a> [decision, PDF] because Irving Picard, appointed <a href="http://www.madoff.com/News.aspx">trustee</a> [official website], did <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/index_2011_11_02.php#38895">not have standing</a> [JURIST report] to seek money from the bank. Picard plans to appeal.

<p>Another case from earlier this year was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18079616256181220542&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">dismissed</a> [opinion] against <a href="http://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/3/personal?home=personal&code=PPG0011159&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=HBUS_PPG0011159">HSBC Holdings</a> [corporate website] because the trustee had "no personal stake in the outcome of the controversy." Picard also plans to appeal this decision. The first payouts to Madoff's victims were <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the court in July. Picard <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">filed almost 60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010 after being <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff/trusteeorder.pdf">appointed trustee</a> [order] in 2008. Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme in March 2009, and was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1259.pdf">US v. Jones</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court will decide whether the government's warrantless use of a <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=gps">global positioning systems</a> (GPS) [JURIST news archive] tracking device on respondent's vehicle to monitor its movements on public streets violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The government argued that under <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/460/276/">US v. Knotts</a> [opinion text], a GPS tracker is as permissible as monitoring a car by using a beeper inside the car for tracking purposes. Respondent's attorney argued that placing the GPS in the car created a seizure of the vehicle: "You have an invasion of his possessory interest, placement on the car. Physical invasion of a possessory interest ... is more significant, has always been viewed by this Court as more invasive than mere video&#8212;mere visual surveillance."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1259.pdf">Smith v. Cain</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-upholds-gender-discrimination-ruling-takes-4-more-cases.php">report</a>], formerly <span class = "casename">Smith v. Louisiana</span>, the court heard the <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/11/argument-preview-the-court-and-the-d-a-again/">latest of several allegations of prosecutorial misconduct</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] out of the <a href = "http://www.nola.gov/en/GOVERNMENT/Orleans-District-Attorney">New Orleans District Attorney's office</a> [official website], in this case whether a series of violations of case law violated Juan Smith's due process rights. Smith's attorney opened with an exhaustive list of impropriety in the case:<blockquote>In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense before trial. This case presents a flagrant violation of that principle. The Orleans Parish district attorney's office produced almost no relevant evidence to the defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder based solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness. Unbeknownst to the defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know them if he saw them. The suppression of those statements alone justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's office in this case also engaged in the wholesale suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the shooting.</blockquote>In response, the district attorney's office defended the charges and asserted that Smith's case was handled professionally. Juan Smith was convicted on five counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Smith's petition for review was denied by the <a href = "http://www.lasc.org/">Supreme Court of Louisiana</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senior Circuit Judges Laurence Silberman in his opinion affirmed that Congress did not overstep its <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article One </a> [text] constitutional authority by requiring citizens to buy health insurance or pay a penalty on their taxes. The lawsuit, brought by the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> [advocacy website], claimed that the mandate unlawfully forces Americans to purchase a product for as long as they live, and that it also offends the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] religious freedoms of those who choose to rely on God for protection rather than purchased insurance. The court dismissed this argument. Judge Silberman cited several past federal mandates to support the majority:<blockquote>It certainly is an encroachment on individual liberty, but it is no more so than a command that restaurants or hotels are obliged to serve all customers regardless of race ... or that a farmer cannot grow enough wheat to support his own family. ... The right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute, and yields to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local&#8212;or seemingly passive&#8212;their individual origins.</blockquote>Although Judge Brett Kavanaugh disagreed with the majority, his opinion does not take a position based on merits of the law. Rather, the dissent contends that the court lacks and will continue to lack jurisdiction to review the PPACA until the date of its effect in 2014.

<p>This latest decision regarding the constitutionality of the PPACA's individual mandate is perhaps yet another step toward the law's ultimate fate in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website]. As of now, there are three health care appeals pending before the court. In October, both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/virginia-appeals-health-care-dismissal-to-supreme-court.php">state of Virginia</a> and <a href=" /paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php ">Liberty University</a> appealed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] made by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] that rejected all claims based on a lack of standing. Shortly before that, in September, the US <a href = &#8220;http://www.justice.gov/ &#8220;>Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) along with 26 individual states asked the court to review a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], which asserted that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">PPACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], but that the remainder of the act is not. While the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the PPACA's individual mandate</a> in June, the decision was also <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the Thomas More Law Center.</p>

The initiative, which would have given fetuses rights from the moment of conception, was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/miss-defeats-life-conception-ballot-initiative-14911129">defeated by more than 55 percent</a> [AP report] of the state's voters. The primary goal of the legislation was an attempt to make <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] illegal on the theory that a woman's right to choose an abortion cannot outweigh the fetus' right to life, if the fetus is at all points following conception, considered a person. Opponents of the initiative <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/mspersonhood">argued that the measure was "extreme"</a> [CRR statement] and that it could have extensive implications to women's reproductive health beyond outlawing abortion. According to some legal scholars the initiative could have <a href="/forum/2011/11/jonathan-will-personhood-amendment.php">limited access to some types of contraception</a> [JURIST op-ed] and fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization (IVF). Pro-Choice advocacy groups also claimed that the initiative could have put doctors and women at risk of criminal prosecution for providing routine gynecological care. Proponents of the measure <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/what-happens-if-the-mississippi-personhood-amendment-passes/248095/#">rejected the idea</a> [<em>The Atlantic</em> report] that the initiative would have banned either abortion or contraception, stating that the initiative would only redefine the term 'person' within existing laws, which would not provide any provisions regarding enforcement. Proponents maintained that the state's legislature would have limited the application of the new definition to laws outlawing abortion. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/appellate_courts/sc/sc.html">Supreme Court of Mississippi</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/appellate_courts/sc/sc.html">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in September that the initiative <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mississippi-high-court-upholds-election-to-define-personhood.php">could be placed on the ballot</a> [JURIST report]. The ruling came after two Mississippi citizens filed a lawsuit claiming the initiative violated <a href="http://www.iandrinstitute.org/New%20IRI%20Website%20Info/I&R%20Research%20and%20History/I&R%20at%20the%20Statewide%20Level/Constitution%20and%20Statutes/Mississippi.pdf">Article 15, Section 273(5)(a)</a> [text, PDF] of the Mississippi Constitution. The court refused to rule on the constitutionality of the initiative itself, but concluded that it could not interfere with or question the validity of a legislative proposal prior to the election. The court, therefore, ultimately dismissed the challenge on the basis that Measure 26 is not ripe for review. Colorado voters <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16506253">struck down</a> [<em>Denver Post</em> report] a similar <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/LCS/Initiative%20Referendum/0910InitRefr.nsf/0/ed0d797d3ffe6fb0872576f5005c1efd/$FILE/Amendment%2062%20FinalDraftCombined.pdf">ballot initiative</a> [text, PDF] in November 2010 that would have amended the state's <a href="http://law.justia.com/colorado/constitution/index.html">constitution</a> [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">extend rights to fetuses</a> [JURIST report] and would have effectively outlawed abortion. In November 2007, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Supreme_Court/Index.cfm">Colorado Supreme Court</a> [official website] approved the language of an anti-abortion group's proposed ballot initiative that <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/colorado-high-court-oks-ballot.php">would amend the Colorado constitution</a> [JURIST report] to define a fertilized egg as a "person" entitled to "inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law" under the state constitution. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty-staff/cborgmann.html">Caitlin Borgmann</a> argues that redefining personhood is just <a href="/forum/2011/05/caitlin-borgmann-constitutional-reproductive-rights.php">one of several approaches aimed at curtailing abortion</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.sos.ms.gov/Elections/Initiatives/Initiatives/eminent_domain_initiative_Rvance_E_10-7-2009.pdf">approved measure</a> [initiative, PDF] would prohibit, with certain exceptions, state and local government from conveying acquired private property to other persons or private businesses for a period of 10 years after acquisition. The process of filing and completing eminent domain proceedings is not affected by the initiative, as its restrictions have no effect until acquired property is vested with the condemnor:<blockquote>No property acquired by the exercise of eminent domain under the laws of the State of Mississippi shall, for a period of ten years after its acquisition, be transferred or any interest therein transferred to any person, non-governmental entity, public-private partnership, corporation, or other business entity ...</blockquote>However, the prohibition would not apply to certain exercises of eminent domain, including where public nuisance, structures unfit for human habitation or abandoned property are concerned. Additional exceptions to the prohibition include drainage and levee facilities, roads, bridges, ports, airports, common carriers and utilities. To place this initiative on the ballot in Mississippi required 30,006 signatures, and 119,251 signatures were in fact collected. The measure was approved in the general election with nearly three-fourths of the vote.

<p>The power of the government to take private property and convert it into public use is a doctrine long held. States can enact limitations on government takings to further citizen protections flowing from the Fifth Amendment. Last year voters in Nevada <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nevada-voters-reject-eminent-domain-ballot-measure.php">rejected a ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] that would have expanded state power by defining five exceptions to an existing general prohibition against exercising eminent domain to transfer property from one private party to another. The restriction on the state's ability to use eminent domain to acquire private property was approved by voters through a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nevada-restricts-eminent-domain-ohio.php">ballot initiative in 2008</a>, which was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eminent-domain-restrictions-approved.php">originally voted on in 2006</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2009 Texas <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/texas-voters-approve-amendment-limiting.php">voters approved an initiative</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit government officials from taking private property and allotting it to private buyers for the purpose of economic development or to increase tax revenues unless the property owner consents. The Texas measure further limited government ability to enforce eminent domain by requiring approval of two-thirds of the bicameral legislature. New Jersey <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/new-jersey-high-court-limits-scope-of.php">limited the exercise of eminent domain</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, although it was through the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] rather than a ballot initiative. The Connecticut legislature <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/connecticut-legislature-approves.php">approved eminent domain restrictions</a> [JURIST report] in the same year. During the 2006 mid-term elections <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eminent-domain-restrictions-approved.php">voters in nine states approved ballot initiatives</a> [JURIST report] restricting the use of eminent domain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum, in defiance of the federal <a href = "http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C178.txt">Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act</a> [text], will not go into effect unless the state wins a lawsuit against the US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. A previous effort to challenge the federal law, which bans all sports betting in any state but Nevada, Montana, Oregon and Delaware, was dismissed until the New Jersey voters could voice their opinions on the referendum. The new law will allow sports gambling at Atlantic City casinos and racetracks, including betting on amateur and college sports. There is a restriction on gambling on New Jersey-college sports. However, wagers could be made by any means to the casino, including online. Legislators are prepared to <a href = "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/nj_residents_vote_on_legalizin.html">introduce the new law</a> [<em>The Star-Ledger</em> report] on Wednesday, but have not announced when their new lawsuit will proceed. <a href = "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> (R) [official website] <a href = "http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9QP9CT00.htm">supports both the referendum and lawsuit</a> [AP report].

<p>There is a presumptive prohibition on most forms of gambling in the US, although in Europe such bans have been found to violate EU law. The <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/SupremeCourt/">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/washington-high-court-upholds-states-internet-gambling-ban.php">ruled last year that a state ban on online gambling</A> [JURIST report] is constitutional. That month, the EU <a href="http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm">Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] delivered three judgments <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/eu-court-strikes-down-germany-gambling-restrictions.php">striking down gambling restrictions</a> [JURIST report] in Germany because the regulations were not designed to protect public interest. The ECJ upheld a Swedish law <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/eu-court-reaffirms-nation-bans-on-online-gambling.php">restricting Internet gambling</a> [JURIST report]. The ECJ held that bans on Internet gambling were acceptable for cultural, moral or religious reasons, but there should be no discrimination. The court concluded that Sweden's ban on Internet gambling was in line with EU laws, but that the nation's lottery laws were not allowed to penalize foreign gambling agencies differently from domestic agencies. In 2006, the US <a href = "/paperchase/2006/10/bush-signs-tough-internet-gambling.php">signed a significant ban on Internet gambling</a> [JURIST report],  making it illegal for banks or credit card companies to process transactions involving Internet gambling. However, enforcement of the law has been <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-delays-enforcement-of.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ballot included a <a href = "http://www.sos.ms.gov/Elections/Initiatives/Initiatives/Voter%20Identification-PW%20revised.pdf">disclaimer</a> [referendum brochure text, PDF] explaining a government-issued photo identification costs approximately $14. Several rights groups, including the <a href = "http://www.aclu-ms.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi</a> (ACLU-MS) and the Mississippi <a href = "http://www.naacp.org/content/main">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) [advocacy websites] have stated this amounts to a "poll tax." Although the law allows for an ID to be issued for free if the person doesn't have one, the re-issuance of essential documents for that, such as birth certificates or Social Security cards, have a fee attached. Both groups are looking into a <a href = "http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20111109/NEWS04/111090358/Voter-ID-initiative-passes?odyssey=mod%7Cdefcon%7Cimg%7CHome">constitutional challenge of the new law</a> [<em>Clarion Ledger</em> report].

The law amends the <a href = "http://www.leg.wa.gov/LAWSANDAGENCYRULES/Pages/constitution.aspx">Washington state constitution</a> [text] to reduce the residency requirement for voting in presidential elections from 60 days to 30.

In a thorough analysis of the appropriate amount of the fine, Judge Jed Rakoff <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=136">handed down a $92.8 million penalty</a> [opinion, PDF] in the culmination of a civil lawsuit against Rajaratnam brought by the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website]. The penalty is the largest fine ever imposed on an individual in an SEC insider trading case. Rakoff summarized the state of the law:<blockquote>SEC civil penalties, most especially in a case involving such lucrative misconduct as insider trading, are designed, most importantly, to make such unlawful trading "a money-losing proposition not just for this defendant, but for all who would consider it, by showing that if you get caught ... you are going to pay severely in monetary terms."</blockquote>By statute the court is empowered to "impose a penalty of up to, but no more than, 'three times the profit gained or the loss avoided.'" Rakoff reasoned that Rajaratnam's fortune was considerably more than the fines imposed on him as a result of his criminal convictions and felt the punishment should be relative the the one-time billionaire's net-worth, intentionally depriving Rajaratnam of a "material part of his fortune." Rajaratnam has already been ordered to pay a $10 million fine and forfeit $53.8 million in profits since he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of insider trading in May.

<p>Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] last month after he was convicted of orchestrating the largest insider trading case in US history. The jury found him guilty of nine counts of securities fraud and five counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and others have been implicated in the insider trading scheme with Rajaratnam. Danielle Chiesi pleaded guilty in January and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ex-hedge-fund-trader-settles-sec-civil-charges.php">settled with the SEC</a> [JURIST reports] in July. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> last September and was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. </p>]]></content:encoded>

It also holds that "purchase or sale of health care or health insurance" cannot be prohibited and outlaws imposition of penalties or fines for buying or selling health care or insurance. The amendment will take effect in 30 days. Proponents of the proposal claim it will bar government from controlling their health care options, help <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/upload/ballotboard/2011/3-argument-for.pdf">protect the health care industry from government regulations</a> [SOS materials, PDF] that hurt its effectiveness and save jobs in the health care.

<p>The proposition was a response to the 2009 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590 text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>], which requires all Americans buy some form of health care coverage. The health care law's constitutionality has been challenged in multiple lawsuits. Last month, the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Legal Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] and 105 members of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/advocacy-group-lawmakers-urge-supreme-court-to-hear-health-care-challenge.php">filed an <em>amicus</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], urging the court to take up a Florida case challenging the law. In September, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and a group of 26 states <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-appeal-to-supreme-court-on-health-care-law.php">filed petitions with the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] seeking a ruling on the constitutionality of PPACA.

It would have mandated that public workers pay 15 percent of their health insurance premiums and at least 10 percent of their salary to pensions. The proposed bill was strongly <a href="http://stateimpact.npr.org/ohio/2011/11/08/ohio-issue-2-results-voters-repeal-collective-bargaining-law/">defeated with 61 percent</a> [NPR report] of the votes placed to repeal the law and only six counties supporting the bill with a majority of votes. Ohio <a href="http://governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] argues that the law was not an attempt to eliminate unions, but was aimed at restoring the balance and to help close the state's budget gap. Another proponent, <a href="http://betterohio.org/">Building a Better Ohio</a> [advocacy website] argued that the law was necessary because public unions had grown too powerful and cuts were <a href="http://www.betterohio.org/sites/default/files/facts/Issue2-CaseforReform.pdf">necessary for budget control</a> [advocacy materials, PDF]. Conversely, advocacy group <a href="http://www.weareohio.com/landing/thankyou.html">We Are Ohio</a> [advocacy website] praised the election results, saying that the vote <a href="http://weareohio.com/news/pr/110811.html">supported public employees</a> [press release]. Kasich said he was unsure if he would try again to pass some aspects of SB 5. 

<p>The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">passed</a> in March, but was placed on referendum after opponents <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ohio-collective-bargaining-law-to-go-before-voters-in-november.php">collected 915,456 signatures</a> [JURIST reports] in July.  Anti-union and anti-collective bargaining laws have been a major issue of controversy in the US this year. In July, a judge for the <a href="http://www.id.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-idaho-anti-union-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the enforcement of an Idaho <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1007.pdf">anti-union law</a> [SB 1007, PDF] that bans a union program that would subsidize employment for its members. In March, the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed an amendment to their current budget that would require public employees to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2011/03/30/nh_house_approves_anti_union_proposal/">make concessions automatically</a> [AP report] or become at-will employees. Earlier in March, Wisconsin <a href="http://walker.wi.gov/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] limiting the rights of state workers to collectively bargain. Although the law was enjoined by judicial order, it has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">since been upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/index.jsp">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website].<br />

Specifically, Brammertz <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/un-prosecutor-brammertz-wants-serbia-to-probe-who-helped-war-crimes-suspects-mladic-hadzic/2011/11/08/gIQAhlj00M_story.html">seeks to discover</a> [AP report] who assisted former Serbian general <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>], who evaded authorities for 16 years and former Croatian Serb rebel leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10733">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who remained on the run for seven. Both were wanted as a result of allegations of atrocities they committed during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Brammertz made his request while on a visit to Belgrade, were he will deliver a report to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] regarding Serbia's compliance with the tribunal.

<p>Last month, Brammertz said that he would not appeal the court's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">proceed with a single trial</a> [JURIST report] for Mladic. The prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icty-may-hold-two-trials-for-mladic.php">sought to separate the indictment</a> [JURIST report] in order to hold one trial for Mladic's conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the Bosnian civil war. The court <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10824">denied</a> [press release] the prosecutor's request on the grounds that separating the trials would be inefficient and could prejudice Mladic and unduly burden witnesses. Brammertz had argued that <a href="http://newsok.com/prosecutor-wont-appeal-mladic-trial-decision/article/feed/308574?custom_click=pod_headline_europe">splitting the trials was warranted</a> [AP report] because Mladic's health may decline over the course of the trial. Mladic <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/accused-war-criminal-on-trial-at-icty-admitted-to-hospital.php">was hospitalized</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month, allegedly due to pneumonia. Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt. In August, Hadzic <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hadzic-pleads-not-guilty-at-icty.php">entered a not guilty plea</a> to the charges against him after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-refuses-to-plead-at-icty.php">refusing to enter a plea</a> in July following his <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-extradited-to-hague-to-face-icty.php">extradition to the Hague</a>.

According to Ocampo, an investigation into the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-libya-icc-idUSTRE7A82LA20111109">use of rape by Gaddafi forces</a> [Reuters report] is nearly finished, and the results of this investigation may be used to file additional charges against Libya's chief of intelligence, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [warrants], among others. It has been alleged that al-Senussi was involved in the ordering and organizing of mass rapes. While al-Senussi is implicated in these new allegations, Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is not.

<p>Last week, in a statement to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/index.html">UN Security Council</a>, Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-to-investigate-libya-war-crimes-committed-by-nato-ntc-forces.php">detailed the charges</a> [JURIST report] against al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam as well as what is being done to secure their capture. Late last month, the two reportedly attempted to leave Libya in an effort to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/gaddafi-son-intelligence-chief-reportedly-seeking-surrender-to-icc.php">surrender themselves</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC, according to the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website]. Earlier in the month, Ocampo said that he has evidence against Saif al-Islam for his role in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-has-evidence-against-gaddafi-son-for-planning-civilian-attacks.php">planning attacks on Libyan civilians</a> [JURIST report]. According to Ocampo, Saif al-Islam hired mercenaries to assist him in carrying out his plans to attack civilians that protested the rule of his father. The "substantial evidence" against Saif al-Islam is mostly in the form of witness reports, and the court remains in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-in-contact-with-gaddafis-son-over-possible-surrender.php">indirect contact</a> with him, where there has been talk of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-in-contact-with-gaddafis-son-over-possible-surrender.php">possible surrender</a> [JURIST reports]. The ability of the ICC to negotiate a possible surrender of Saif al-Islam is a result of his desire to avoid the fate of his father, who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">killed by opposition fighters</a> [JURIST report] in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mahmoudi's extradition is the latest legal episode in an ongoing effort by Libyan and international courts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">investigate officials in Gaddafi's government</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099314.pdf">issued arrest warrants</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">report</a>] for Gaddafi, as well as two high-ranking officials in his regime, for crimes against humanity. ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] declared before the Pre-Trial Chamber that his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">obtained direct evidence</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protesters and that his army used live ammunition on crowds, fired at people in funeral processions, and placed snipers to shoot people leaving mosques after prayer services. Earlier in June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend its investigation</a> [JURIST report] of human rights abuses in Libya.

UNJHRO reported 188 cases of human rights violations related to the electoral process during the period between November 2010 and September 2011. The fundamental rights that were violated by governmental officials such as the <a href="http://www.reformedelapnc.org/">National Congolese Police</a> (PNC) [official website] included freedom of expression, freedom of association, right to peaceful assembly, right to life and physical integrity, right to liberty, and security of person. Numerous incidents reported involved PNC agents threatening, beating or arresting civilian who were merely wearing T-shirts of opposition parties. Such violations also extended to journalists and human rights defenders related to the upcoming elections:<blockquote>The UNJHRO urges the Government to intensify its cooperation with civil society, to issue public messages calling for State agents, especially members of the security forces, to promote and respect human rights and to fight impunity of State agents responsible for human rights violations by holding them accountable. The UNJHRO calls upon the international community to step up its efforts to support the Government of the DRC, civil society, and other stakeholders in efforts to train security forces and judicial officers on fundamental freedoms. Political parties must also issue public statements promoting peaceful participation in the electoral process and specifically call upon their supporters, especially youth, to refrain from violence and incitement thereto, and to respect and promote national laws and public order.</blockquote>The UNJHRO is concerned that since the pre-electoral period was marked by violence involving human rights violations, the incidents of violence will increase as political activities intensifies. The upcoming election will be the second democratic election that the DRC will have after its first election in 2006.

<p>The DRC has faced numerous human rights violations in the past. In June, four policemen were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/congo-court-sentences-4-to-death-for-rights-activist-murder.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to death for killing a prominent human rights activist. In February, a military official and his subordinates were sentenced for <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">mass rape</a> [JURIST report] that occurred on New Year's Eve. In addition to human rights violations, the DRC faced some minor issues such as <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-arrests-six-election-officials.php">arresting</a> [JURIST report] six election officials for ballot fraud but there has been no violence related to election reported. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The briefs contend that the new law will "impede effective and consistent diplomatic relations," and encourage "an imminent threat of state-sanctioned bias or discrimination" of their citizens. The countries are also concerned about the detrimental effects the new law will have on trade and tourism. The briefs request that the court "preliminarily enjoin SB 20, and declare it unconstitutional in its entirety." The DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/us-v-sc-complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] claims that the new legislation, which allows police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest, and requires businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system, creates a patchwork of state and local immigration policies that conflict with the policies and principles of the federal government. The department is requesting an injunction barring certain portions of the state law that would take effect on January 1.The governments that filed briefs are: Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,  Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

<p>State responses to inadequate federal immigration law continue to create controversy. The South Carolina legislation was recently <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/complaint_final.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] by a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">coalition of civil rights groups</a> [JURIST report], including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and others who claim it invites racial profiling and interferes with federal law. The <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] denied similar motions for injunction against that state's recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-again-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">passed immigration law</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, the state of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">controversial immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], on which the South Carolina and Alabama legislation is modeled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The comments came as part of the secretary's message to the 13th Annual Conference on Protocol II. Congratulating the 97 States already party to Protocol II, the secretary reiterated his call to implement the Plan of Action to Promote the Universality of the Convention:<blockquote>Landmines, booby-traps and other explosive devices aggravate and prolong the horrendous consequences of armed conflict. Both during and after hostilities, they kill indiscriminately, maim vulnerable civilians and cause excessive, yet random, suffering of combatants. Since its inception, the Protocol has helped shape global efforts to eliminate that scourge. ... Furthermore, evidence provided years ago by members of the United Nations Mine Action Team indicates the need to strengthen international rules applicable to mines other than anti-personnel mines. ... Universalizing the Protocol remains as important as ever.</blockquote>Protocol II was amended in 1996, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40342&Cr=mines&Cr1=">expanding its application to international and domestic conflicts</a> [UN News Centre report] and banning the use of non-detectable anti-personnel mines as well as non-self-destructing and non-self-deactivating mines not in marked, fenced and monitored areas.  

<p>The call to universalize the treaty is not the first. In November 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-urges-us-to-join-landmine-treaty.php">urged the US to become a state party</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/mine/UNDocs/ban_trty.htm">Mine Ban Treaty</a> [text], repeating a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-groups-renew-calls-for-us-to.php">plea made in March</a> [JURIST report]. The calls came after the US <a href="http://www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] stated in November 2009 that the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-will-not-become-party-to-anti.php">US will not be signing the treaty</a> [JURIST report] to ban the use of anti-personnel landmines. In April 2007, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/un-sg-calls-for-universal-adherence-to.php">urged all countries to sign</a> [JURIST report] and abide by international treaties banning landmines International Mine Awareness Day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-224.pdf">National Meat Association v. Harris</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court considered where the federal regime of slaughterhouse regulation as established by the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_Policies/Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act/index.asp">Federal Meat Inspection Act</a> ("FMIA") [text], as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 and the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act preempted a subsequent California law imposing additional and arguably contrary requirements. The petitioner argued that "there is no way ... to say that California law can be interpreted in a way that will not tell a Federal slaughterhouse what to do and&#8212;and how to do it with respect to nonambulatory animals." The Solicitor General, in support of the petitioner, took a slightly different position on whether state regulations regarding the formation of sales contracts would also be preempted: "the ban on buying is nothing, is nothing but doing in two steps what the State clearly can't do in one step, which is tell slaughterhouses how they are to deal with an animal that is on their premises. At least they can't&#8212;States can't tell slaughterhouses how to do that when there is a Federal regulation on the subject. The respondent drew a line between the purpose of the federal regulation and the California statute:<blockquote>The scope are [sic] the mandates of Federal law dealing with the method, quality, and marketing of turning animals into meat for human consumption. ... None of the provisions are within the scope because California is not regulating animals that are going to be turned into meat. And the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the purpose of the act, the legislative history of the act show, that the scope of the act is concerned with animals that are going to become meat.</blockquote>The court seemed skeptical that there was no overlap in purpose whatsoever.  

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-879.pdf">Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp.</a> (RFPC) [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-decide.php">report</a>], the court considered whether state court products liability claims relating to the death of an individual exposed to asbestos were preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00020701----000-.html">Locomotive Inspection Act</a> (LIA) [49 USC &#167; 20701].  The petitioner was exposed and subsequently passed away after working on the braking system of trains which contained asbestos. Petitioner urged the court to construe the Inspection Act narrowly (as applying to the safety of locomotives in use on railroad lines and not applying to hazards to mechanics conducting repairs) because<blockquote>in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a conflict preemption regime in which if a State had a rule in place that rule would be permitted to survive unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued a regulation. And there has never been a regulation on asbestos. ... [W]hat [respondent is] seeking to do is to take the doctrine of implied field preemption, gain immunity from State law liability and not be subject to any Federal rules. And it's that proposition that is an extraordinary proposition of implied field preemption.</blockquote>The Solicitor General, supporting the petitioner, argued that LIA's application is limited by its own language which purports to regulate locomotives for safe use&#8212;"safe for use on the line"&#8212;on lines of interstate commerce. The respondent relied on Napier which construes the LIA as delegating exclusive authority to the DOT to "determine the design and the materials of locomotive equipment", even where a State may regulate for a different purpose, because the statute says safe for use on&#8212;"safe for use on the line." It's safe for use on lines of interstate commerce. In other words, "regulatory power is broader than purpose."  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nashiri is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/us/abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri-arraigned-in-uss-cole-bombing.html?_r=1">charged with war crimes</a> [NYT report] under the <a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/111/LegText/111_hr2647cr_txt.pdf#page=980">Military Commission Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF] relating to the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 which killed 17 men, the bombing of the MV Limburg in 2002 and a failed plot to attack an American warship, The Sullivans, in 2000. Nashiri declined to enter a plea Wednesday. Counsel for Nashiri apparently plans to argue that evidence is unreliable due to the torture Nashiri endured, is circumstantial and is hearsay. Even if Nashiri is convicted, his defense will likely argue that the death penalty is inappropriate because of the mitigating factor that he was tortured while in US custody. Nashiri allegedly endured being threatened with a power drill during a mock execution, having threats levied against mother and waterboarding while in US custody. The defense will also challenge the jurisdiction of the military commission. Military commissions are only permitted to try war crimes committed during armed conflict, but both the bombing of the USS Cole and the attempted bombing of The Sullivans occurred before the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization to Use Military Force</a> [text, PDF] after <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive]. Critics contend that Nashiri and other Guantanamo detainees should be <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-first/al-nashiri-case-will-high_b_1073815.html">tried in federal district court</a> [Huffington Post report] rather than military commissions because the federal courts do not have the jurisdictional issues and the relaxed evidentiary requirements that the military commissions have.

<p>Nashiri has been at the center of controversy for many years. In May, lawyers for Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">filed suit against Poland</a> [JURIST report] over his supposed torture in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in the country. In 2007, Nashiri declared that his confession to orchestrating the USS Cole bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-says-torture.php">elicited under torture</a> [JURIST report]. Nashiri, along with fellow militant <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/jamel-ahmed-mohammed-ali-al-badawi">Jamal al-Badawi</a> [FBI backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/yemeni-court-upholds-death-sentence-in.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] by a Yemeni court in 2004 for his role in the attack on the Cole.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ninth-circuit-vacates-dont-ask-dont-tell-ruling.php">overturned the lower court's ruling</a> [JURIST report] at the request of lawyers for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ), who argued that the recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ninth-circuit-vacates-dont-ask-dont-tell-ruling.php">Congressional repeal of DADT</a> had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-vacate-dont-ask-dont-tell-ruling.php">rendered the original court case moot</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="http://www.logcabin.org">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website], the gay rights group that sued over the policy, urged the appeals court to uphold the ruling to prevent the government from banning gay military service in the future:<blockquote>The panel's sweeping, and unnecessary, vacatur order eradicates over a dozen thoughtful district court rulings, including factual findings after a full bench trial. It not only condemns any future servicemember who may claim injury from an unconstitutional discharge under DADT to re-litigate the entire factual basis for this lawsuit, at an enormous cost in judicial resources, but it calls into public question the very validity of the proceedings below, which were held and concluded before the Repeal Act was enacted. Resolution of these issues is vital to public confidence in the adequacy, transparency, and correctness of the judicial process.</blockquote>The Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's decision on the grounds that "the Supreme Court and our court have repeatedly held that a case is moot when the challenged statute is repealed, expires, or is amended to remove the challenged language." The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">took effect on September 20</a> [JURIST report].

<p>In July, the Ninth Circuit had ruled that DADT would <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its scheduled repeal. The court effectively reiterated its order <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued the previous week</a> [JURIST report] in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certified</a> [JURIST report] DADT's repeal, scheduling the policy to end September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December. The DADT Repeal Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved by the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before.

The report, "Neither Rights Nor Security," details HRW's investigation into the actions of the Mexican military and police forces in confronting drug cartels and the escalation in violence that has occurred since President Felipe Calderon <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/national/article/Mexico-cracks-down-on-violence-1222154.php">declared war on organized crime</a> [AP report] in 2006. The investigation began two years ago with HRW sending investigators to five of Mexico's most violent states. In the course of their investigation, HRW found evidence of security forces committing "170 cases of torture, 39 'disappearances,' and 24 extrajudicial killings." HRW summarized its findings:<blockquote>What we have found is a public security policy that is badly failing on two fronts. It has not succeeded in reducing violence. Instead, it has resulted in a dramatic increase in grave human rights violations, virtually none of which appear to be adequately investigated. In sum, rather than strengthening public security in Mexico, Calderon "war" has exacerbated a climate of violence, lawlessness, and fear in many parts of the country.</blockquote>HRW claims that not only have the security forces been committing these rights abuses, but that the government has failed to adequately investigate claims of abuse. In addition, the report notes that these rights abuses not only undermine the rule of law, but can also be counterproductive to the operation by causing an escalation of violence and a loss of legitimacy in the eyes of the public.

<p>The HRW report comes in response to widespread violence in Mexico in the fight against drug cartels. This is not the first time the security forces have been accused of committing rights abuses. In August, Mexico's <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, in Spanish] issued a <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/fuentes/documentos/Recomendaciones/Generales/019.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] contending that military and law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mexico-human-rights-body-alleges-regular-police-misconduct.php">routinely conducted illegal searches</a> [JURIST report].

The court <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgo3FB4fDDAPY-XfdkIoOljd35ZA?docId=d4b45d353ed8431f92acab7488988e27">rejected</a> [AP article]
Katsav's appeal of his conviction for rape, sexual abuse and sexual harassment, finding that he misused his position as president, from which he was forced to resign after the allegations were made public. The unanimous decision by the three-judge panel ended the ordeal that began in 2006. Katsav has consistently denied the charges, and his lawyer took issue with the court's decision, calling into question the credibility of the victim's testimony. The confirmation of the conviction is seen widely in Israel as a victory for women's rights and an enticement for rape victims to come forward. Katsav is expected to begin serving his seven-year sentence December 7, although his lawyers said they would study the ruling and decide whether to seek another trial before a different Supreme Court panel.

<p>Katsav's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/israel-ex-president-begins-appeal-before-high-court.php">appeal began</a> in August after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-appeals-rape-conviction-to-high-court.php">submitted a 300-page document</a> [JURIST reports] following his conviction and sentencing. His sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-prison-sentence-delayed-pending-appeal.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] in May pending the outcome of this decision. Katsav was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-israel-president-convicted-of-rape.php">convicted</a> in December 2010 after rejected a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">plea bargain</a> [JURIST reports].

[JURIST] A Brazilian federal court ruled Wednesday that work on a <a href="http://belo-monte.com/">dam</a> [Belo Monte backgrounder] being constructed on the Xingu River in the Amazon jungle may continue. The <a href="http://www.trf1.jus.br/">Federal Court of the First Region</a> [official website, in Portuguese] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/brazil-judge-blocks-amazon-jungle-dam-construction.php">ordered that dam construction cease</a> [JURIST report] until indigenous groups are consulted and given access to environmental impact reports, but the court <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9QTDE1O1.htm">reversed that decision in a 2-1 vote</a> [AP report], upholding the decree issued by Para state authorizing the dam's construction. Maria do Carmo Cardoso, a court judge, held that the indigenous communities are entitled to be consulted, but the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvuxZfyZs0sBsBi8FyWEVisO2I7A?docId=CNG.209ec9a2ad059c4ffb6b615044e67c53.b51">law does not say that this must be done before approval of the work</a> [AFP report]. When completed the $11 billion, 11,000-megawatt dam will be the world's third largest behind China's Three Gorges dam and the Itaipu, which straddles the border of Brazil and Paraguay. The project is expected to employ 20,000 people directly in construction, flood an area of 500 square kilometers (200 square miles) along the Xingu river and displace 16,000 persons. Environmentalists and indigenous groups say the dam will devastate wildlife and the livelihoods of as many as 40,000 people who live in the area to be flooded. The government says the dam will provide clean, renewable energy and is essential to fuel the South American country's growing economy. The federal prosecutors' office in Para plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

Last month JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.caplaw.com.br/index.php?id=24">Pedro Sousa</a> [official profile, in Portuguese] of Carneiro de Almeida &amp; Pires Advogados <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2011/10/belo-monte-dam-violates-constitutional-environmental-obligations/">wrote</a> [JURIST comment] that the Belo Monte dam violates the constitutional mandate to protect indigenous peoples and the environment. In September the Malaysian <a href="http://202.75.7.131/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=33&amp;lang=enhttp://202.75.7.131/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=33&amp;lang=en">Federal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-court-rules-against-indigenous-people-in-land-rights-suit.php">unanimously ruled against indigenous people</a> [JURIST report] challenging a similar hydroelectric dam. The indigenous people argued that they received inadequate compensation for the Sarawak government's seizure of their land to build the dam. The judges stated that if the plaintiffs were not satisfied with the amount of compensation then that is a matter for arbitration, not for the court. In December 2010 the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">pledged to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [JURIST report], a non-binding UN treaty expressing support for the rights of indigenous peoples. The US was the last member to lend its support to the treaty. In August of that year UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the living conditions of indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report] and support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.]]></content:encoded>

The vote was split along party lines, with 10 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation and eight Republicans voting in opposition. Committee Chair Patrick Leahy emphasized that the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> (ROMA) [text] would guarantee equal treatment for all lawful marriages and extend federal benefits to same-sex couples even if they move into states that do not recognize same-sex marriage. ROMA has also <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2011/11/10/breaking-senate-panel-approves-doma-repeal-legislation/">garnered support</a> [<em>Washington Blade</em> report] from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] who has also decried DOMA as discriminatory, pledging he would continue to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">fight for its repeal</a> [JURIST report]. In an attempt by Democrats to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_19304813?source=commented-">send a message to their political base</a> [AP report], the bill may proceed to the Senate floor, but is likely to fail because it has significantly fewer co-sponsors than is needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. It is also unlikely that the repeal legislation will pass the Republican-controlled <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website]. <a href="http://www.couragecampaign.org/">Courage Campaign</a> [advocacy website] chair and founder Rick Jacobs <a href="http://www.couragecampaign.org/press/681/in-historic-move-the-senate-judiciary-committee-votes-to-repeal-the-defense-of-marriage-act-doma">thanked the Judiciary Committee</a> [press release] for their vote. Meanwhile, national polls suggest that a slight majority of Americans favor allowing same-sex couples to marry.  

<p>Members of the House of Representatives Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group defended DOMA in a <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/login.htm">filing</a> [text, PDF] in October in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. The group contends that DOMA "easily passes the rational basis test," which would apply because "sexual orientation is not a suspect or quasi-suspect class under the traditional factors used to determine such classes" including immutability and political powerlessness. Even though the Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">stopped defending the constitutionality of DOMA</a> [JURIST report], benefits continue to be denied. Last month, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">disabled Navy veteran filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the Court of Appeals for <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Veterans Claims</a> [official website] for denying her partner a share of her disability benefits under DOMA. Carmen Cardona filed for veterans' spousal benefits last year but was denied. The <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> [official website] reportedly told her she could not receive benefits because her spouse was a woman, which is not a recognized marriage under federal law. In February, congressional Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sanader <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE7A225L20111103?sp=true">stands accused</a> [Reuters report] of corruption, abuse of power and fraud for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">taking nearly &#8364;4 million</a> [JURIST report] from public firms and state institutions in the 1990s, charges which he has denied.

<p>Sanader's trial is the first criminal proceeding prompted by EU pressure for Croatia to crack down on corruption. Sanader's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/trial-postponed-for-former-croatia-pm.php">trial was postponed</a> [JURIST report] last month for health reasons. Elected to parliament after he stepped down from the prime minister position in 2009, Sanader was indicted in September as part of an anti-corruption campaign launched his hand-picked successor <a href="http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/clanovi_vlade/jadranka_kosor_dipl_iur">Jadranka Kosor</a> [official profile]. Croatia is close to achieving membership in the European Union (EU), and Kosor hopes Sanader's trial will help ease pressure from Brussels for Croatia to sort out corruption and speed investigations. Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/Austria-extradites-Croatia-ex-PM-to-face-corruption-charges.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to Croatia in July in order to face these charges after he was arrested in Austria last December. Sanader had argued that it would be impossible to receive a fair trial in Croatia, but he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">dropped his stance after media speculation</a> [JURIST report] suggested the appeal could harm EU Croatia's accession. The Kosor government completed accession talks with the EU in June, and is hoping to join in July 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama</span>, overturning the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo-detainees-habeas-petition.php">release order</a> [JURIST report] for Yemeni Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/156-allal-ab-aljallil-abd-al-rahman/documents/8/pages/879#36">Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif</a> [NYT profile]. The redaction at times covers entire sections, but reveals strong divisions between the deciding judges. The unredacted portion of the majority opinion largely focuses on the district court's failure to afford the evidence of the government&#8212;intelligence reports&#8212;a presumption of regularity. The majority opines there is confusion over the application of the presumption stemming from:<blockquote>the fact that intelligence reports involve two distinct actors&#8212;the non-government source and the government official who summarizes (or transcribes) the source's statement. The presumption of regularity pertains only to the second: it presumes the government official accurately identified the source and accurately summarized his statement, but it implies nothing about the truth of the underlying non-government source's statement. ... The presumption of regularity&#8212;to the extent it is not rebutted&#8212;requires a court to treat the Government's record as accurate; it does not compel a determination that the record establishes what it is offered to prove.</blockquote>The majority asserts the presumption is provided for in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-1195.ZS.html">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion text] and regularly applied by courts in the context of federalism. In the absence of an explicit finding of credibility regarding Latif's "plausible alternative story" by the district court judge, the presumption stood firm. In sharp contrast, the dissent accuses the majority of deviating from a "highly deferential clear error review" and in evaluating the evidence (which it finds unreliable), it "moves the goal posts" by applying a "new presumption and then proceeding to find that it has not been rebutted." This, the dissent asserts, eviscerates the "meaningful opportunity" guaranteed by <span class="casename">Boumediene</span>. The case was remanded to district court to reconsider the evidence in light of the "presumptively reliable government evidence."  

<p>Federal courts have struggled with <em>habeas corpus</em> rights for Guantanamo detainees. In May, the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-denies-habeas-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's decision that Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainee Musa'ab Omar al-Madhwani is lawfully detained for being part of al Qaeda. In March, the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-overturns-release-order-for-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's decision granting release to Yemeni Guantanamo detainee Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman. In September 2010, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief, but the Supreme Court turned down his appeal in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Mahmoudi, who served under <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], has been held in Tunisia since September when he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-ex-pm-arrested-in-tunisia.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] while attempting to illegally enter Tunisia. Earlier this month the Tunisian courts announced they would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">review a request</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] to extradite al-Mahmoudi back to Libya in order to face possible charges of corruption. A Tunisian appellate court ruled earlier this week that al-Mahmoudi <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-court-orders-extradition-of-former-libya-pm.php">should be extradited back to Libya</a> [JURIST report], despite concerns expressed by his lawyer for his safety. HRW stated that because Tunisia ratified the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm#art3">1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [materials] they are subject to its terms, including Article 3, which prohibits the extradition of suspects to countries where torture is a real possibility. According to HRW, the NTC cannot guarantee al-Mahmoudi's safety due to their lack of adequate control over security forces and Libyian detention facilities. HRW cited examples of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/30/libya-cease-arbitrary-arrests-abuse-detainees">recently documented cases of mistreatment</a> [HRW report] in Libyan detention facilities as examples of what al-Mahmoudi could face if he is returned to Libya. HRW further asserts that because the NTC has yet to establish a functioning judicial system, al-Mahmoudi would not be guaranteed basic rights of due process. In order for al-Mahmoudi's extradition to be effective, Tunisia's president must sign a decree ordering his return to Libya. Al-Mahmoudi could contest that order through the administrative process, but the extradition would still take place. 

<p>Al-Mahmoudi's extradition is the latest legal episode in an ongoing effort by Libyan and international courts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">investigate officials in Gaddafi's government</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099314.pdf">issued arrest warrants</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">report</a>] for Gaddafi, as well as two high-ranking officials in his regime, for crimes against humanity. ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] declared before the Pre-Trial Chamber that his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">obtained direct evidence</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protesters and that his army used live ammunition on crowds, fired at people in funeral processions, and placed snipers to shoot people leaving mosques after prayer services. Earlier in June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend its investigation</a> [JURIST report] of human rights abuses in Libya. In a 92-page <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.44_AUV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], the UNHRC declared that Gaddafi's regime committed murder, rape, torture, and forced disappearance "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Enock Nsubuga confessed to the January 2011 killing, admitting to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7AA07020111111">beating Kato</a> [Reuters report] with a hammer at his home before he died on the way to the hospital. Nsubuga claimed that he attacked Kato in response to sexual advances he made. The case sparked worldwide criticism and drew attention to gay rights in Uganda. Homosexuality remains a controversial issue in much of Africa, with 37 countries in the continent, including Uganda, having laws making homosexuality illegal. Uganda has been harshly criticized throughout the international community since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8308912.stm">introduction</a> [BBC report] in October 2009 of its <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">Anti-Homosexuality Bill</a> [text, PDF], which stalled in the Parliament. The legislation would have made "aggravated homosexuality" punishable by death. In Uganda, it is a common belief that homosexuality is both un-Christian and un-African. 

<p>In January, the Ugandan High Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uganda-high-court-rules-anti-gay-newspaper-article-violated-constitutional-rights.php">issued a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] and awarded damages to plaintiffs who were alleged to be homosexuals by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper, The <em>Rolling Stone</em>. The complaint was filed by <a href="http://www.ugandans4rights.org/index.php">Uganda's Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of three members who, along with 97 other individuals, were alleged to be homosexuals in an article published by the tabloid under the headline "Hang Them" in October 2010. In January 2010, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">discriminatory</a> [JURIST report] and could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. Additionally, in February, US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report], which would implement harsh punishments for homosexual behavior, including the death penalty in some circumstances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While three of the four defendants pleaded guilty and received reduced sentences, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/calvin_gibbs/index.html">Sgt. Calvin Gibbs</a> [NYT profile], 26, was given a life sentence for 15 convictions including murder, assault and conspiracy connected to the killing of three men not long after he took over the Fifth Brigade of the <a href="http://www.usarmy.com/">US Army</a> [official website] Second Division in Afghanistan's Kandahar province in November 2009. Gibbs admitted to cutting and keeping fingers from the corpses as trophies, but claimed that he was merely returning enemy fire and was not motivated to kill. Prosecutors, however, relied on Gibbs' own likening of collecting amputated body parts to the antlers of a deer  to characterize the platoon leader as a hunter who killed Afghans "for sport." Two co-defendants testified against their former leader, and told the court that Gibbs not only collected fingers and teeth from those he called "savages," but that he also took pictures next to the victims before leaving weapons around their bodies. While Gibbs has been given a life sentence, the court also granted the possibility of parole after less than 10 years. 

<p>Although the "kill team" incident has been considered one of the worst examples of American war crimes since the start of the Afghanistan campaign, other crimes have been alleged. In September 2010, former UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philip+Alston">Philip Alston</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-un-rights-expert-urges-afghanistan-war-crimes-investigation.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct by both Taliban and US and British military forces, and expressed particular concern over the number of civilian deaths during the war in Afghanistan.

The DRC is expected to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on November 28. The prosecutor's statement follows a UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHRO_HRElectionsReport_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] published earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/drc-urged-to-prevent-rights-violations-linked-to-electoral-process.php">encouraging an end to election violence</a>[JURIST report]. The report, published by the<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Joint Human Rights Office</a> (UNJHRO) [official website] alleges that 188 cases of human rights violations related to the electoral process have occurred in the last year. Moreno-Ocampo indicated that it was important to encourage a peaceful electoral process in the DRC and to prosecute offenders. He stated that his office is investigating the alleged violence and will prosecute those who perpetrate violence:<blockquote>We are keeping watch to ensure that the process does not lead to acts of violence or attacks against the civilian population. We are paying particular attention to reports of inciting hatred, exclusion and physical violence by various political figures in Kinshasa and across the entire country. Electoral violence can result in the commission of crimes falling within our jurisdiction. No one should doubt our resolve to prevent crimes or, if need be, prosecute individuals, as we are doing in Kenya and Cote Ivoire.</blockquote>The prosecutor expressed a resolve to investigate all those responsible for election violence regardless of political affiliation. Daniel Ngoy Mulunda, the head of Congo's election commission, said the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7AA0CJ20111111?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">ICC is welcome to monitor electoral procedures</a> [Reuters report] and investigate any violence in the electoral process. 

<p>The DRC has faced numerous accusations of human rights violations in the past. In June, four policemen were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/congo-court-sentences-4-to-death-for-rights-activist-murder.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to death for killing a prominent human rights activist. In February, a military official and his subordinates were sentenced for <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">mass rape</a> [JURIST report] that occurred on New Year's Eve. In addition to human rights violations, the DRC faced some minor issues such as <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-arrests-six-election-officials.php">arresting</a> [JURIST report] six election officials for ballot fraud but there has been no violence related to election reported. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to HRW, Homs, a governorate with some of the strongest anti-government leanings, has become "a microcosm of the Syrian government's brutality." HRW estimates security forces have killed more than 3,100 protesters in an effort to silence the movement. In addition to killings, the report offers evidence that Syrian forces have engaged in forced disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention. Violence in Syria continues despite reaching an agreement earlier this month with the Arab League to take measures to end the violence. The <a href="http://www.cfr.org/middle-east/arab-league/p25967">Arab League</a> [CFR backgrounder] is scheduled to have an emergency meeting on November 12 to discuss the issue of Syria breaking the agreement. HRW is recommending that the Arab League suspend Syria as a consequence of failing to abide by the agreement. HRW further recommends:<blockquote>the Syrian government immediately to halt the use of excessive and lethal force by security forces against unarmed demonstrators and activists ... and to provide immediate and unhindered access to human rights groups and journalists to the governorate of Homs, including hospitals, places of detention, and prisons [and that] the United Nations Security Council to take action, separately and jointly, to protect civilians by pushing for international civilian observers to deploy inside Syria, including in Homs Governorate in order to monitor human rights violations.</blockquote>HRW argues that the international response to the situation has been inadequate so far, but taking these measures would be a step in the right direction.

<p>Earlier this week, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] announced that the death toll of Syrian protesters has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-right-office-syria-death-toll-exceeds-3500.php">exceeded 3,500</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-syria-announces-amnesty-for.php">offered amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to any protester who surrendered themselves. In October, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11493&LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] the international community to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-international-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">protect civilian lives in Syria</a> [JURIST report]. The violence has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-arab-league-denounce-syria-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] by both the UN and the Arab League. Fighting is not limited to the Homs region&#8212;HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/06/01/syria-crimes-against-humanity-daraa">released a report</a> [HRW report] in June of this year detailing rights abuses in the Daraa Governorate. There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. In April, Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Limaj allegedly ordered two captured Serb policemen executed and tortured another Serbian captive in 1999. Limaj is also under investigation for embezzling funds while serving as transport minister. The senior politician, along with eight other other defendants who also pleaded not guilty, was taken into the Pristina District Court <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/633c954da7d9434f9de7ed15f38075aa/Article_2011-11-11-EU-Kosovo-War-Crimes/id-a9b6e710c23b47c3b4b909ec3bd08bcc">under tight security measures</a> [AP report] early Friday morning, where he will be tried in front of two EU judges and one Kosovo judge. Though much of the prosecution's case relied upon a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who was <a href="http://arabnews.com/world/article532326.ece">found hanged</a> [Reuters report] in September in an apparent suicide, the trial is expected to conclude early next year.  

<p>The <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website] has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008. An influential figure in the ruling <a href="http://www.pdk49.com/index.php?page=1,1">Democratic Party of Kosovo</a> (PDK) [official website, in Albanian], Limaj was excluded from a cabinet position following international pressure not to include corrupt officials, but was elected into the Kosovo parliament. Limaj is an ex-member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and is viewed as a liberator by many ethnic Albanians. In 2005, Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. An EU judge in September <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-judge-places-senior-kosovo-politician-under-house-arrest-on-suspicion-of-war-crimes.php">placed Limaj under house arrest</a> [JURIST report] while awaiting trial.

The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld an injunction</a> in April before the law ever took effect, and Arizona is now <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asking the high court</a> [JURIST reports] to address whether the state law is preempted by federal immigration legislation. While the state maintains that the Ninth Circuit incorrectly concluded that the state law was facially preempted and "declined to determine whether there were constitutional applications" of the Arizona immigration legislation, the DOJ insists the courts <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/11/10/govt_asks_justices_to_stay_out_of_immigration_case/">properly blocked</a> [AP report] the provisions. SB 1070, which criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in April of last year.

<p>This request is part of a long line of legal challenges to the Arizona law. Earlier this month, advocacy groups filed suit in the US District Court for the District of Arizona asking a federal judge to <a href="/2011/11/arizona-day-laborer-law-challenged.php">block enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the portion of the state's controversial immigration law that bans blocking traffic to acquire or offer day labor services. Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-dismisses-arizona-counterclaim-over-immigration-law.php">dismissed a counterclaim</a> [JURIST report] filed by <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Arizona Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] and state <a href="http://www.azag.gov/bio.html">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official profile] against the US government in the lawsuit challenging the controversial Arizona immigration law. In a preview of how it might rule should it decide to hear the case, the Supreme Court in May <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-115.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v.

Just over two years after Ban instituted the internal justice system, its judges have charged the UN chief with attempting to limit their powers and "undermine the integrity of the Tribunal and its independence" through his recommendations outlined in an August 8 <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/11/11/bans-report/">report</a> [text] to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> (GA) [official website]. Ban's review outlined several procedural changes to the operations of the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/oaj/dispute/">Dispute Tribunal</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/en/oaj/appeals/">Appeals Tribunal</a> [official websites], prompting a response from the judges in an open <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/11/11/undt-complaint-about-ban/">missive</a> [text] to the GA on October 10. One of the Ban's contentious proposals is to suspend the Dispute Tribunal's ability to enforce interlocutory orders while the judgments are being appealed to the to the Appeals Tribunal, the UN's highest judicial body. The judges claim such a change would render the court toothless and "enable either party [to a dispute] to paralyze the [case management] process, thus preventing the Dispute Tribunal from the speedy and cost-efficient disposal of cases for which it has been praised by the General Assembly." Also disputed is Ban's proposal to remove the Tribunals' appellate power over decisions of the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/oaj/unjs/resource.shtml">Ethics Offices</a> [materials] and the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/oios/">Office of Internal Oversight Services</a> [official website]. A Washington-based organization that protects organizational dissidents, the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/index.php">Government Accountability Project</a> (GAP) [official website; <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/31-2010/1581-united-nations-dispute-tribunal-judges-voice-opposition-to-secretary-generals-proposal-support-whistleblowers-">report</a>], was heavily involved in the original design of the UN's whistleblower protection rules and stated this week that Ban's proposal "would result in UN whistleblowers having little recourse when they are subjected to retaliation and would effectively render whistleblower protections at the United Nations meaningless." GAP observed that over 99 percent of retaliation cases reviewed by the Ethics Offices resulted in no substantiation for the whistleblowers involved. Also contained in Ban's report are requests for a $1 million increase in the internal justice system budget and 26 additional support staff for the judges, as well as the creation of a mechanism to deal with complaints against the judges themselves.

<p>The tribunals were authorized in 2007, pursuant to GA <a href="http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-62-228.pdf">resolution 62/228</a> [text, PDF]. The Appeals Tribunal is charged with appellate review of decisions of the Dispute Tribunal, which hears grievance and discipline disputes between UN members. Judges were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-appoints-judges-to-new-internal.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] in 2009, including one American judge, <a href="http://www.judgepainter.org/">Mark Painter</a> [personal website]. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2008/080724_Justice.doc.htm">Internal Justice Council</a> (IJC) [UN backgrounder] was responsible for advising the GA on appropriate judges for the two tribunals. The IJC was formed in 2007 following an independent review of UN internal justice procedures. The two-tiered tribunal system was also one of the suggestions put forth by the independent "Redesign Panel" convened in 2006 at the behest of the GA after then-secretary general Kofi Annan had called the UN's internal justice system slow and cumbersome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Refugees in the camp <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15700483">claimed to witness</a> [BBC report] an Antonov plane, often used by northern <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/820864.stm">Sudan</a> [BBC backgrounder] as a makeshift bomber, circling the camp and then making two bombing runs, reportedly dropping five bombs, of which four exploded. Pillay noted that the information available at the time suggested that the bombing may amount to an international crime or serious human rights violation. Pillay expressed alarm about the fighting and indiscriminate attacks that continue to take place just across the border in Sudan's Southern Kordofan region, violence which has spilled over into neighboring states, including those in South Sudan:<blockquote>This latest attack risks aggravating what is already an extremely tense and dangerous situation. ... The camp at Yida, which is close to the border with Sudan, is housing thousands of civilians, including women and children. ... There needs to be an independent, thorough and credible investigation to establish the precise circumstances of this aerial bombing, and if indeed it is established that an international crime or serious human rights violation has been committed, then those responsible should be brought to justice.</blockquote>Many suspect that the bombing raid order came from Khartoum, but a Sudan Armed Forces spokesman vehemently denied any links to the raid. South Kordofan remains a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan due to the region's extensive oil reserves.

<p>The Republic of South Sudan was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">recognized as an independent country</a> [JURIST report] in July, making it the world's 193rd nation. In February, Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>], who campaigned against secession, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sudan-president-accepts-southern-sudans-vote-for-independance.php">issued a formal decree</a> [JURIST report] accepting the result of the referendum. However, tensions between the newly independent country and Sudan remain high. Much of the recent violence stems from action in the South Kordofan region between Sudanese troops and troops loyal to South Sudan's army. In June a UN official <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-criticizes-sudan-for-human-rights-abuses.php">denounced continued human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against civilians in the region. The UN Under-Secretary-General for <a href="http://www.un.org/en/humanitarian/">Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=145">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] said that the UN knows of more than 70,000 people who have been displaced by the conflict, many of whom are subject to violence and targeting due to their ethnic heritage. Additionally, the UN reported that several <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38798&Cr=Kordofan&Cr1=">peacekeepers had been held and tortured</a> [UN News Centre report] in the region, and that those providing humanitarian relief are vulnerable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20111111/168598603.html">new charges allege</a> [RIA Novosti report] that during her time as head of United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) in 1996, Tymoshenko hid $165 million of corporate revenue and accumulated $5.8 million through tax fraud. Tymoshenko <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/four-new-charges-against-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">received notice of the charges</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week. Last month, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/sbu/control/en/index">Security Service of Ukraine</a> [official website] brought <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-facing-new-charges.php">new corruption charges</a> against Tymoshenko days after she was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to seven years in prison on charges of abuse of power and corruption. Serhiy Vlasenko, Tymoshenko's lawyer also announced on Thursday that her official <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/653v29nx">appeal</a> [press release] will be heard on December 13.

<p>Tymoshenko's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-prosecutors-seek-7-year-sentence-for-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">resumed</a> at the end of September after a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-trial-delayed.php">two-week recess</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Judge Rodoin Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into UESU, an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych.

In an open letter to Sein published in three state-owned newspapers, the MNHRC indicated that domestic and international support would follow the prisoners' release. Sein had granted amnesty to 6,359 prisoners in October following a similar open letter issued by the MNHRC. MNHRC Chairman Win Mra called for the release of the political prisoners and recommended that Sein transfer certain prisoners to prisons closer to their families:<blockquote>The release of the remaining prisoners, including those cited above convicted for breach of existing laws who do not pose a threat to the stability of State and public tranquility, in the interest of national races, will not only enable them to participate in whatever way they can in the nation-building tasks but also will in a way help promote national unity. Accordingly, the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission again humbly requests the President as a reflection of his magnanimity to include those prisoners when a subsequent amnesty is granted. If for reasons of maintaining peace and stability, certain prisoners cannot as yet be included in the amnesty, the Commission would like to respectfully submit that consideration be made for transferring them to prisons with easy access for their family members.</blockquote>The MNHRC estimates that there are 500 prisoners of conscience in Myanmar custody, while other estimates reach 2,000. Some sources suggest that <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/11/13/2500068/new-plea-made-to-free-myanmar.html">amnesty will be granted</a> [AP report] to the prisoners as early as Monday.

<p>In October, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5604">welcomed</a> [statement] the release of political prisoners by Myanmar's president, while <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-urged-to-release-remaining-political-prisoners.php">urging the government to release all political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] in accordance with the rule of law. Days earlier, US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that Myanmar's civilian-led government was planning dramatic changes including <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-to-free-hundreds-of-political-prisoners.php">releasing hundreds of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and consequential dialogue with pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. Myanmar has sought to improve its international reputation following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">formed the MNHRC</a> [JURIST report] in September to promote and safeguard the country's constitutional rights. In August, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">urged the government of Myanmar to investigate human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and improve its rights record. In May, Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-releasing-nearly-15000-prisoners-after-un-visit.php">began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN's Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Mendez, has doubts as to whether the proposed inquiry will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/13/un-fears-british-torture-inquiry">meet international standards</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], while other human rights organizations criticize it because of its requirement that disclosures be made only with governmental approval. Additionally, the inquiry is powerless to compel witnesses or the release of relevant documents, and it provides no status in the proceedings for individuals alleging to be victims of UK torture. The combination of secrecy and limited power has led many to wonder if it will be effective in determining whether torture and other violations of human rights were committed by security services. The panel charged with <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">completing the inquiry</a> [JURIST report] was created by UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] in July. The need for the inquiry arose after 12 ex-detainees brought civil cases against the government, claiming that British agents took part in their mistreatment while they were held in prisons in foreign countries, including Pakistan and Morocco. 

<p>In September, a three-year probe into abuse of military detainees in Iraq was finalized with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-inquiry-iraq-citizens-death-result-of-abuse-by-soldiers.php">release of a report</a> [JURIST report] that found numerous British soldiers were involved in specific episodes of abuse of Iraqi citizens. The independent inquiry was led by retired judge William Gage and focused on the detention of 10 Iraqis arrested at a hotel in 2003 on suspicion of insurgency. One man, Baha Mousa, died in custody from what was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEr_5gAfX66kmiGulgGRzNQ2BuHg?docId=CNG.94ba3b4dec5c0a90ff564448b4357a1f.351">concluded</a> [AFP report] to be a combination of soldier-inflicted injuries and a generally weakened state resulting from his detention. Mousa and the other Iraqi detainees were hooded, handcuffed and held in stress positions by the British soldiers and were subjected to a series of violent assaults. Mousa, a father of two, served as the hotel's receptionist and died about 36 hours after being detained, sustaining 93 separate injuries including fractured ribs and a broken nose. Although the use of hooding and painful stress positions was banned by the British government in 1972, Gage found a lack of knowledge of this prohibition, which he reportedly blamed on "corporate failure" by the UK's <a href="http://www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/home">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website]. The report also accused other soldiers of having knowledge of the abuse but not the "moral courage" to report the incidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111411zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in three separate cases, reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. The court agreed to hear two hours of arguments on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate issue in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-398%20Cert%20Petititon.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The court will consider Issue 1, which asks, "whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact the minimum coverage provision." The court also directed parties to brief and argue the question of whether the challenge to PPACA is barred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [26 USC &#167; 7421(a)], reserving one hour for argument on that issue. The court consolidated the cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-393%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-400%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will hear 90 minutes of oral argument on the question of whether the individual mandate provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. Finally, the court will hear one hour of oral argument on the question of Medicaid expansion&#8212;Issue 1 in <span class="casename">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>: "Does Congress exceed its enumerated powers and violate basic principles of federalism when it coerces States into accepting onerous conditions that it could not impose directly by threatening to withhold all federal funding under the single largest grant-in-aid program...?"

<p>All three cases that the court agreed to hear arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in August that the individual mandate is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional but severable</a> [JURIST report], upholding the rest of the law. The court took no action on an appeal by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">Thomas More Law Center</a> of a Sixth Circuit ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upholding the individual mandate</a> [JURIST reports]. The court also did not act on appeals by <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/virginia-appeals-health-care-dismissal-to-supreme-court.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php">Liberty University</a> of two Fourth Circuit rulings which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed their challenges for lack of standing</a> [JURIST reports]. Last week, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/DC-Circuit-upholds-constitutionality-of-health-care-law.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of PPACA.</p>

<p>Also Monday, the court granted <em>certiorari</em> in two other cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-159.htm">Astrue v. Capato</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pet_Astrue.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will rule on whether a child who was conceived after the death of a biological parent, but who cannot inherit personal property from that biological parent under applicable state intestacy law, is eligible for child survivor benefits under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_42_10_7_20_II.html">Title II of the Social Security Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 401 et seq.]. There is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-benefits-for-child-conceived-after-fathers-death.php">circuit split</a> [JURIST report] on the issue. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-161.htm">Armour v. Indianapolis</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.robbinsrussell.com/pdf/624.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether the Equal Protection Clause precludes a local taxing authority from refusing to refund payments made by those who have paid their assessments in full, while forgiving the obligations of identically situated taxpayers who chose to pay over a multi-year installment plan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed reforms include a limit on the number of terms a president can serve, the creation of the office of vice president and a provision allowing the current president to pick his successor, as well as the removal of an existing age limit on the presidential office. While the county's government has <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7AC07A20111113?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">called the reform democratic</a> [Reuters report], opponents of the referendum have criticized the move as a grab for power by President Teodoro Obiang. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/11/equatorial-guinea-move-consolidate-power">joint statement</a> [text], <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.egjustice.org/">EG Justice</a> [advocacy websites] said the constitutional changes "will strengthen the near-absolute powers of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and further deprive citizens of their civil and political rights." They sharply criticized the provision allowing the president to choose his vice president, arguing that the change would allow Obiang "to hand-pick his successor and to retain significant political influence even after he leaves office." The final official vote count on the referendum is expected sometime Tuesday. 

<p>Equatorial Guinea has been criticized by international human rights groups in the past. In August 2010, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/execution-four-men-equatorial-guinea-condemned-2010-08-23">condemned the execution</a> [press release] of four men <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/equatorial-guinea-defends-executions-over-2009-coup-plot.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of attempting to assassinate Obiang during a 2009 attack on the presidential palace. Denouncing the government's judicial procedures, AI reported that these men were convicted after an unfair trial, sentenced to death and executed without having an opportunity to appeal their sentence. AI urged Equatorial Guinea to put an end to the abductions, torture and executions it carries out in the name of justice. Obiang <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/equatorial-guinea-president-says-coup-plotters-had-fair-trial.php">defended</a> [JURIST news report] the trial and execution of the four men. He stated that the country's laws were respected, and procedures guaranteeing a legal, open and fair trial, including the guarantee of defense counsel, were followed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The presidents warned of the difficulties in retaining staff at the ICTY and the ICTR because both tribunals are nearing the end of their work and employees are leaving for more permanent jobs. ICTY Judge Patrick Robinson told the General Assembly that while the ICTY has made considerable progress in conducting the trials of war criminals, the process is greatly impeded by the "alarming rate" at which tribunal staff is resigning and the large burdens that are left for the remaining staff. ICTR Judge Khalida Rachid Khan also spoke the General Assembly of the challenges the ICTR faces with many of its employees leaving while also attempting to evade an "impunity gap." Khan reported that while the ICTR has tried and convicted many individuals, there is still unfinished work that must be completed to ensure that all war criminals are held accountable. The most critical issue remaining in the ICTR is the need to capture the nine remaining at-large fugitives, three of whom are among the most high-ranking accused, in order to send the message to the international community that "evading justice is not an option." The tribunal presidents proposed a retention incentive measure in an effort to maintain staff levels.

<p>While each tribunal has successfully tried and convicted numbers of war criminals since its inception, there are still many key trials pending. Serbian general <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>] is being held pending his trial at The Hague following his May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] after 16 years on the run. He is charged with committing war crimes during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive] and the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] where 8,000 people were killed. Croation Serb rebel leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10733">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in June, is also being held at The Hague pending his trial also on charges of war crimes committed during the Bosnian civil war and Srebrenica massacre. Rwandan genocide suspect and former Hutu militia leader Bernard Munyagishari is awaiting trial at the ICTR for charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape. He is alleged to have recruited, trained and led a militia group that killed and raped Tutsi women during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwandan+Genocide">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, most of the officials who joined other parties or plan to run independently are now allowed to continue their campaigns for the election that will begin on November 28. Parties and political forces had <a href="http://www.ahram.org.eg/Al-Mashhad-Al-Syiassy/News/112641.aspx">demanded</a> [Al Ahram report, in Arabic] the implementation of rule of law and urged the court to prohibit former NDP officials from running in the election. They based their position on the involvement of those officials during the 30-year reign of ousted Egyptian leader <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">news archive</a>] that, they claim, deprived Egyptian citizens of their free will. The court has not indicated when it will hand down its final verdict.  

<p>The November 28 election is considered the first free election following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak in February. Consequently, the upcoming elections have resulted in various legislative and court activities. This month, Egypt stated that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-to-amend-constitution-to-extend-voting-rights-to-citizens-abroad.php">amend its constitution</a> [JURIST report] based on a court ruling from a week before in order to allow citizens living abroad to vote in the parliamentary election. In addition, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] announced that it will create a law that will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-military-council-to-ratify-anti-corruption-law.php">ban</a> [JURIST report] anyone found guilty of corruption from the election process. Mubarak himself is faced with charges of complicity in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">deaths of more than 800 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive]. His trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] last month and will not resume until December 28. Also last month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a ban prohibiting formation of religious-based political parties. Some restrictions, however, still exist in the election process such as prohibition of using <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">religious slogans</a> [JURIST report] during campaigns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The blogger, Alaa Abdel Fattah, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-activist-group-condemns-military-imprisonment-of-blogger.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST report] by Egypt's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] at the end of October after refusing to answer prosecutors' questions because he thought that it was a conflict of interest to the military to investigate itself. The SCAF has accused Abdel Fatah for inciting violence during protests in October in which 27 people were killed and 300 people were injured. In their <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11593&LangID=E">briefing notes</a> [text] on the the issue, the OHCHR indicated that they had been closely following events in Egypt since the ousting of former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] and are concerned about what appears to be a diminishing public space for freedom of expression and association.  They went on to say:<blockquote>Civil society organisations and human rights activists, whose courage and non-violent protest brought about the change of regime in Egypt, must be guaranteed space for open debate, even if it means that the interim authorities are harshly criticised in public fora.</blockquote>The OHCHR "called for the release of Mr. Abdel-Fatah and all others who have been imprisoned for exercising their fundamental rights to free speech and association."

<p>In October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-group-warns-egypt-military-may-cover-up-protester-killings.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the SCAF may have attempted to cover up various aspects of the killing of more than two dozen mostly Coptic Christian demonstrators. In March, Arab and Egyptian human rights groups accused then-president Mubarak and police of murdering protesters during demonstrations, therein prompting the military council to instruct its top prosecutor to investigate the killings. Although the military council attempted to curb future demonstrations with a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-temporary-government-releases-decree-criminalizing-strikes.php">proposed law imposing prison sentences</a> [JURIST report] and fines for those inciting protests, the legislation was widely <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/25/egypt-revoke-ban-strikes-demonstrations">condemned</a> [press release] by international rights groups, namely HRW, as a violation of international law. In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] accused Egypt's military council of <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Relying on detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." HRW echoed this sentiment at the time in claiming that the Egyptian military was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">improperly detaining protesters and allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report]. Despite a warning to the Egyptian government from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [UN profile], in January to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">respect the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report], Egypt has endured criticism for the handling of its protests throughout the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Bill of Rights would replace the UK <a href="www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/documents/digitalasset/dg_070456.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> [text, PDF], but Commission leader <a href="http://www.scottishhumanrights.com/about/team/alanmiller">Alan Miller</a> [official profile] said the new legislation would weaken civil liberties rather than protect them. Instead, he argued, the UK should adopt more international human rights conventions into the already existing Human Rights Act:<blockquote>The status quo is not acceptable either. SHRC's recommendation is that all of the UK's international human rights obligations are incorporated into domestic law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which is overdue. These protections for the public are all the more necessary in the present times of austerity when budgetary decisions need to be made in ways which do not disproportionately impact upon the most vulnerable in our community.</blockquote>The UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/inquiries/uk-bill-of-rights-commission/">Bill of Rights Commission</a> was appointed by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official websites] and should conclude its work next year.

<p>In February, former UK Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf warned that a British Bill of Rights, as proposed by various members of the British government, would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-judge-warns-proposed-bill-of-rights-could-further-conflict-between-uk-echr.php">conflict</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which the UK has incorporated into its law. While the government has not stated an intention to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, Woolf has warned that continued adherence to the convention combined with the creation of a British Bill of Rights will create complications for judges in determining which to follow and further the existing conflict between the UK and the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Spaniard Antonio Vega Herrera will become a Brazilian citizen due to his marriage with his Brazilian partner, according to the country's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-concedes-permanent-residency-based-on-same-sex-marriage/2011/11/14/gIQAJHEQLN_story.html">Federal Register</a> [AP report]. The news comes a month after Brazil's <a href="http://www.stj.jus.br/portal_stj/publicacao/engine.wsp">High Court of Justice</a> [official website, in Portuguese] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/brazil-high-court-recognizes-same-sex-marriage.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the same-sex marriage of two women. The court voted 4-1 in favor of recognizing same-sex marriages. The ruling was necessary following a number of disparate rulings by lower courts on petitions from couples seeking to have their civil unions recognized as full marriages.

<p>Foreign and domestic courts and legislatures are increasingly addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions and marriages. In August, Chilean President <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidente/">Sebastian Pinera</a> [official profile, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/chile-president-introduces-civil-union-legislation.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex civil unions. The bill would extend inheritance and social welfare rights to same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual couples. Pinera insisted that marriage is between a man and a women but acknowledged that other forms of relationships are effective and that the state is obligated to recognize, protect and respect those partnerships. In April, Hungary added a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its constitution. France <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">upheld a same-sex marriage ban</a> [JURIST report] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gillard called on the <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/">Australian Labor Party</a> [party website] to back her adamant position that the institution of marriage has a particular meaning and should remain unchanged:<blockquote>Many will ask, what is my personal opinion and where do I stand in the debate? As I have said many times, I support maintaining the Marriage Act in its current form, and the government will not move legislation to change it. My position flows from my strong conviction that the institution of marriage has come to have a particular meaning and standing in our culture and nation and that should continue unchanged. The Labor Party platform currently reflects this view.</blockquote>Her opinion has come under attack by members of her own party as well as by parties on the liberal left, such as the <a href="http://greens.org.au/meet-us">Greens</a> [party website], who believe that legislatively recognizing consenting adults' right to choose, regardless of sexual identity, is the modern trend and essential for marriage equality. Currently only three Australian states recognize civil unions, though a poll shows that a majority of Australians favor same-sex marriage.  

<p>Australia historically has had a tumultuous past protecting the rights of same-sex couples but nevertheless denying the right to same-sex marriage. In May 2008, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dnp-australia-capital-abandons-plan-to.php">abandoned a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to legally recognize same-sex civil union ceremonies after the Australian federal government threatened to veto <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/b/db_27837/default.asp">Civil Partnerships Bill 2006</a> [legislative materials] if it passed the <a href="http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/">Legislative Assembly</a> [official websites]. Australian Capital Territory Attorney General Simon Corbell said that the self-governing territory will now move to legalize civil partnerships without ceremony so that same-sex couples can have access to Commonwealth pensions, tax and social security benefits. The Civil Partnerships Bill was introduced after an <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2006-22/default.asp">earlier civil unions law</a> [legislative materials] was actually <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-federal-government-nixes.php">overturned by the federal government</a> [JURIST report] because that law's attempt to equate civil unions with marriage was determined to be unacceptable.  In April of 2008, the Australian government introduced legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/australia-to-amend-laws-to-end-same-sex.php">amend over 100 federal laws</a> [press release] to remove discrimination against same-sex couples but continued to bar same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a>, former UK prime minister <a href="/currentawareness/blair.php">Tony Blair</a> [JURIST news archives] and other former US officials on charges in connection to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. The trial, set to begin Saturday, will be adjudicated by the Kuala Lumpur War Crime Tribunal (KLWCC), which consists of prominent legal minds including retired and non-retired Malaysian judges, lawyers, authors and professors. The KLWCC is charging Bush and Blair with crimes against peace for invading Iraq in violation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> [text] and international law. The KLWCC is also charging Bush and seven other former US officials, including former vice president Dick Cheney and former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, with the crime of torture and war crimes for their treatment of prisoners throughout the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The group alleges that the US leaders acted in violation of the UN Charter, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&sqi=2&ved=0CFQQFjAF&url=http%3A%2F%2Fprotection.unsudanig.org%2Fdata%2Flegal%2FThird%2520Geneva%2520Convention%2520(POW)%2C%25201949.pdf&ei=xobCToSGJ8fy0gHYg7TaDg&usg=AFQjCNGqDiJg0kWKyJIJwydR5x1uD8dGpw">Geneva Convention of 1949</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. The KLFCW stated:<blockquote>The Commission, having received complaints from war victims in Iraq in 2009, proceeded to conduct a painstaking and an in-depth investigation for close to two years and in 2011, constituted formal charges on war crimes against Bush, Blair and their associates.The Iraq invasion in 2003 and its occupation had resulted in the death of 1.4 million Iraqis. Countless others had endured torture and untold hardship. The cries of these victims have thus far gone unheeded by the international community.</blockquote>In the event of a conviction, the names of individuals found guilty will be entered into the Commission's Register of War Criminals and published globally.

<p>Various human rights groups have filed charges against US and UK officials alleging war crimes committed in Afghanistan and Iraq. In October, the attorney general for British Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-ag-blocks-bush-torture-suit.php">blocked a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by the <a href="http://www.ccij.ca/index-e.php">Canadian Centre for International Justice</a> [advocacy website] against Bush on torture allegations. Earlier in October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] urged the Canadian government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-urge-canada-to-arrest-ex-us-president-bush-ahead-of-visit.php">investigate and arrest</a> [JURIST report] Bush for his role in torture. In February, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.eu/">European Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy websites] urged the signatory states of the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Bush. Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">rejected consistently by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010, a former UN official <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-un-rights-expert-urges-afghanistan-war-crimes-investigation.php">strongly suggested</a> [JURIST report] a war crimes investigation of actions by both sides in the Afghanistan war. In 2009, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uk-high-court-criticizes-ministry-of.php/">UK High Court criticized</a> [JURIST report] its own Ministry of Defense for failure to investigate or release documents regarding a claim of war crimes against UK soldiers in Iraq. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The state of Louisiana on Monday filed <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Louisiana_v_Bryson.pdf">suit</a> [text, PDF] directly with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] arguing that undocumented immigrants should not be counted in the US census for the purpose of determining seats in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website]. The state alleges that it was put at a disadvantage when population totals were determined and that it lost a seat in the House because undocumented immigrants were improperly counted in census totals. The suit also alleges that "[b]ecause the population of non-immigrant foreign nationals is not distributed uniformly among the States, the inclusion of these individuals in apportionment figures alters the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives among the States" resulting in states with larger immigrant populations attaining greater electoral power, including greater strength in the Electoral College. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Art. I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">US Constitution</a> [text] states that seats in the House "shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State" and it provides that a census shall be taken every 10 years. Louisiana argues that under the Constitution, undocumented foreign nationals should not be counted in census figures. Rather, the state argues, only individuals with a permanent legal residence in a state should be counted for purposes of House seat apportionment. The Supreme Court must now decide whether to allow the suit to go forward.

<p>Immigration has been a hot-button issue across the US recently. A controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] has spurred numerous legal challenges as well as influencing similar legislation in states such as <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin that state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. That case has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court. In October, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-dismisses-arizona-counterclaim-over-immigration-law.php">dismissed a counterclaim</a> [JURIST report] filed by Brewer and state <a href="http://www.azag.gov/bio.html">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official profile] against the US government in the lawsuit challenging the Arizona immigration law. While the court ruled that Arizona had standing to bring the counterclaim, the court barred several counts in the claim because they had already been litigated before the court in a 1995 case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Then men are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/world/europe/france-somali-pirates/index.html">accused</a> [CNN report] of capturing the Carre-d'As IV in the Gulf of Aden and holding a French couple hostage for two weeks, allegedly demanded a ransom of USD $2 million. This marks France's first-ever piracy trial, with three additional trials expected to follow. The accused <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15740344">face life in prison</a> [BBC report] if convicted, and the trial could last until early December.

The court ruled 8 - 5 against government-imposed travel restrictions that started in August. Arroyo argued that she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment, unavailable in the Philippines, for a bone ailment, while government officials argued treatment is available in the Philippines and are concerned this is an attempt to flea the country. The opinion created three conditions that must be met in order for Arroyo to travel: a cash bond of two million pesos; appointment of a legal representative who will receive legal notices on behalf of Arroyo and her husband during their absence; and Arroyo is to notify the nearest Philippine consulate of their location at all times. Arroyo and her husband attempted to leave the country Tuesday after posting bond, but the government refused to allow them transit until they received an official copy of the order. A spokesperson for the government stated it plans to appeal the ruling. Oral arguments are set for November 22.

<p>Arroyo was president of the Philippines from 2001-2010. She left after the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] allegations and has denied any wrongdoing. Arroyo was elected to the <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] last year after the Philippine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">ruled her eligible to run</a> [JURIST report], despite protests that she had an unfair advantage. In July 2010, current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations. She was accused in 2007 of tampering with the congressional election results and illegally using governmental money in 2004 for her presidential campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, <a href = "http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/85718/">268 members of parliament passed</a> [Interfax report] a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/ukraine-parliament-delays-vote-that-would-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">presidential law "humanizing" economic crimes</a> [JURIST report], but eliminated provisions favoring Tymoshenko, while 147 voted to include amendments favorable to Tymoshenko. Last week, the <a href = "http://www.sta.gov.ua/control/en/index">State Tax Service of the Ukraine</a> [official website] announced <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/new-charges-formalized-against-tymoshenko.php">new formal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Tymoshenko for embezzlement and tax evasion. Current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival, maintains that the charges and convictions are <a href = "http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/85730/">not political</a> [Interfax report], and that were he to intercede in the process to absolve Tymoshenko, it would become politicized. Yanukovych also recognized that Tymoshenko's jailing has affected the Ukraine's relationship with the EU. Last month, the European Parliament <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">criticized the handling of Tymoshenko's case</a> [JURIST report], calling it a violation of human rights.

<p>Tymoshenko's prosecution has been <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">highly controversial</a> [JURIST comment] and has drawn harsh criticism internationally. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">EU has condemned</a> [JURIST report] her conviction as politically motivated and has indicated that it could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Yanukovych. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If the application is approved, Salauddin Quader Chowdhury <a href="http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=211214&cid=3">will be formally charged</a> [bdnews24.com report] with directly and indirectly contributing to every war crime covered by Bangladesh's <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973</a> (ICA) [text, PDF], including genocide, rape and abduction. The senior BNP leader is accused of more than two dozen incidents of human rights violations, including the shooting deaths of several people and the torture of others in the basement of his father's Chittagong residence during the war, purportedly in an effort to aid anti-liberation forces of West Pakistan against then-East Pakistan. The ICTB was established specifically to address charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 1971 conflict. Bangladesh's independence struggle against Pakistan lasted nine months.

<p>Last month, the ICTB for the first time <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-court-charges-senior-opposition-leader-with-war-crimes-from-1971-war.php">accepted charges against a suspect</a> [JURIST report]&#8212;another senior opposition leader. Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, head of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">Jamaat e Islami</a> (JI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is charged with similar war crimes, also allegedly stemming from the 1971 conflict. The ICTB has accepted 20 of 31 charges including allegations of aiding anti-liberation forces through murder, rape, torching villages, looting and forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. The ICTB originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-issues-arrest-warrants-for-islamist-leaders.php">issued four arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for such crimes in July 2010, and all four were filed against leaders of the JI. In May <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] sent a letter to the Bangladesh government praising its efforts through the ICTB to prosecute those responsible for atrocities committed during the war, but urging the government to ensure that the trials are carried out in <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-further-amendments-to-bangladesh-international-crimes-tribunal.php">accordance with international human rights expectations</a> [JURIST report].

The charges against Portillo in the US stem from accusations of his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/guatemalan-president-says-he-will-authorize-extradition-of-ex-leader-alfonso-portillo/2011/11/15/gIQAQxGaPN_story.html">involvement in money laundering and the embezzlement</a> [AP report] of $1.5 million in foreign donations from Taiwan, which were to be used to buy schoolbooks for Guatemalan children. Instead, it is alleged that Portillo deposited the funds in various banks for his personal use. Upon extradition, which may not take place for months, Portillo will stand trial in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. His <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/guatemala-court-approves-extradition-of.php">extradition was approved</a> [JURIST report] by a Guatemalan criminal court in March of 2010. Portillo, who was president from 2000 to 2004, was tried earlier this year in Guatemala on <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/guatemala-ex-president-begins-embezzlement-trial.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report]. In that trial, he was accused of diverting approximately USD $15 million in funds from the Ministry of Defense. However, he was found not guilty after the judges determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was personally involved.

<p>Colom has also faced recent legal trouble. In August, the Guatemalan <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled that former first lady Sandra Torres is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-high-court-bars-ex-first-lady-from-running-for-president.php">ineligible to run for the office of president</a> [JURIST report] because of her relationship to Colom, her ex-husband. Torres and Colom <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12813999">divorced earlier this year</a> [BBC report] after Torres announced her plans to represent the ruling National Unity for Hope party in elections that will be held in September. The Guatemalan <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/Guatemala%20Constitution.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF] bans relatives of the president from running for the office. Court President Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre held that because Torres was Colom's wife for most of the term, Torres would be in violation of the Constitution if she were to run for office. Otto Perez Molina, Torres' main opposition and leader of the Patriot Party, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12813999">accused the two of fraud</a> [BBC report] for divorcing in an effort to circumvent the constitutional ban. However, the court did not rule on whether this issue. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ filed its brief in response to a federal judge's <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66701706/Summary-Opinion-on-Alabama-Immigration-Law">September 28 ruling</a> [opinion text] that allowed the state to enforce a provision that makes it a felony for an illegal alien to conduct business with the state, among other provisions. The DOJ argued in its brief that the Alabama immigration laws are preempted by federal laws regulating immigration in the US because of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in the US Constitution. The DOJ stated:<blockquote>[D]eterminations about the conditions under which aliens may live in the United States, including unlawfully present aliens, based specifically on their status as such, are reserved for the National Government. It is the National Government that is responsive to the competing goals of immigration policy on behalf of all the States and to the foreign policy concerns that must inform determinations about how foreign nationals in our Nation should be treated. ... H.B. 56 acts as a state immigration policy and not as a mechanism to regulate areas of legitimate state interest.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a separate <a href="/paperchase/11.14.11-%20Opening%20Brief.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] also asking the court to overturn the new law. The ACLU's brief argued that the laws are designed to make life in Alabama so difficult for illegal aliens that they will be <a href="/forum/2011/11/kevin-johnson-alabama-immigration.php">forced to leave the state</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Like the DOJ, the ACLU also argued that Alabama's law is a direct attempt to regulate immigration, which is an area that the states have no legitimate interest in regulating and is left only to the federal government to legislate.

<p>In October, the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] portions of the law after the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for Northern Alabama</a> [official website] twice refused to do so. Religious groups and representatives of several rights groups including the ACLU, the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center </a>(NILC), the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] have stated that the Alabama law is the most extreme of the recent state anti-immigration laws influenced by controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Arizona+SB+1070">Arizona SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive]. Since the legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> in June, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">16 countries filed briefs</a> [JURIST reports] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was charged with incitement and theft of a military weapon in connection with a demonstration at Maspero last month, which resulted in 27 deaths and more than 300 civilian injuries. The prosecutors on Sunday extended detention of Abd El Fattah for another 15 days. HRW urged the prosecutors to release him because of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/15/egypt-free-blogger-held-maspero-case">lack of evidence</a> [HRW report] supporting the charges and the excessive force used by the military against civilians during the demonstration.<blockquote>The military government has no business prosecuting Abdel Fattah, or any other civilian, in a military court, much less in a case involving the military's own unlawful violence against protesters. These charges presented without evidence against one of the country's best known activists are further reflection of the military's desire to silence its critics.</blockquote>In addition to the call for Abd El Fattah's release, HRW criticized the military's concealment as to whether military officers are also being investigated related to the Maspero case and its rejection of any responsibility for the death of civilians during the demonstration despite of witness testimonies and a <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=500:2011-11-02-19-51-28&catid=43:2010-03-09-13-00-53&Itemid=55">report</a> [text, in Arabic] by the <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/en/">National Council for Human Rights</a> (NCHR) [advocacy website] alleging to the contrary.

<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] last week <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-office-voices-concern-over-egypt-military-trial-for-blogger.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] in its <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11593&LangID=E">briefing notes</a> [text] concerns of Egypt's limitation for freedom of expression and association calling for release of Abd El Fattah who merely exercised his fundamental right to free speech. Earlier this month, the Egyptian activist group <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/category/organisation/no-military-trials-for-civilians">No Military Trials for for Civilians</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="http://en.nomiltrials.com/2011/10/statement-of-solidarity-with-alaa-abdel.html">condemned</a> [statement, text] Abd El Fattah's arrest and imprisonment. The blogger and activist was initially <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-activist-group-condemns-military-imprisonment-of-blogger.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST report] for the <a href="http://bikyamasr.com/46924/human-rights-groups-condemn-military-trials-for-civillians/">charges</a> [Bikay Masr report] last month. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The order was issued in response to Mladic's absence last week from court due to illness. The court also noted that while the issue of Mladic's health had been raised on several past occasions in court and various filings, neither the prosecutor nor Mladic's defense team had requested a medical examination. The report is expected to be thorough in its review:<blockquote>The Chamber ordered that the medical expert provide an assessment of Mladic's overall current health condition as well as an evaluation of his medical history, including the background to and current status of any health condition predating Mladic's arrival at the Detention Unit. The medical expert is to assess whether and to what extent his current overall health condition is related to his medical history.</blockquote>Mladic has consented to the release of the medical information. However, the court warned that it is important not to interpret the results in any particular way as the public would not be served by positive or negative speculation.

<p>In October, the ICTY prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">refused to seek further appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the tribunal's refusal to split Mladic's trial into separate actions: one for his conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. At his <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">second appearance</a> [JURIST report] he refused to enter a plea. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports].

The ACLU opined that a district judge's April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a lawsuit by six same-sex couples in <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/donaldson-and-guggenheim-v-montana">Donaldson and Guggenheim v. State of Montana</a> [ACLU backgrounder] was a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-asks-montana-supreme-court-grant-legal-protection-same-sex-couples">breach of separation of powers</a> [press release], saying that courts have a duty to interpret whether or not actions by the legislature or the executive branch are unconstitutional. The same-sex couples in this case are not seeking the right to wed, but rather that they want to be able to make decisions like married couples about their families' health care, finances, inheritance and burials. In its brief, the ACLU argued, "[t]he State's exclusion of same-sex couples from state statutory benefits and obligations solely due to the fact that they are in committed, intimate same-sex relationships infringes Plaintiffs' constitutional rights of privacy, dignity, and the pursuit of safety, health and happiness." Montana <a href="http://www.doj.mt.gov/department/attorneygeneralbiography.asp">Attorney General Steve Bullock</a> [official profile] is expected to file a response by December 14.

<p>Many states continue to debate issues pertaining to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same+sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archives]. Last week, a New Jersey court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a marriage equality lawsuit, which seeks to overturn New Jersey's civil unions law on equal protection grounds, could proceed.

The <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/equatorial-guinea-holds-referendum-on-constitutional-changes.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report], which was approved with near-unanimous support, removed the age limit for presidents and created a vice president position, apparently allowing current President Teodoro Obiang Nguema to name his son as his successor. HRW and EG Justice released a declaration following the referendum <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/11/equatorial-guinea-move-consolidate-power">condemning it as a political tool</a> [joint statement] that would strengthen Obiang's power and prevent democracy. EG Justice has raised issues with the way the election was conducted. They claim that voters were subjected to intimidation tactics and allowed to cast votes for family members who were not present. The sources came from opposition party members observing the voting and voters who described conditions at polling places. EG Justice found that in some polling locations there were no ballot cards for a  "no," only ballots with "yes." The African director of HRW claimed that, the government "failed to provide an inclusive, transparent, and accountable voting process [and] the result of the referendum and the government's commitment to true democratic reforms both lack credibility." The government has refused to comment. 

<p>This is not the first issue human rights groups have had concerns over democracy in Equatorial Guinea. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/execution-four-men-equatorial-guinea-condemned-2010-08-23">condemned</a> [press release] the government for the execution of four men <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/equatorial-guinea-defends-executions-over-2009-coup-plot.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of an attempted assassination on Obiang in 2009. AI received reports that claimed the men were tortured while in prison and forced to confess to the crimes. One of the convicted men requested to see his family, but by the time they arrived at the prison he had already been executed. Obiang <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/equatorial-guinea-president-says-coup-plotters-had-fair-trial.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the decision, stating that no laws were broken and all necessary legal procedures were followed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill passed the House by a vote of 115-37 and the Senate by a vote of 95-56 and was sent to be signed by <a href="http://www.mass.gov/governor/">Governor Deval Patrick</a> [official website]. The bill includes gender identity under the state's non-discrimination statutes, except public accommodations, and amends existing laws to protect people targeted for violence and harassment. The bill adds the following definition to the General Laws of Massachusetts:<blockquote>"Gender identity" shall mean a person's gender-related identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth. Gender-related identity may be shown by providing evidence including, but not limited to, medical history, care or treatment of the gender-related identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender-related identity or any other evidence that the gender-related identity is sincerely held, as part of a person's core identity; provided however, gender-related identity shall not be asserted for improper purpose.</blockquote>Opponents claim the bill is an invitation to lawsuits and a threat to small business, and the legislature should be focusing on the economy and job creation. Proponents deem the passage necessary to ensure the rights of transgender people and reduce the significant threats they face. Upon governor signature, Massachusetts will become the sixteenth state to pass similar legislation protecting the class of transgender people.

<p>Protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a diverse political issue. In June of this year, Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-passes-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.php">passed similar legislation</a> [JURIST report] defining "gender identity or expression" and providing protection in the state's existing anti-discrimination laws. Other national action includes measures to stop hate crimes against LGBT individuals. In March, US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Representative Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] introduced legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">protect LGBT students from bullying</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that contained a measure extending the definition of federal hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Internationally, homosexuality remains a criminal offense in more than 70 countries around the world, and statistics show that anti-LGBT crimes are on the rise <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hate-crimes-against-lgbt-people-rise-worldwide-un-rights-chief.php">worldwide</a> and in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/anti-lgbt-violence-on-the-rise-in-us-report.php">US</a> [JURIST reports]. These crimes, in addition to the absence of state protection against employment discrimination, have been estimated to <a href="/dateline/2011/05/edward-sanfilippo-transgender-discrimination.php">cost US states millions of dollars annually</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The provision, which was <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/press/SASC%20RCV%20ON%20FY%202012%20NDAA-SECOND%20MARKUP.pdf">approved by a 26-0 vote</a> [roll call, PDF], allows the military to have complete custody and control over terror suspects and grants authority to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] over whether suspects should be tried in military or civilian courts. Disagreements regarding the provision have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked its passage for months</a> [CNN report], but were finally resolved by top Democrat and Committee Chairman <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/">Senator Carl Levin</a> and ranking Republican <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/">Senator John McCain</a> [official websites]. The provision was passed <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/15/senators-strike-deal-detainee-interrogations/">despite the protests of the White House</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report], which refused to sign off on the agreement because of the belief that the FBI should have unrestricted access and interrogation rights over domestically detained al Qaeda suspects, rather than the military.  

<p>The Armed Services Committee's decision, which still must survive the Senate floor and the veto power of President Barack Obama, comes on the heels of an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling, and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. The report posits that these policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to close the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news report], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ieng, the former minister of social affairs and the only female leader to be charged, had been charged with genocide but will be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jgznAK2G5jnBZHFScfBSjHsukUdQ?docId=CNG.a6c4fe535e83c04c99bb1977de6e8e03.401">released as soon as possible</a> [AFP report] because of her recent diagnosis of dementia caused by the 79-year-old's Alzheimer's disease. The judges found, based on the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-concludes-fitness-hearing-for-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">opinions of a geriatrician and four psychiatrists</a> [JURIST report], that Ieng's incapacity to remember her own husband's name, let alone her alleged contribution to the death of up to two million people, would not serve the interests of justice:<blockquote>While acknowledging the possibility that Ieng Thirith could attempt to feign the cognitive impairment in view of the consequences of a finding of incapacity, all experts considered it unlikely that Ieng Thirith could falsely present with dementia. ... [Ieng's] long-term and short-term memory are limited and ... her condition will continue to deteriorate over time. ... The Psychiatric Experts ... considered that she possessed some understanding that she was accused and of what she was accused ... [and] retained some capacity to enter a plea, to understand the charges and details of the evidence against her, and to testify. ... However, the Accused's impaired memory will likely impact upon her ability to recall events that occurred between 1975 and 1979. ... [Ieng's inability to] adequately instruct counsel and effectively participate in her own defense ... [restricts the] exercise these fundamental fair trial rights meaningfully, and in accordance with the international standards ... the Chamber has no alternative but to declare her unfit.</blockquote>Prosecutors have 24 hours to appeal this decision. All four leaders have pleaded not guilty to charges including crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture.

<p>The trial of the other three surviving leaders is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-begin-khmer-rouge-trial-in-november.php">set to begin</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, November 21. The prosecution will have two days for opening statements followed by half a day of opening statements for the defense. The first segment of the trial is expected to conclude by December 16 for Christmas recess and will resume after the holiday break on January 9. In September, the ECCC ordered the trials be <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">split into a series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report]. The ECCC said that the separation of trials will allow the tribunal to <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/articles/severance-proceedings-ordered-case-002">deliberate more quickly</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">case</a> [materials] against the elderly defendants. The first trial will focus on the beginning two phases of population movement and allegations of crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution not on religious grounds and forced disappearances associated with the first phases of population movement. Subsequent trials will focus on the third phase of population movement, genocide, persecution based on religious grounds and violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Conventions of 1949</a> [ICRC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Seeking to enforce an earlier subpoena for access to reparations claims filed by coastal residents, <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] filed the lawsuit in Hinds County Chancery Court in July, claiming to be "conducting an investigation into whether [GCCF's] procedures for processing claims constitute fair and/or deceptive trade practices in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act (MCPA)." The fund's administrator, Washington lawyer <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Kenneth_R._Feinberg">Kenneth Feinberg</a> [WP profile], had the case removed to federal court, claiming that original jurisdiction lay with that court by virtue of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_43_10_29_20_III.html">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a> (OCSLA) [Cornell LII materials]. District Judge Carlton Reeves concluded that, firstly, Hood's petition does not amount to a "civil action" as the term is used in the federal removal statute, and therefore GCCF was not entitled to remove the case to federal court, and, secondly, that the operation of "developing and publishing standards for recoverable claims" from the Deepwater Horizon spill did not constitute an "operation conducted <em>on</em> the outer Continental Shelf" as required by OCSLA and so OCSLA cannot apply as a proper basis for federal jurisdiction. Reeves addressed only the issue of jurisdiction, and the original question of whether the subpoena at the core of Hood's petition is lawful under the MCPA is "another question altogether" to be decided in state court.

<p>Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP, as evidence of the oil giant's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come to light. In July the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-dismisses-bp-oil-spill-fraud-lawsuit.php">dismissed consolidated racketeering claims against BP</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the spill brought under the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [text] act. In February, Hood asked the district court to order the GCCF to fulfill its legal obligations to aid victims of the spill and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-ag-seeks-to-remedy-deficiencies-of-bp-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">remedy inadequate claims mechanisms</a> [JURIST report]. The GCCF <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August 2010 following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. Former Alabama Attorney General Troy King <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August of last year against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July 2010 a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. One month prior, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the DOJ would review whether any criminal or civil <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ICTR continues to try suspects for crimes occurring during the 1994 Rwandan conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in which approximately 800,000 people were killed.

Bizimungu was sentenced to 30 years in prison while two others, Francois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu, to 20 years in prison and Augustin Ndindiliyimana to time served since his arrest in 2000. Last December, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ictr-convicts-former-military-officer-of-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan Armed Forces lieutenant Ildephonse Hategekimana to life imprisonment after convicting him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.

In Somalia, Somalis and Kenyans are engaged in battle to push out the al-Shabaab rebels after they invaded South Somalia in mid-October. Amos said that the conflict would lead to internal displacement as civilians begin planting their crops. Sudan is waging a civil war of its own, in its battle with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14069082">South Sudan</a> [BBC backgrounder], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">gained independence</a> [JURIST report] in early July. Amos highlighted the need to protect the millions of people who cross the border between the two countries, as they muddle through post-secession issues. For the last 10 months the Yemeni people have been trying to oust <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php?lng=en">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website]. The deadly clashes between rebels and governmental forces have left many dead and cut off civilian access to necessary public services, including health care, according to Amos. She also mentioned the excessive use of force by Syrian authorities to quell the popular uprising, which has left <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-right-office-syria-death-toll-exceeds-3500.php">more than 3,500 people dead</a> [JURIST report], as an example of the violation of international law. Amos cited the escalation of violence as detrimental to the work of humanitarian organizations. Such organizations cannot place their people in potentially harmful situations, and the lack of personnel has led to a lack of humanitarian aid. 

<p>The UN is not the only human rights group to advocate for better conditions for civilians in conflict. In July, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR52/001/2011/en/2b90b425-0742-4c83-87f0-e8fd0b6baa51/afr520012011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] highlighting the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-affecting-somalia-children-ai.php">deterioration of human rights conditions</a> [JURIST report] in armed conflict zones, especially for children. The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] has called for Yemen to put an <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-security-council-urges-end-to-yemen-violence.php">end to violence</a> [JURIST report] against peaceful protesters and urged the country to comply with international law in regards to civilians. In August, Amnesty International and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] both claimed to have evidence that the Sudanese army committed <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/sudan-accused-of-war-crimes-in-south-kordofan-region.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report] in the South Kordofan region of the country. In July the UN Security Council called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-calls-for-end-to-fighting-in-disputed-sudan-kordofan-region.php">end to the fighting</a> [JURIST report] in the region. Amos denounced the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/421571">human rights abuses</a> [statement] in the region in June. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A five-judge appeals panel reordered the fine imposed on Hartmann, a French national, and then <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40414&Cr=&Cr1=">converted the fine into a seven-day prison sentence</a> [UN News Centre report]. The court then "directed and authorized" France to search for, arrest and detain Hartmann and surrender her to the tribunal, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands. Hartmann's conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-dismisses-icty-staff-members-appeal-of-contempt-conviction.php">upheld on appeal</a> [JURIST report] in July of this year, after which the court ordered her to pay her fine in two installments of &#8364;3,500 each by mid-August and mid-September, respectively. Hartmann subsequently wrote to the tribunal saying she is indigent and unable to pay her fine. She claimed that her supporters had deposited the funds to pay the fine in a French bank account, but the tribunal's finance department stated it had yet to receive either installment and, deeming the fine to have not been paid, the appeals chamber decided to convert the fine into a prison term. Hartmann formerly served as the official spokesperson for chief ICTY prosecutor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla del Ponte</a> [BBC profile].

<p>In 2009 a specially appointed chamber <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/icty-ex-spokesperson-found-guilty-of.php">convicted Hartmann of two counts of contempt</a> JURIST report] for allegedly disclosing protected information of appellate chamber decisions from the trial of former Serbian president <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] in a book and an article she wrote in 2007 and 2008. The original <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icty-ex-spokeswoman-contempt-trial.php">trial began</a> in June 2009, Hartmann having been <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icty-indicts-former-spokesperson-for.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST reports] the previous August. At an initial appearance, Hartmann did <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/former-icty-spokesperson-defers-plea-on.php">not enter a plea</a> [JURIST report] and a plea of not guilty was entered on her behalf. Before being indicted, Hartmann drew media attention by <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/western-nations-blocked-karadzic-arrest.php">repeating allegations</a> [JURIST report] that former US president Bill Clinton and former French president Jacques Chirac had <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-and-allies-impeded-efforts-to.php">planned a campaign</a> [JURIST report] to capture <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>] but later backed down following a change in policy. Hartmann has also said that Russia aided in moving Karadzic to safety in Belarus, and alleged that the West helped in order to hide information about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Brown</em> <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/13401.htm">materials</a>] Thursday that sponsors of <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>] and other ballot initiatives can defend them in court when the state refuses to do so. When the same-sex marriage ban was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down last year</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Project Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">sought guidance</a> [JURIST report] from the California Supreme Court on whether the defendants have standing to defend the proposition when the state itself refused to do so. The California Supreme Court answered in the affirmative:<blockquote>The judicial system is designed to operate through public proceedings in which adversaries litigate factual and legal issues thoroughly and vigorously. When an initiative measure is challenged in court, the integrity and effectiveness of the judicial process require that a competent and spirited defense be presented. If public officials refuse to provide that defense, the ability of the initiative proponents to intervene in the pending litigation, and to appeal an adverse judgment, is inherent in, and essential to the effective exercise of, the constitutional initiative power. To hold otherwise not only would undermine that constitutional power, it also would allow state executive branch officials to effectively annul voter-approved initiatives simply by declining to defend them, thereby permitting those officials to exceed their proper role in our state government&#8216;s constitutional structure.</blockquote>Although seemingly a setback for same-sex marriage supporters since the ruling gives same-sex marriage opponents the opportunity to argue against the district court's ruling that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional, the <a href="http://www.afer.org/">American Foundation for Equal Rights</a> [advocacy website] stated that it was actually a victory because they are confident that the <a href="http://www.afer.org/news/california-court-rules-prop-8-case-advances/">Ninth Circuit will uphold</a> [press release] the district court's ruling and a victory in the largest appeals court in the country will set a huge precedent.

<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] in June rejected a motion by Proposition 8 supporters to vacate Judge Vaughn Walker's holding that the same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional. In March, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_vid=0000006121">heard oral arguments</a> [video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000472">Perry v. Brown</a> [case materials] at the end of 2010. The hearing was divided into two one-hour sessions, with the first section focusing on the issue of standing, and the second focusing on Proposition 8's constitutionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The White House expressed serious concerns about provisions in the bill governing detainees, which would allow the military to have complete custody and control over terror suspects and grant authority to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] over whether suspects should be tried in military or civilian courts. The provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">approved on Wednesday</a> [JURIST report] by the SASC in an unanimous vote after disagreements regarding the provisions had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked their passage for months</a> [CNN report]. In the statement the White House noted that the Obama administration has "serious legal and policy concerns" about the proposed changes to detainee policies, stating that the provisions would "disrupt the Executive branch's ability to enforce the law and impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on the U.S. Government's ability to aggressively combat international terrorism." The White House also warned that a section of the bill that would apply military custody requirements to certain individuals in the US "would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets." According to the Obama administration, the detainee provisions of the bill would "rebuild the walls" between intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals making it more difficult to prevent terrorist attacks. The White House also noted the administration's willingness to work with Congress to address the concerns expressed in the statement. 

<p>The Armed Services Committee's decision, which still must survive a vote in the full Senate comes on the heels of an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling, and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. The report posits that these policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to close the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news report], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arroyo was <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Philippines-arrests-ex-president-in-hospital-room-2275314.php">arrested in her hospital room</a> [AP report] where she was being treated for a bone ailment. She was previously unable to seek medical care outside of the Philippines because of travel restrictions in connection with her charges. However, earlier this week the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Philippine Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a temporary restraining <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/resolutions/2011/november2011/199034_199046_TRO.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] allowing her to leave the country despite the accusations. The court ruled 8-5 against government-imposed travel restrictions that started in August. Arroyo argued that she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment, unavailable in the Philippines while government officials argued treatment is available in the Philippines and are concerned this is an attempt to flee the country. After that decision was upheld Friday, the government issued the warrant for her arrest which overrode the court's decision allowing her to travel. Arroyo continues to <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Philippines-arrests-ex-president-in-hospital-room-2275314.php">deny wrongdoing</a> [AP report] and alleges that the charges reflect political persecution by the government. 

<p>On Tuesday, Arroyo and her husband attempted to leave the country after posting bond, but the government refused to allow them transit until they received an official copy of the court order. A spokesperson for the government stated it would appeal the ruling. Oral arguments were set for November 22. Arroyo was president of the Philippines from 2001-2010. She left office after the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] brought allegations of corruption. Arroyo was elected to the House of Representatives last year after the Philippine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">ruled her eligible to run</a> [JURIST report], despite protests that she had an unfair advantage. In July 2010, current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontrussia2.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Russian lawmakers in the city of St. Petersburg on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved an initial reading of a bill that would impose fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The legislation, which was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iN30TwwunCPBtqr3Pnt0fxHgrRaQ?docId=CNG.4a103f4c12c31f010418ccb1595560e0.371">supported by the ruling United Russia party</a> [AFP report], would ban gay pride parades, and any activity in public which could influence children and that could be viewed as promoting a gay, lesbian, transgender or LGBT lifestyle. Individuals convicted under the law would be <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/st-pete-may-fine-gays-who-are-open/447995.html">subject to fines between 3,000 and 5,000 rubles</a> ($100-$160 USD) [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], while organizations could be fined up to 50,000 rubles for "promoting" homosexuality. Sponsors of the bill claim it is necessary because <a href="http://en.ria.ru/analysis/20111118/168818571.html">homosexual propaganda "threatens" Russia</a> [RIA Novosti report] and that "sexual deviation" negatively impacts Russian children. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of the <a href="http://council.gov.ru/index.html">Russian Parliament</a> [official website, in Russian] and former governor of St. Petersburg, noted his support for the measure and indicated that a similar national ban should be considered. Russian gay rights supporters condemned the bill as an attempt to politicize the issue and bolster political support for the United Russia party in St. Petersburg among the uneducated population. They condemned the bill as being unprofessional, due to the presence of numerous spelling errors, and excessively regressive. According to legal scholars, the <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/constit.html">Russian Constitution</a> [text] may allow limitations to be placed on the rights of homosexuals due to the constitutional ability to balance the interests of society and limit rights of a social group if they infringe upon the rights of another social group. Before it can be enacted, the legislation must survive two more readings, although approval of the bill is ultimately expected. 

<p>Russia has long struggled with the acceptance of homosexuality. In 2008, several Russian gay rights activists were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/moscow-gay-pride-advocates-arrested-for.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by police in Moscow for holding events commemorating the 1993 law that put an end to government prosecution for homosexual activity in Russia. It was the third consecutive year Moscow Pride held events around the city to elude officials attempting to <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/moscow-court-bans-gay-pride-parade.php">enforce a local ban on gay pride parades</a> [JURIST report] that was put in place due to fears of violence. The UN has attempted to pass resolutions aimed at ending sexuality discrimination worldwide, but has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues, due to no international consensus on the morality of homosexuality. In June, <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed the <a href = "http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], which is the first resolution to call for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">end to sexuality discrimination worldwide</a> [JURIST report] and to recognize it as a "priority" for the UN. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. Two years ago, the UN passed a <A href = "http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/491-1.pdf">gay rights declaration</a> [text, PDF], which the <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">US signed and sponsored</a> [JURIST report]. The declaration, a nonbinding measure that does not have the full force of a resolution, called on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href = "http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. The year before, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, the Washington secretary of state began to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-releases-names-on-washington-domestic-partnership-petition.php">release the names</a> [JURIST report] after a federal judge lifted an injunction against their release. The <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2016570433_signatures22m.html">release was halted</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] days later when an emergency motion was filed by a group concerned about backlash against signers of the petitions. On Wednesday, the appeals court decided the appeal was "moot due to the (previous) release of R-71 petitions and district court's order identifying the Doe plaintiffs" and that there is question of whether the plaintiff-appellants have "standing to bring this appeal on behalf of R-71 petition signers." <a href="http://protectmarriagewa.com/">Protect Marriage Washington</a> [advocacy website], the group bringing the suit, has filed a notice of appeal with the court.

<p>In 2009 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-blocks-release-of-names.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> against release of the names, but in 2010 it <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-release-of-names-on-petition-does-not-violate-free-speech.php">decided</a> [JURIST reports] release of the names was not a violation of the First Amendment. <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Washington_Domestic_Partners_Rights_and_Responsibilities,_Referendum_71_%282009%29">Referendum 71</a> [summary] was passed in 2009 by Washington voters, affirming approval of <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2009&bill=5688">Senate Bill 5688</a> [text], to give domestic partnerships the same legal rights as married couples. It was put on the ballot by Protect Marriage Washington in a failed attempt to vote down Senate Bill 5688. Many opposing groups <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/page.aspx?id=25538">filed for release</a> [AG website] of the names on the petitions, causing Protect Marriage Washington to file the ensuing lawsuits to protect signers' identities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/HIGH%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">High Court</a> [official website] ruling, two out of three judges found that the comments made to a newspaper by former officer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15791087">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile] had breached Sri Lanka's emergency laws that were put in place during the war. According to prosecutors, Fonseka told the <a href="http://www.thesundayleader.lk/"><em>Sunday Leader</em></a> [media website] newspaper on December 13, 2009, that he was informed that secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaska, the brother of Sri Lankan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3602101.stm">President Mahinda Rajapaska</a> [BBC profile], ordered not to accommodate surrendering soldiers.

<p>By the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009, Fonseka had successfully led the Sri Lankan army to victory over the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels, and both he and Mahinda Rajapaksa became popular in the country's political scene. However, shortly after his political defeat in the January 2010 presidential election, Fonseka was arrested and found guilty in August 2010 for <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/former-sri-lanka-army-chief-fonseka-convicted-of-engaging-in-politics-while-on-duty.php">engaging in politics while still on active duty</a> [JURIST report].

The prosecutors argue that the decision to release Ieng should be delayed for six months and she should be held in detention during that time and undergo medical treatment for her condition. The prosecutors also argue that the court had no legal basis for its decision to immediately release Ieng and that international jurisprudence dictates that when international criminal proceedings are adjourned due to unfitness of the defendant to stand trial, the norm is for that individual to remain in custody or be released subject to restrictive conditions when there is a even a remote possibility that the individual could regain their mental faculties. The prosecutors point out that the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] did not terminate proceedings against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/talic/cis/en/cis_talic_en.pdf">Talic</a> [ICTY case information, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/talic/4">materials</a>] or <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djukic/cis/en/cis_djukic_en.pdf">Djukic</a> [ICTY case information, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/djukic/4">materials</a>] until their deaths even though they were afflicted with incurable terminal illnesses. The prosecutors further argue that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F1E0AC1C-A3F3-4A3C-B9A7-B3E8B115E886/140164/Rules_of_procedure_and_Evidence_English.pdf">International Criminal Court Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text, PDF] mandate that judgments that an individual is unfit to stand trial be reviewed within 120 days unless there are "reasons to do otherwise" and there is no precedent for the individual to be released during this period.

<p>The trial of the other three surviving leaders is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-begin-khmer-rouge-trial-in-november.php">set to begin</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, November 21. The prosecution will have two days for opening statements followed by half a day of opening statements for the defense. The first segment of the trial is expected to conclude by December 16 for Christmas recess and will resume after the holiday break on January 9. In September, the ECCC ordered the trials be <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">split into a series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report].

De Schutter stressed that WTO policies do not adequately ensure the right to food in developing countries, especially as international food prices are on the rise. He expressed concern that existing WTO trade regulations leave developing countries vulnerable drastic price increases which can lead to food shortages. The rapporteur recommended that the WTO review and make appropriate changes to its polices to allow developing countries greater food security:<blockquote>WTO members should redefine how food security is treated in multilateral trade agreements so that policies to achieve food security and the realization of the human right to adequate food are no longer treated as a derivations from but as recognized principal objectives of agricultural trade policy. Food security is presently treated under the WTO as the grounds for exceptions for a very limited range of trade liberalization commitments...Members should preserve and create a range of flexibilities in the Doha Round Negotiations in order to ensure that the future international trade regime operates in lock step with multilateral and national efforts to address food insecurity.</blockquote>De Schutter's comments are in anticipation of the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min11_e/min11_e.htm">Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference</a> [materials] to be held December 15&#8211;17 in Geneva, Switzerland. As of earlier this month, the <a href="http://docsonline.wto.org/imrd/directdoc.asp?DDFDocuments/t/wt/min11/W1.doc">provisional agenda</a> [document] for the conference does not list specific topics of discussion. 

<p>Last month, De Schutter voiced his support for a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-supports-mexico-right-to-food-constitutional-reform.php">reformation of the Mexican constitution</a> [JURIST report] which will recognize the right to food. In 2010, De Schutter urged governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-expert-urges-legal-reforms-to-fight-global-hunger-crisis.php">institute legal reform to help fight hunger</a> [JURIST report] and promote the right to food. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] in 2007 called for an increased effort to uphold the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/un-sg-urges-renewed-focus-on.php">"fundamental human right" to food</a> [JURIST report] for people around the world who suffer from chronic hunger. The right to adequate food is recognized in Articles 24(2)(c) and 27(3) of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, Article 12(2) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a>, and Articles 25(f) and 28(1) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [texts]. Article 25 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a> [text], adopted by the UN in 1948, states that "[e]veryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food."</p>]]></content:encoded>

A fugitive since his father's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">regime fell last month</a> [JURIST report], the highest-profile son of deceased former dictator <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/19/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-captured">arrested without a fight</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the desert near the southern city of Sabha. Saif al-Islam was captured overnight with several armed companions, reportedly in an attempt to escape to neighboring Niger. Libyan state television has reported that Saif al-Islam arrived uninjured at an army base in the town of Zintan, 90 miles southwest of Tripoli, after being captured by Zintan fighters, part of one of the powerful Libyan militias that are friendly to the country's <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [website]. Saif al-Islam is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">wanted</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf">crimes against humanity</a> [warrant, PDF], but many in Libya want him tried locally, and the NTC previously insisted it will try any war criminals in Libya and not extradite them to The Hague. The militia fighters have stated that it is up to the NTC to decide where Saif al-Islam will be tried, but that until the new Libyan government is formed they will hold Saif al-Islam at Zintan, a base for militia forces in the Nafusa Mountains, which played a key part in the storming of Tripoli in the summer. Interim prime minister Abdel-Rahim al-Keeb is due to announce the new government this week.

<p>ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said Saturday that he <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7MJ0CQ20111119">will go to Libya in the next week</a> [Reuters report] to discuss Saif al-Islam's fate. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/show_personnel.php?office=2">Ottilia Maunganidze</a> [profile], a researcher at the <a href="http://www.iss.co.za/default.php">Institute for Security Studies</a> [website], wrote that the <a href="/hotline/2011/11/ottilia-maunganidze-gaddafi-investigation.php">NTC must meet its international obligations</a> [JURIST op-ed] and ensure justice for human rights violations by surrendering Saif al-Islam to the ICC. <a href="http://tupazlaw.com/profile.htm">Edsel Tupaz</a> of Tupaz &#38; Associates and <a href="http://www.countryrisksolutions.com/bio.html">Daniel Wagner</a> [profiles] of Country Risk Solutions wrote this month that while Libya needs a "strategically targeted court system" with a <a href="/sidebar/2011/11/tupaz-wagner-libya-transition.php">specialized war crimes court</a> [JURIST op-ed] at its core, currently there is no avoiding "the fact that there are no domestic judicial mechanisms [in Libya] ... to enforce the voice of the ICC." Ocampo last month stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-has-evidence-against-gaddafi-son-for-planning-civilian-attacks.php">has evidence against Saif al-Islam</a> [JURIST report] for his role in planning attacks on Libyan civilians. According to Ocampo there is "substantial evidence" that Saif al-Islam hired mercenaries to assist him in carrying out plans to attack demonstrators that protested the rule of his father. Libyan rebel leaders <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">allegedly captured Saif al-Islam</a> [JURIST report] in August, but he was free by September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Philippine <a href="http://www.comelec.gov.ph/">Commission on Elections</a> [official website] approved fraud charges against Arroyo Friday and she was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-arrested-on-fraud-corruption-charges.php">arrested in her hospital room</a> [JURIST report], in which she was being treated for a bone ailment and remains under police guard. Arroyo was previously unable to seek medical care outside of the Philippines because of travel restrictions in connection with her charges, but earlier this week the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Philippine Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">issued a temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] allowing her to leave the country despite the accusations. The court ruled 8-5 against the government-imposed travel restrictions that started in August. Arroyo argued that she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment unavailable in the Philippines, while government officials argued that local treatment is available and her travel is really an attempt to flee the country. After the decision was upheld Friday, the government issued the warrant for her arrest which overrode the court's decision allowing her to travel. Arroyo continues to <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Philippines-arrests-ex-president-in-hospital-room-2275314.php">deny wrongdoing</a> [AP report] and alleges that the charges reflect political persecution by the government.

<p>On Tuesday Arroyo and her husband attempted to leave the country after posting bond, but the government refused to allow them transit until they received an official copy of the court order. A spokesperson for the government stated it would appeal the ruling. Oral arguments were set for November 22. Arroyo was president of the Philippines from 2001-2010. She left office after the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] brought allegations of corruption. Arroyo was elected to the House of Representatives last year after the Philippine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">ruled her eligible to run</a> [JURIST report], despite protests that she had an unfair advantage. In July 2010, current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations.]]></content:encoded>

The <a href = "http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [official website] <a href = "http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32698:mb-threatens-to-return-to-tahrir-square-if-supra-constitutional-articles-remain&catid=10388:paragraphs&Itemid=858">organized the protests earlier this week</a> [press release] in an attempt to force the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] to "intervene and withdraw the supra-constitutional principles proposed by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Elselmy." The MB believes the <a href = "http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32662&catid=10412&Itemid=692">proposed law</a> [text] would integrate the military into the political system in violation of the <a href = "http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/default.aspx">constitution</a> [text]. Since the protests began, reportedly more than <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/26969/Egypt/Politics-/Live-Updates-Egypts-police-forcibly-disperses-prot.aspx">500 people have been injured and 18 arrested</a> [Al Ahram report]. Struggles began when <a href = "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119161556860447.html">riot police attempted to dismantle a tent camp</a> [Al Jazeera report] memorializing activists killed in the revolution. Latest reports reveal that protesters were attempting to storm the <a href = "http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of the Interior</A> [official website] and were deterred by police firing rubber bullets. 

<p>Many fear the recent protests will impede upcoming elections. The November 28 election is considered the first free election following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak in February. Earlier this week, the Egypt Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-court-suspends-verdict-banning-officials-from-election.php">suspended a verdict</a> [JURIST report] handed down last week by the Mansoura Administrative Court that prohibited former officials of the National Democratic Party (NDP) to participate in the upcoming election. As a result, most of the officials who joined other parties or plan to run independently are now allowed to continue their campaigns for the election. This month, Egypt stated that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-to-amend-constitution-to-extend-voting-rights-to-citizens-abroad.php">amend its constitution</a> [JURIST report] based on a court ruling from a week before in order to allow citizens living abroad to vote in the parliamentary election. In addition, the SCAF announced that it will create a law that will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-military-council-to-ratify-anti-corruption-law.php">ban</a> [JURIST report] anyone found guilty of corruption from the election process. Mubarak himself is faced with charges of complicity in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">deaths of more than 800 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive]. His trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] last month and will not resume until December 28. Also last month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-overturns-ban-on-religious-based-political-party.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a ban prohibiting formation of religious-based political parties. Some restrictions, however, still exist in the election process such as prohibition of using <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-bans-use-of-religious-slogans-in-elections.php">religious slogans</a> [JURIST report] during campaigns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban also congratulated Sein on the country's strive toward democracy, as well as its naming as new chair of the <a href = "http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN). The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC) last week urged Sein to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/myanmar-rights-body-urges-release-of-political-prisoners.php">release political prisoners</a> [JURIST report]. In an open letter to Sein published in three state-owned newspapers, the MNHRC indicated that domestic and international support would follow the prisoners' release. Sein had granted amnesty to 6,359 prisoners in October following a similar open letter issued by the MNHRC. Ban welcomed the release of political prisoners by Sein last month, while <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-urged-to-release-remaining-political-prisoners.php">urging the government to release all political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] in accordance with the rule of law. It was also announced last week that US Secretary of State <a href = "http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] would be visiting the nation next month. Ban's visit will be finalized within the next few months.

<p>Last month, US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that Myanmar's civilian-led government was planning dramatic changes including <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-to-free-hundreds-of-political-prisoners.php">releasing hundreds of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and consequential dialogue with pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. Myanmar has sought to improve its international reputation following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">formed the MNHRC</a> [JURIST report] in September to promote and safeguard the country's constitutional rights. In August, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana urged the government of Myanmar to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">investigate human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and improve its rights record. In May, Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-releasing-nearly-15000-prisoners-after-un-visit.php">began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The seven commission members, appointed by Rousseff, must complete the report within two years. Rousseff also signed a law that limits the amount of time certain documents can be kept from the public to 50 years, allowing Brazilians the right to obtain undisclosed government information.

<p>In August <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-urged-to-revoke-amnesty-law.php">urged Brazil to repeal its amnesty law</a> [JURIST report].

Mladic would nevertheless be tried on all 11 charges, including two counts of genocide.

Discussions regarding the location of the trial are expected to take place soon, amid concerns that attempts to try him outside of Libya could prove very unpopular. The <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] has made statements addressing its expectations that the trial will be held in Libya.

<p>ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said Saturday that <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7MJ0CQ20111119">he will go to Libya in the next week</a> [Reuters report] to discuss Saif al-Islam's fate. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/show_personnel.php?office=2">Ottilia Maunganidze</a> [profile], a researcher at the <a href="http://www.iss.co.za/default.php">Institute for Security Studies</a> [website], wrote that the NTC must <a href="/hotline/2011/11/ottilia-maunganidze-gaddafi-investigation.php">meet its international obligations</a> [JURIST op-ed] and ensure justice for human rights violations by surrendering Saif al-Islam to the ICC. <a href="http://tupazlaw.com/profile.htm">Edsel Tupaz</a> of Tupaz &#38; Associates and <a href="http://www.countryrisksolutions.com/bio.html">Daniel Wagner</a> [profiles] of Country Risk Solutions wrote this month that while Libya needs a "strategically targeted court system" with a <a href="/sidebar/2011/11/tupaz-wagner-libya-transition.php">specialized war crimes court</a> [JURIST op-ed] at its core, currently there is no avoiding "the fact that there are no domestic judicial mechanisms [in Libya] ... to enforce the voice of the ICC." Ocampo last month stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-has-evidence-against-gaddafi-son-for-planning-civilian-attacks.php">has evidence against Saif al-Islam</a> [JURIST report] for his role in planning attacks on Libyan civilians. According to Ocampo there is "substantial evidence" that Saif al-Islam hired mercenaries to assist him in carrying out plans to attack demonstrators that protested the rule of his father. Libyan rebel leaders <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">allegedly captured Saif al-Islam</a> [JURIST report] in August, but he was free by September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The summary <a href="http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX_English_PR.pdf">highlights a number of options</a> [press release] available to policymakers to decrease the risk of disasters as well as to lessen their impact in areas that have historically been more vulnerable than others. One key finding contained within the summary relates to the effect of increased greenhouse gases, which many scientists attribute to the increase in maximum and minimum daily temperatures. The summary also indicates that those communities that are the most vulnerable and thus experience the most exposure to these types of disasters are "generally the outcome of skewed development processes such as those associated with environmental degradation, rapid and unplanned urbanization in hazardous areas, failures of governance, and the scarcity of livelihood options for the poor." As a result, the summary calls on policymakers to consider a range of measures in order to better manage the risks posed by extreme events and disasters, from sustainable land management and land use planning to improvements in governance and technology. The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203699404577046150347608214.html">summary was released</a> [WSJ report] weeks before global environmental officials will gather in Durban, South Africa, for climate-change talks. The full report is set to be released in February 2012.

<p>In July, the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] made their <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/security-council-declares-global-warming-threat-to-international-security.php">first official statement</a> [JURIST report] implicating climate change as a serious threat to world peace and security. At the urging of Germany, which released a <a href="http://www.new-york-un.diplo.de/Vertretung/newyorkvn/en/__pr/Press_20releases/PM__2011/110719_20Impact_20of_20Climate_20Change.html?archive=2990092">Concept Note</a> [text] to lead the discussion, the Security Council debated <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/">global warming</a> [EPA materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=global+warming">news archive</a>] for the first time since 2007. Although Germany pushed for plans of action to be produced on extreme temperatures, rising sea-levels, climate refugees and food shortages, the Council ended up issuing a brief statement instead. The language was reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14229237">not as strong as some of the nations wanted</a> [BBC report], as Russia pushed for the phrase "possible security implications" in the official text, and denied the other countries the creation of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/20/un-climate-change-peacekeeping">"green helmets" peacekeeping force</a> [Guardian report] that would step into conflicts where environmental resources become scarce. The statement did affirm that depleting resources has been, and will continue to be, the cause of several international conflicts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution will have two days for opening statements followed by half a day of opening statements for the defense. The first segment of the trial is expected to conclude by December 16 for Christmas recess and will resume after the holiday break on January 9. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11623&LangID=E">welcomed the opening of the trial</a> [press release].

<p>In October, defense lawyers for Nuon <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/khmer-rouge-leader-defense-team-files-suit-against-cambodia-pm.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] for interfering with the UN-backed war crimes tribunal.

The company is also seeking compensation for the loss of value of its trademarks and Australian investments. The new labeling requirements were <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/australia-senate-passes-law-banning-cigarette-brand-labels.php">passed by the Australian Senate</a> [JURIST report] last week followed by the <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr11-nr-nr243.htm">passage in the Australian House</a> [press release] on Monday. One hour after the legislation passed, PMA, a Hong Kong based company, filed a Notice of Arbitration under Australia's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.hk/IPPAAustraliae.PDF">Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong</a> [text, PDF] which was signed in 1993. PMA spokesperson Anne Edwards commented on the announcement:<blockquote>We are left with no option. The Government has passed this legislation despite being unable to demonstrate that it will be effective at reducing smoking and has ignored the widespread concerns raised in Australia and internationally regarding the serious legal issues associated with plain packaging.</blockquote>The new regulations require that cigarettes be sold in generic, olive green packages, without branding or logos. The packages will also have <a href="http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-label-images">graphic warnings</a> [AUS Health Dept. backgrounder] of the potential health risks of smoking.

<p>Tobacco packaging is at issue in the US as well. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] granted a temporary injunction to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-tobacco-label-requirements.php">block the implementation</a> [JURIST report] of new requirements of graphic image and textual warning labels imposed by the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text]. A group of four tobacco companies had <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/tobacco-companies-challenge-cigarette-labeling-regulations.php">sued the US government</a> [JURIST report] in August claiming that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/CigaretteWarningLabels/default.htm">new cigarette labeling regulations</a> [FDA materials] violate their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the FSPTCA into law</a> [JURIST report], granting the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first suspect in this trial is Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a former member of Parliament in the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">National Assembly of Bangladesh</a> [official website, in Bengali] and one of the leaders of the Bangladesh <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/index.php">Jamaat-e-Islami party</a> [official website, <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">GlobalSecurity backgrounder</a>]. He has been <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Bangladesh/Bangladesh-1971-war-crimes-trial-begins/Article1-771835.aspx">charged with 20 crimes</a> [<em>Hindustan Times</em> report] contained in the <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973</a> [text, PDF] including genocide, arson, rape and torture. If Sayedee is found guilty, he will face the death penalty. Four other leaders from Sayedee's Jamaat-e-Islami party and two from the <a href="http://www.bnp-bd.com/news.php">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP) [official website] are also facing trials in the near future.

<p>The trial is the result of consistent effort and persistence of the ICTB. Last week, ICTB prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-political-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed an application</a> [JURIST report] for formal charges against a former leader who allegedly committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War. This application was filed in response to ICTB's <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-formal-charges.php">request</a> [JURIST report] for a submission of formal charges. However, the trial process faced some concerns when <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] pointed to reports showing threats of violence and arrest against defense lawyers and witnesses. HRW urged Bangladesh to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-urged-to-stop-harassment-of-defense-counsel-at-war-crimes-tribunal.php">stop such harassment</a> [JURIST report] in order to have a legitimate trial against the accused. The trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-delayed.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] last month because the defense lawyers asked the court to review the charges against Sayedee. The court <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2011/10/2011103010158155404.html">accepted 20 out of 31 charges</a> [Al Jazeera report] that were <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bangladesh-prosecutors-charge-islamic-leader-with-war-crimes.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in July by the Bangladesh prosecutors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

David Bram, 27, for a list of charges stemming from his attempt to cover up drug use in his platoon and also to kill Afghan civilians. Bram was <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/11/18/1912065/sergeant-found-guilty-hes-11th.html">sentenced to five years in prison</a> [<em>News Tribune</em> report] for solicitation to commit premeditated murder and failure to report crimes including murder. He was found not guilty on charges relating to an alleged incident where he planted an AK-47 magazine near an Afghan civilian after he shot and killed him in January 2010. Bram is the sixth soldier from the 5th Stryker Brigade to be charged in connection with the three Afghan deaths, which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. A military investigation revealed that soldiers from the brigade had been plotting since 2009 to kill unarmed Afghans and stage them to look like casualties of combat. Another soldier, Specialist Jeremy Morlock <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to three counts of murder as well as single counts of assault, conspiracy, obstructing justice and illegal drug use in exchange for a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison. Morlock described Bram's involvement in his plea agreement, claiming that Bram overhead other soldiers planning civilian deaths and told Morlock that it was clear to go ahead with one of the killings in January 2010. Bram faced up to 21 years in prison if convicted of all charges against him. 

<p>This does not mark the first time Bram will face charges before a military tribunal for misconduct. Bram was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">court-martialed last year</a> [JURIST report] for charges unrelated to the murders. He was accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep the soldier from informing superiors about alleged drug abuse within the unit. The charges included conspiracy to commit assault and battery, unlawfully striking another soldier, violating a lawful order, dereliction of duty, cruelty, maltreatment and endeavoring to impede an investigation. The probe into 12 members of the 5th Stryker Brigade regarding the civilian deaths <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">began in May 2010</a> [JURIST report]. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens, another member of the brigade, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty in December</a> [JURIST report] to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrorizing civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The rights experts, including the UN special rapporteurs on summary executions, freedom of expression, human rights defenders and freedom of peaceful assembly issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11629&LangID=E">joint statement</a> [text] "express[ing] alarm at the degree of violence and deterioration of the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association which have led to loss of life in Egypt." The secretary-general's <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5701">statement</a> [text] reads in its entirety:<blockquote>The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the violence in Egypt during the last few days, particularly in Cairo. He deplores the loss of life and the many injuries. The Secretary-General calls on the transitional authorities to guarantee the protection of human rights and civil liberties for all Egyptians, including the right to peaceful protest. He urges restraint and calm by all parties to enable a peaceful and inclusive electoral process as part of Egypt's transition to democracy and the early establishment of civilian rule."</blockquote>Many fear the recent protests will impede upcoming elections. The November 28 election is considered the first free election following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive] in February.

<p>As many as 50,000 protesters took to Tahrir Square in Egypt on Friday, decrying the military's continued rule over the nation since this year's revolution, and on Saturday were reportedly met with a violent reprisal from police forces. The <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website] <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32698:mb-threatens-to-return-to-tahrir-square-if-supra-constitutional-articles-remain&catid=10388:paragraphs&Itemid=858">organized the protests earlier this week</a> [press release] in an attempt to force the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] to "intervene and withdraw the supra-constitutional principles proposed by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Elselmy." The MB believes the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32662&catid=10412&Itemid=692">proposed law</a> [text] would integrate the military into the political system in violation of the <a href="http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/default.aspx">constitution</a> [text]. Since the protests began, reportedly more than <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/26969/Egypt/Politics-/Live-Updates-Egypts-police-forcibly-disperses-prot.aspx">500 people have been injured and 18 arrested</a> [Al Ahram report].

Ocampo will meet with Libyan officials to find out what their national plan for trials and proceedings are, as well as discuss where the two men will be tried for international crimes. Ocampo said:<blockquote>Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi must face justice. ... Their arrest is a crucial step in bringing to justice those most responsible for crimes committed in Libya. This is not a military or political issue, it is a legal requirement.</blockquote>Ocampo also said that it will ultimately be up to ICC judges to decide where the trials will be held.

If convicted, repercussions would include a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/21/uk-egypt-election-army-idUKTRE7AK1BR20111121">five-year bar from joining political life</a> [Reuters report], removal from any positions of leadership and the loss of one's membership in parliament and local counsel. Protesters criticized the military's announcement for being "too little, too late" and expressed fear that criminal action would be too slow to prevent former members of Hosni Mubarak's party, the National Democratic Party (NDP), from running in and impeding the upcoming election. Egypt's deputy prime minister for political development Ali al-Selmi said that the law <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-military-council-to-ratify-anti-corruption-law.php">would apply to officials</a> [JURIST report] who are found guilty of financial crimes and abuse of power including officials elected to parliament. However, there is still concern that without an official ban on former NDP members, who have used wealth and connections to secure parliamentary seats in the past to advance personal interests, they may once again regain power. Elections for the lower house of parliament are set to begin on November 28.

<p>Proposals for this amendment to the Egyptian political corruption law were criticized by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] in October for their <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-political-corruption-law-amendments-have-potential-for-abuse-hrw.php">potential for abuse</a> [JURIST report]. HRW reported that the amendments, proposed by the <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/">Egyptian Cabinet of Ministers</a> [official website], would allow authorities to imprison anyone convicted of crimes involving "political corruption," which the organization alleges are vaguely defined, as well as deprive convicted persons of their rights to vote and run for office. As a result of this vague definition, HRW feared individuals will be convicted simply for association with certain political groups and not on the basis of actual criminal activity. While HRW recognized the interest the new government has in keeping corrupt former officials from affecting the direction the country's government takes into the future, it maintained that these amendments are too arbitrary to be effective in this way. Instead, HRW recommends that Egypt refrain from basing judgments on the ability to hold political authority on past or present associations and require clear and convincing evidence that the "individual in question knowingly and actively furthered criminal practices of the organization." The proposals at issue seek to amend the country's 1952 "Law on Political Treachery," which would be renamed "The Political Corruption Law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=9186">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [party website], which holds a majority in the NA, was responsible for pushing the legislation through by a vote of 229-107. The bill would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/22/safrica-secrecy-idUSL5E7MM30L20111122">criminalize the possession and distribution</a> [Reuters report] of information valuable to the state and could impose imprisonment of up to 25 years. The bill has received extensive criticism for being reminiscent of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/12chapter7.shtml">Apartheid</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=apartheid">news archive</a>] legislation and exposing the country to potential corruption. Nobel Prize recipient <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/mandela_nelson.shtml">Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a> [BBC profile] has publicly criticized the bill by labeling it <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15822105">insulting to the field of journalism</a> [BBC report] and a step backwards from achieving democracy. The bill must pass through the National Council of Provinces for <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201111220565.html">further consideration</a> [All Africa report] and obtain the signature of the president.  

<p>Other nations have also struggled with balancing citizens' rights with the need to protect state secrets. In August, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] invoked the state secrets privilege to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/us-ag-holder-invokes-state-secrets-privilege-in-mosque-surveillance-lawsuit.php">block evidence</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit against the FBI over its investigation into Muslim mosques. Holder had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/holder-orders-doj-review-of-us-state.php">ordered a review</a> [JURIST report] of all government claims invoking the state secrets privilege in 2009. Last year, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/china-amends-state-secrets-law-to.php">Chinese government revised</a> [JURIST report] its often-criticized state secrets law to require Internet and telecommunications companies to inform on customers who share state secrets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The admission is a reversal of the country's previous characterization of its crackdown on protesters. Prior to this admission, the Bahraini government <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/world/meast/bahrain-unrest/index.html?eref=rss_world">defended its actions</a> [CNN report], which allegedly resulted in the deaths of more than 30 protesters, as necessary to maintain public safety.  The government's statement comes just days before a report is expected on the findings of the <a href="http://www.bici.org.bh/">Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry</a> (BICI) [official website] is set to be released. The BICI, assembled by <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official proflie], is tasked with conducting an investigation into the treatment of protesters by government officials. The BICI report is expected to be released Wednesday.

<p>Bahrain continues to deal with the fallout from the pro-democracy protests earlier this year. Last month, a Bahrain court began <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-court-hears-appeals-of-20-convicted-medics.php">hearing the appeals of 20 medical staff members</a> [JURIST report] who were convicted in September of participating in the protests against the ruling regime. Earlier in October, Bahrain granted <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-grants-retrials-to-20-convicted-medics.php">retrials</a> for the medics who were convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-military-court-setences-protesters-medical-workers.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] by the National Safety Court of Appeal to terms ranging from five to 10 years imprisonment. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests.  In April, human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain for rampant human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] related to anti-government protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report alleges that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] has used violence and torture to put down government protests and discourage political dissent. The report criticizes SCAF for its conduct despite its repeated promises to protect free expression and encourage political openness. AI expressed concern that the human rights violations may be equal to those committed under former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive]:<blockquote>In the name of ensuring security and stability, the authorities have committed numerous human rights violations, ignoring the very demands for social justice and fundamental freedoms that triggered the uprising. Indeed, 10 months later, the SCAF has been moving further and further from meeting the human rights demands voiced by millions of Egyptians during the "25 January Revolution" and the promises that ensued from it. Since February, the SCAF have issued a number of laws that have been detrimental to the protection of human rights. Some were meant to appease sentiments of insecurity ... others appear aimed at discouraging criticism of the authorities and protest. The recent endorsement in full of the Emergency Law and its expansion ... has been considered the greatest erosion of rights since the January uprising.</blockquote>AI has called for SCAF to end impunity for military officials who abuse Egyptians and to allow an independent agency to investigate alleged human rights violations. Also Tuesday, the Egyptian military announced its intention to <a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2011/11/22/ap-egyptian-military-pledges-to-transfer-power-to-civilian-government-by-july-2012/">turn over governing power by July 1, 2012</a> [AP report]. 

<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] and a group of independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-experts-urge-restraint-in-egypt.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] "express[ing] alarm at the degree of violence and deterioration of the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association which have led to loss of life in Egypt." Last Friday, as many as <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-protesters-decry-ruling-military-council-clash-with-police.php">50,000 protesters took to Tahrir Square in Egypt</a> [JURIST report], decrying the military's continued rule over the nation since this year's revolution, and on Saturday were reportedly met with a violent reprisal from police forces. The <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website] <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32698:mb-threatens-to-return-to-tahrir-square-if-supra-constitutional-articles-remain&catid=10388:paragraphs&Itemid=858">organized the protests earlier this week</a> [press release] in an attempt to force the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to "intervene and withdraw the supra-constitutional principles proposed by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Elselmy." The MB believes the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/iweb/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32662&catid=10412&Itemid=692">proposed law</a> [text] would integrate the military into the political system in violation of the <a href="http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/default.aspx">constitution</a> [text]. Since the protests began, reportedly more than <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/26969/Egypt/Politics-/Live-Updates-Egypts-police-forcibly-disperses-prot.aspx">500 people have been injured and 18 arrested</a> [Al Ahram report]. Struggles began when riot police attempted to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119161556860447.html">dismantle a tent camp</a> [Al Jazeera report] memorializing activists killed in the revolution. Latest reports reveal that protesters were attempting to storm the <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website] and were deterred by police firing rubber bullets. Many fear the recent protests will impede upcoming elections. The November 28 election is considered the first free election following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Court of Appeals ordered <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/People/Ministers/SecretaryOfStateForDefence.htm">Defence Secretary Liam Fox</a> [official website] to reconsider his refusal to open a single public inquiry into allegations of UK military abuse. The Court of Appeals also found that the existing inquiries into the abuse allegations fail to meet the requirements of <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art3">Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] which protects against inhumane treatment. This decision reverses a UK High Court decision from December 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/uk-court-denies-public-inquiry-into-iraq-detainee-abuse.php">denying the appeal</a> [JURIST report] of  more than 100 Iraqi citizens to open a single public inquiry into allegations of abuse by members of the British Armed Forces. The High Court previously held that the inquiries initiated by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT) were sufficient and that further public inquiry would be unnecessary in this case. Lead claimant Ali Zaki Mousa <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/news_details.php?id=195">said</a> [press release] that the decision "has restored our confidence in the British people."

<p>The hearings into Fox's refusal to open public inquiries <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-court-begins-iraq-detainee-abuse-hearings.php">began in November 2010</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/">Public Interest Lawyers</a> (PIL) [law firm website], the group representing the Iraqi civilians, submitted videos to support claims that UK soldiers and interrogators abused Iraqi detainees in British internment facilities. In September 2010, a <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] report found that the UK's <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/uk-defense-ministry-report-finds-little-wrong-with-detainee-treatment.php">treatment of detainees complies with domestic and international law</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2010, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">create a panel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate claims that British government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas. The investigation stems from a civil action, brought by 12 ex-detainees who allege that British agents participated in their abuse while they were held in prisons in Pakistan, Morocco and other countries. The UK will ask them to drop their lawsuits in exchange for possible compensation and a promise that the impending inquiry will fully investigate their claims. In June, the UK government indicated that it will issue a new set of regulations regarding the use of information <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">obtained via torture</a> [JURIST report] as claims of complicity in torture were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">report</a> [materials] released the same day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The trial lasted only four hours before being adjourned to await a decision from Turkey's high court about whether the presiding judge can hear the case amid allegations by the defense counsel that the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkish-journalists-stand-trial-15004117">judge lacks impartiality</a> [AP report]. After re-convening December 26, the court will decide whether the journalists, who have been in jail for nine months, will be released. Two of the defendants are accused of being part of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>], a secular group suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. The 13 journalists claim that the charges are no more than an attempt to silence opposition based on allegedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15836733">fabricated evidence</a> [BBC report]. However, the government maintains that the charges are based solely on the defendants' criminal activities and not the writings or words of the journalists. The case has sparked division in Turkey over media rights in the country.

<p>In August, a Turkish court issued <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/turkish-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-seven-military-officers.php">arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for seven generals and admirals accused of creating anti-government websites in 2009. A number of other senior military officials are in detention for a separate investigation of the <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/darbenin-adi-balyoz.htm">Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> (also known as "Operation Sledgehammer") [Taraf report, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sledgehammer">news archive</a>], a military plot to overthrow the Islamic-rooted government. The "Sledgehammer" plot is similar to the Ergenekon conspiracy. The Ergenekon group is alleged to be involved in bombings, political assassination plots and the death of journalist Hrant Dink. The probe into the Ergenekon conspiracy has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence opposition and further its <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">imposition of Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report] in violation of Turkey's secular constitution. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">Trials against the Ergenekon group</a> [JURIST report] opened over two years ago with more than 200 suspects in custody. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's ruling affirmed the death sentence of a man convicted of murdering a 13-year old boy with a sledgehammer in 1997. In its defense of the death penalty, the court invoked provisions of the <a href="http://www.cslib.org/constitutionalamends/constitution.htm">Connecticut Constitution</a> [text] that permit capital punishment, declaring, "In article first, &#167; 8, and article first, &#167; 19, our state constitution makes repeated textual references to capital offenses and thus expressly sustains the constitutional validity of such a penalty in appropriate circumstances." The majority opinion claimed that these state constitutional provisions, which closely mirror the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am5">Fifth</a>, <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am6">Sixth</a> and <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am8">Eighth Amendments</a> [text] to the US constitution imply that the death penalty does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, nor does it violate persons' due process rights. The <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR303/303CR114E.pdf">dissenting judge</a> [text, PDF] disagreed with the majority's reasoning, posing the rhetorical question, "[has] our thirst for this ultimate penalty now been slaked, or do we, the people of Connecticut, continue down this increasingly lonesome road?" The court's decision could have a ripple effect on future death penalty jurisprudence in Connecticut.

<p>The death penalty continues to arouse legal, political and moral controversy nationwide. Two weeks ago, the US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear the case of a Texas death row inmate who was allegedly convicted partially on the basis of race. Earlier in November, the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it was forming a committee to ensure that the death penalty was not administered arbitrarily. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois abolished capital punishment</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=9265">concluding</a> [press release] that there was no way to rid the capital punishment system of its discriminatory flaws. In 2009, New Mexico <a href="/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">repealed its death penalty</a> [JURIST report] on similar grounds to Illinois, asserting that the state could not possibly administer the death penalty impartially. In 2005, the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/House.asp">Connecticut House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/connecticut-lawmakers-uphold-death.php">voted down legislation</a>[JURIST report] that would have eliminated the state's death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arroyo has denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit comes at a particularly difficult time for Arroyo after Philippine authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-charged-with-corruption-election-fraud.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] her on Saturday with electoral sabotage, a day after she was arrested on a <a href="http://travel-on-a-shoe-string.blogspot.com/2011/11/warrant-of-arrest-for-gma-text.html">warrant</a> [text] issued for charges of corruption and election fraud that occurred during her time as president.

<p>Last week, Arroyo and her husband attempted to leave the country after posting bond in order to seek medical treatment for Arroyo, but the government refused to allow them transit. In June, the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/index.php">Philippines Supreme Court</a> [official website] said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippine-high-court-to-allow-live-broadcast-of-maguindanao-massacre-trial.php">allow the live broadcast</a> [JURIST report] of the November 2009 Maguindanao Massacre trial subject to guidelines set by the court. The court decided to allow broadcast coverage in this particular situation involving the trial of several members of a clan accused of killing 57 people, including 31 journalists, supporting a rival political candidate. Earlier in June, a Philippine court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippines-court-freezes-23-million-assets-of-massacre-suspects.php">froze USD $23 million worth of assets</a> [JURIST report] owned by the Ampatuan family, who are accused of ordering the 2009 slayings, while investigators determine how the Ampatuans accumulated accumulated the assets. </p>]]></content:encoded>

These patents relate to HTC's recently acquired subsidiary S3 Graphics Co. The USITC ruling rejects the request to limit imports of MAC computers, the iPhone and the iPad. The decision also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-21/apple-wins-patent-fight-with-s3-graphics-at-u-s-trade-agency.html">calls into question the rationale of the S3 acquisition</a> [Bloomberg report] and could put pressure on HTC stock shares. HTC said it may challenge the ruling in the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website], which specializes in patent law.

<p>In July, USITC ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">HTC infringed two Apple patents</a> [JURIST report] relating to the Android operating system.

Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. This complaint came just weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung filed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to prevent Apple from importing iPads and iPhones. Samsung claimed Apple violated five patents also related to smartphones and tablets.

Proposed by the <a href="http://www.bn.org.my/alliance.html">National Front</a> [party website], Malaysia's ruling party, and supported by <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&page=1926">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile], the bill, known as the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hPAK-odN_LwEJsV85VbF9ZNtGKRA?docId=7363cd456ab54b5ab927f9fc832989ee">Peaceful Assembly Bill</a> [AP report], is expected to pass through Parliament quickly, and will require demonstrators to give police a 30-day notice of any protest. The police may then impose restrictions on the protest at their discretion, and even reject the proposed time and place for the demonstration. Additionally, street demonstrations are prohibited, as are protests near schools, hospitals, or places of worship. Statements made during protests cannot "promote ill will," and protesters can be fined up to 20,000 ringgit, or $6,200, if they break any of the rules. Although the ruling government party believes that the bill allows Malaysians to express concerns without putting public safety at risk, opposition leaders have accused Razak of reneging on his promise to make Malaysia a freer and more liberal society. Though he did not echo this opinion, Lim Chee Wee, President of the <a href="http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/bar_council.html">Malaysian Bar</a> [advocacy website], stated that "[i]n its present form, the Bill is more restrictive than present law, and must be improved." Wee then <a href="http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/press_statements/press_release_peaceful_assembly_bill_is_more_restrictive_than_present_law_and_must_be_improved.html">recommended several amendments</a> [press release] that could potentially make the bill more conforming to the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/malaysia.pdf">Malayasian constitution</a> [text, PDF].

<p>The introduction of the Peaceful Assembly Bill comes just after <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malayasia-pm-initiates-repeal-of-security-laws.php">Razak repealed Malaysia's widely criticized internal security laws</a> [JURIST report], which allowed the imprisonment of individuals deemed to be national security threats for up to two years without trial. Although the prime minister has pledged that his administration will protect civil liberties, the Malaysian government has previously been criticized in response to its handling of protesters. In July, UN Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression Frank La Rue <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11225&LangID=E">asserted</a> [press release] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-says-malaysia-used-heavy-handed-response-to-protests.php">Malaysia's response to protests on July 9</a> [JURIST report] was too strong, and that such actions restrict the freedom of association while hindering the democratic process. In support of his claim, La Rue pointed to reports that the harsh reaction from Malaysian authorities resulted in injuries, at least one death, and more than 1,600 arrests in the nation's capital of Kuala Lumpur.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The duo was found guilty on charges in connection to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq after a four-day hearing. The trials, headed by former Malaysian premier <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile], a vocal critic of the Iraq conflict since its inception, have no enforcement power under international or domestic rule of law.

<p>Various human rights groups have filed charges against US and UK officials alleging war crimes committed in Afghanistan and Iraq. In October, the attorney general for British Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-ag-blocks-bush-torture-suit.php">blocked a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by the <a href="http://www.ccij.ca/index-e.php">Canadian Centre for International Justice</a> [advocacy website] against Bush on torture allegations. Earlier in October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] urged the Canadian government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-urge-canada-to-arrest-ex-us-president-bush-ahead-of-visit.php">investigate and arrest</a> [JURIST report] Bush for his role in torture. In February, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.eu/">European Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy websites] urged the signatory states of the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Bush. Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">rejected consistently by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010, a former UN official <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-un-rights-expert-urges-afghanistan-war-crimes-investigation.php">strongly suggested</a> [JURIST report] a war crimes investigation of actions by both sides in the Afghanistan war.

Walker, who <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">initially overturned Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report], is a gay man who has been in a committed same-sex relationship for 10 years. Although it was an open secret at the time of trial, Walker did not reveal this until retiring after the ruling. Supporters of Proposition 8, who <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/california-high-court-rules-proposition-8-sponsors-may-defend-it-in-court.php">won the right to defend the law</a> [JURIST report] last week, declared this a conflict of interest that should have forced his recusal, as Walker's long-term relationship implied a vested interest in same-sex marriage being legalized. The only Proposition 8-related matter not consolidated into this hearing is now the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-stays-release-of-proposition-8-trial-videos.php">release of the original trial videos</a> [JURIST report]. It is speculated the consolidation is designed to <a href = "http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-consider-prop.html">provide a clean appeal to the Supreme Court</a> [<em>Metro Weekly</em> report] regardless of how the Ninth Circuit rules.

<p>The battle over Proposition 8, a ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to ban <a href = "/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive], continues, awaiting a ruling from the the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_vid=0000006121">heard oral arguments</a> [video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000472">Perry v. Brown</a> [case materials] at the end of 2010. The hearing was divided into two one-hour sessions, with the first section focusing on the issue of standing, and the second focusing on Proposition 8's constitutionality. In March, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending. Walker's ruling in August 2010 held that the ban violated both the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] of the Fourteenth Amendment and held that same-sex marriage was required as part of the fundamental right to marriage affirmed by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a> [text].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in March by Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor.The DOJ argues that the law is preempted by federal law because it attempts to establish a state-specific immigration policy. In its complaint, the DOJ said:<blockquote>Utah's adoption of its own immigration policy disrupts the federal government's ability both to administer and enforce the federal immigration laws including as set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act, and to establish and pursue federal policies and priorities pertaining to, inter alia, the identification, apprehension, detention and removal of aliens unlawfully in the United States. By contributing to this state-specific immigration policy, the challenged provisions of H.B. 497 represent an attempt to regulate in an area constitutionally reserved to the federal government, forcing a conflict with the federal immigration laws and federal immigration policy, interfering with federal primacy in managing the nation's foreign affairs and in balancing the competing objectives of immigration policy, and impeding the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Sections 3, 10, and 11 of H.B. 497 are therefore preempted.</blockquote>A judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked the Utah law</a> in May, less than 24 hours after it took effect, following a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">challenge</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> [advocacy websites] and other plaintiffs.

<p>The DOJ has filed similar suits challenging immigration laws in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">South Carolina</a> [JURIST reports]. Federal judges have enjoined portions of each of those laws, and an appeal of the Arizona law is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">pending before the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ is reviewing similar immigration legislation passed recently in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2011/November/20111114024353852.pdf">agreement</a> [text, PDF] includes $321 million in criminal fines and $628 million in civil fines as well as submitting a guilty plea to an <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2011/November/20111114024303194.pdf">information</a> [text, PDF] filed by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/index.html">US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts</a> (USAO) [official website]. The one-count information was filed against Merck for promoting <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vioxx">Vioxx</a> [JURIST news archive] for use against rheumatoid arthritis before receiving <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a> [official website] approval. Merck has also entered into a corporate integrity agreement through which procedures will be put into place to prevent and detect any violations of company policy or law. Merck said the settlement does <a href="http://www.merck.com/newsroom/news-release-archive/corporate/2011_1122.html">not constitute an admission of any liability or wrongdoing</a> [press release] and the company believes they "acted responsibly and in good faith in connection with the conduct at issue." The USAO <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2011/November/MerckPR.html">said</a> [press release] they "will continue to work with law enforcement partners to aggressively investigate and prosecute pharmaceutical companies&#8212;no matter how large&#8212;when they improperly market their products."

<p>Vioxx was pulled from the market in September 2004 after it was discovered that it led to an increased risk of heart attack. In June 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-finds-for-merck-in-louisiana-vioxx-suit.php">federal judge in Louisiana found for Merck</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit over reimbursements for the prescription painkiller Vioxx filed by the <a href="http://www.ag.state.la.us/">Louisiana Attorney General's Office</a> [official website] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/florida-joins-deceptive-marketing.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] by the state of Florida in 2008. Other lawsuits were filed in <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-jury-finds-merck-not-liable-in.php">Louisiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/jury-deadlock-in-california-vioxx-case.php">California</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/new-jersey-jury-awards-20-million-in.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/texas-appeals-court-overturns-jury.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports]. In April 2010, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-vioxx-fraud-suit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a securities fraud claim filed against Vioxx had not passed its statute of limitations and could proceed.

In November 2007, Merck said that it had <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/merck-to-pay-485b-to-settle-all-pending.php">agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle</a> [JURIST report] all pending lawsuits regarding its marketing and distribution of Vioxx.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It also, "Calls upon the Syrian authorities to immediately put an end to all human rights violations, to protect their population and to fully comply with their obligations under international human rights law, and calls for an immediate end to
all violence in the Syrian Arab Republic." The nations that sponsored the resolution hope it will be a first step in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15834540">bringing the matter back before the UN Security Council</a> [BBC report].

The state has executed only two individuals in the last 49 years and each execution was with the prisoner's consent. Kitzhaber said, "I do not believe that those executions made us safer; and certainly they did not make us nobler as a society." He stated:<blockquote>Oregonians have a fundamental belief in fairness and justice&#8212;in swift and certain justice. The death penalty as practiced in Oregon is neither fair nor just; and it is not swift or certain. It is not applied equally to all. It is a perversion of justice that the single best indicator of who will and will not be executed has nothing to do with the circumstances of a crime or the findings of a jury. The only factor that determines whether someone sentenced to death in Oregon is actually executed is that they volunteer. ... I am calling on the legislature to bring potential reforms before the 2013 legislative session and encourage all Oregonians to engage in the long overdue debate that this important issue deserves.</blockquote>Kitzhaber said that is "convinced we can find a better solution that keeps society safe, supports the victims of crime and their families and reflects Oregon values."

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue across the US. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/connecticut-high-court-upholds-states-death-penalty-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's death penalty law. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it was forming a committee to ensure that the death penalty is <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">not administered arbitrarily</a> [JURIST report]. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois abolished capital punishment</a> [JURIST report], concluding that there was no way to rid the capital punishment system of its discriminatory flaws. In 2009, New Mexico <a href="/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">repealed its death penalty</a> [JURIST report] on similar grounds to Illinois, asserting that the state could not possibly administer the death penalty impartially.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noriega faces charges of human rights violations in Panama for crimes allegedly committed during his 1981-1989 rule. He was already convicted on three counts of human rights violations <em>in absentia</em>, and each count carries a 20-year prison sentence. Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] and Panamanian authorities have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">seeking Noriega's extradition</a>  [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama since April 2010.

He was convicted of laundering $3 million in drug profits by purchasing property in Paris. In April 2010, Noriega was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges, after <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fighting extradition</a> [JURIST report] since 2007. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega's petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> in February 2010 after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] on the case a month earlier.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontbahrain.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Bahrain authorities used excessive force and tortured detainees involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year, according to a <a href="http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Tuesday by an independent Bahraini government commission. The report, published by the <a href="http://www.bici.org.bh/">Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry</a> (BICI) [official website], concluded that the security forces "violated the principles of necessity and proportionality" in their choice of weapons and in their disregard for the safety of bystanders during the protests. The report further concludes that detained protesters were subject to physical torture, both as a punishment and as a means to coerce confessions. BICI maintains that the government is accountable for the conduct of its security:<blockquote>The Government believed that the domestic situation reached a point
that was threatening the complete breakdown of law and order...A State of National Safety was declared in Bahrain [to restore] public order...The security forces carried out [arrests] without presenting an arrest warrant or informing the arrested individual of the reasons for arrest. In many cases, the security services of the [government of Bahrain] resorted to the use of unnecessary and excessive force, terror-inspiring behaviour and unnecessary damage to property. The fact that a systematic pattern of behaviour existed indicates that this is how these security forces were trained and were expected to behave. </blockquote>
The commission stated that the security forces acted with an expectation of impunity for their actions. On Monday, the Bahrain government <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-admits-use-of-excessive-force-against-pro-democracy-protesters.php">admitted the use of excessive force</a> [JURIST report] in the protests. This admission, which was made in anticipation of the independent report, was a reversal of the government's previous <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/world/meast/bahrain-unrest/index.html?eref=rss_world">defense of its actions</a> [CNN report].

<p>Bahrain continues to deal with the fallout from the pro-democracy protests earlier this year. Last month, a Bahrain court began <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-court-hears-appeals-of-20-convicted-medics.php">hearing the appeals of 20 medical staff members</a> [JURIST report] who were convicted in September of participating in the protests against the ruling regime.

The law was under challenge by two bishops of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) who claimed that the law infringed on their religious freedom and was not consistent with the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. The court held, however, that:<blockquote>[T]he salutary effects of the prohibition far outweigh the deleterious. The law seeks to advance the institution of monogamous marriage, a fundamental value in Western society from the earliest of times. It seeks to protect against the many harms which are reasonably apprehended to arise out of the practice of polygamy. Finally, and not insignificantly, the prohibition is consistent with, and furthers, Canada&#8217;s international human rights obligations. In my view, this adds very significant weight to the salutary effects side of the balance.</blockquote>The court found that there were "a consistent set of harms associated with polygamy," including a higher rate of sexual and physical abuse of women and higher rates of abuse, neglect and emotional problems for children. These harms, the court said, outweighed the "minimal" impact on religious freedom. The bishops' sect of the FLDS has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/world/americas/british-columbia-court-upholds-canadas-polygamy-ban.html">linked to the Texas-based Yearning for Zion Ranch</a> [NYT report] from which authorities <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/us/02jeffs.html?scp=3&sq=yearning%20for%20zion%20ranch%20jeffs&st=cse">seized 468 children</a> [NYT report] in 2008. The court stated that the law should not apply to minors however.

<p>Polygamy has been an issue throughout the world. In July a polygamous family brought suit challenging Utah's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/utah-polygamy-law-challenged-in-federal-lawsuit.php">ban on bigamy</a> [JURIST report] as an unconstitutional violation of their civil rights. Polygamy is currently legal and recognized in much of Africa and the Middle East, while it is widely illegal in North and South America, Europe and China. Polygamy&#8212;called bigamy when illegal&#8212; is criminalized in every state in the US. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</a> [official website] in 2008 urged <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saudi+arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href = "/paperchase/2008/02/un-rights-panel-urges-saudi-arabia-to.php">to outlaw polygamy</a> [JURIST report], which it said is by its very nature counter to gender equality. The year before Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/indonesia-high-court-upholds-limits-on.php">upheld marriage laws limiting polygamy</a> [JURIST report], despite teachings in the predominantly Islamic country's largest religion allowing men to take up to four wives. However, in 2006, a Canadian study <A href = "/paperchase/2006/01/canadian-study-recommends-legalizing.php">urged the Canadian federal government to legalize polygamy</a> [JURIST report] to help protect women and children in those relationships.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The SCAF also assured citizens that <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111124172835763439.html">arrested demonstrators would be released</a> [Al Jazeera report], possibly by Saturday. Protesters have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-protesters-decry-ruling-military-council-clash-with-police.php">clashing with Egyptian security forces for 6 days</a> [JURIST report] over concerns with actions taken by the military ruling council. The SCAF assured Egyptians that elections would begin on Monday as scheduled, despite the continuing protests.

<p>The November 28 election is considered the first free election following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak in February. Earlier this week, the Egypt Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-court-suspends-verdict-banning-officials-from-election.php">suspended a verdict</a> [JURIST report] handed down last week by the Mansoura Administrative Court that prohibited former officials of the National Democratic Party (NDP) to participate in the upcoming election. As a result, most of the officials who joined other parties or plan to run independently are now allowed to continue their campaigns for the election. This month, Egypt stated that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-to-amend-constitution-to-extend-voting-rights-to-citizens-abroad.php">amend its constitution</a> [JURIST report] based on a court ruling from a week before in order to allow citizens living abroad to vote in the parliamentary election. In addition, the SCAF announced that it will create a law that will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-military-council-to-ratify-anti-corruption-law.php">ban</a> [JURIST report] anyone found guilty of corruption from the election process. Mubarak himself is faced with charges of complicity in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">deaths of more than 800 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive].

The counting was initiated to counter several allegations of war crimes against the Sri Lankan military including those in an April UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">report</a>]. According to a census conducted with the <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.lk/">Department of Census and Statistics</a> [official website] that will be released in the near future, the number of civilian casualties are much smaller than those predicted by independent organizations. Rajapaksa continued in criticizing those who made the allegations against the Sri Lankan military:<blockquote>If the extremely well trained Sri Lankan military suffered 6,000 deaths and 25,000 serious injuries, it should be evident the number of LTTE casualties should be comparable or higher. However, this consideration gets almost no attention when allegations are made about the number of dead and missing during the conflict. It is almost as if those who make allegations about the deaths in battle are under the impression that the Sri Lankan military was fighting phantoms. The manifest absurdity of this underscores the lack of perspective of those who make these claims.</blockquote>The Secretary of Defence further stressed the professionalism of the Sri Lankan military minimizing the occurrence of crimes and its rapid response in dealing with such criminal acts.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009. This month, a former Sri Lankan army chief was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-former-army-chief-sentenced-to-three-more-years-for-implicating-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to an additional three years in prison for his comment to a local newspaper that the government of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3602101.stm">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [BBC profile] ordered the killing of surrendering rebel leaders during the civil war and therefore, was in breach of Sri Lanka's emergency laws effective at that time. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/former-sri-lanka-army-chief-fonseka-convicted-of-engaging-in-politics-while-on-duty.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] in August due to his involvement in politics while active on duty. Sri Lankan government was also subject to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In October, a group of human rights organizations and lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/australia-urged-to-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Australian government to start its investigations in Canberra against a former Sri Lankan Navy admiral for alleged war crimes violations during the civil war. During the same month, the Sri Lankan government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sri-lanka-unveils-5-year-action-plan-to-protect-human-rights-in-response-to-international-pressure--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will adopt a National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights. In August, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] accusing Sri Lankan military of having killed civilians during the civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's ruling comes after a lower court  ordered an Internet provider, <a href="http://www.scarlet.be/">Scarlet</a> [official website], to make it impossible for its users to send or receive any file containing musical work. Scarlet appealed, citing that the lower court's decision violated both the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">E-Commerce directive</a> [text, PDF] and fundamental rights. The court agreed with Scarlet's argument:<blockquote>In the present case, the injunction requiring the installation of a filtering system involves monitoring, in the interests of copyright holders, all electronic communications made through the network of the internet service provider concerned. That monitoring, moreover, is not limited in time. Such an injunction would thus result in a serious infringement of Scarlet's freedom to conduct its business as it would require Scarlet to install a complicated, costly, permanent computer system at its own expense. What is more, the effects of the injunction would not be limited to Scarlet, as the filtering system would also be liable to infringe the fundamental rights of its customers, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their right to receive or impart information, which are rights safeguarded by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.</blockquote> The ruling came as a setback to the Belgian management company <a href="http://www.sabam.be/">SABAM</a> [official website], but they responded in a <a href = "http://www.sabam.be/sites/default/files/Engels/Main-menu/PRESS/2011/press_eng_24nov2011_scarlet.pdf">press release</a> [text, PDF] that "[i]f the Court has excluded general filtering, it has not ruled out any other measure.

<p>This is not the first time courts have been asked to rule on issues regarding the Internet, since its use has increased in recent years.

Viasna is a non-governmental human rights organization in Belarus that is dedicated to reporting on allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct as well as providing legal aid and support for political prisoners. The government alleged that Bialiatski had evaded taxation on donations to Viasana by using Polish and Lithuanian accounts to fund his human rights projects, although Viasana is not recognized as a nonprofit organization by the Belarus government, so donations within the country are banned. Prosecutors argued that Bialiatski used the donations as <a href = "http://spring96.org/en/news/47605">personal income</a> [oral arguments summary] that was subject to taxation. In his final statement at trial, Bialiatski criticized the Belarusian government's persecution of Viasna and other human rights organizations:<blockquote>Many of my friends have been dismissed from their jobs and subjected to administrative harassment. The authorities are persecuting their political opponents, restricting civil and political rights and preventing the development of civil society. The authorities do not stand any criticism, harassing journalists and human rights defenders. The key contradiction is in the fact that the authorities' actions are an outrage against the Belarusian Constitution and the country's international obligations. Why did you sign the Declaration? Leave the UN and the OSCE, and everyone will be able to see where we all are.</blockquote>After the announcement of the verdict, protests began in <a href = "http://spring96.org/en/news/47758">Russia</a> and <a href = "http://spring96.org/en/news/47744">Belarus</a> [press releases], both resulting in arrests. The governments of Poland and Lithuania have apologized to Viasna for revealing Bialiatski's account information, and, since the verdict, Lithuania has announced they will have <a href = "http://www.charter97.org/en/news/2011/11/25/45071/">no further diplomatic contact with Belarus</a> [Charter 97 report]. Poland also <a href = "http://www.wbj.pl/article-57038-poland-condemns-jail-sentence-for-belarusian-human-rights-activist.html?typ=wbj">denounced the verdict</a> [<em>Warsaw Business Journal</em> report], calling for Bialiatski 's immediate release. The sentence has also been condemned by the <a href = "http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/nov/24/eu-belarus-activist-convicted/">US embassy in Minsk</a> [AP report], the <a href = "http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website; <a href = "http://www.osce.org/cio/85314">press release</a>], 47 <a href = "http://spring96.org/en/news/47730">Belarusian NGOs</a> [press release], <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website; <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/24/belarus-conviction-rights-defender-blow-rule-law">press release</a>], <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website; <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/belarus-activist-conviction-%E2%80%9Cpolitically-motivated%E2%80%9D-2011-11-24">press release</a>] and the <a href = "http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</A> [official website; <a href = "http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/126272.pdf">press release</a>, PDF].

<p>Belarus has been under increasing criticism for what many see as a rapid decline of human rights in the Eastern European nation. In September, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] suggested a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention in Belarus</a> [JURIST report] and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Her report also cited Belarus as the only European nation to still enforce the death penalty. Ambassador Mikhail Khvostov said his country disagrees with the UN on what constitutes a peaceful demonstration and that Belarus is committed to human rights. The month before, members of the Belarus Parliament introduced a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/belarus-lawmakers-move-to-ban-silent-protests.php">ban so-called "silent protests"</a> [JURIST report], including those involving large groups of people basically doing nothing. Nonetheless, <a href = "http://rt.com/news/belarus-silent-protest-opposition-971/">silent protests continue</a> [RT report], largely in defiance of <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>]. Earlier this year, Belarus' Minsk City Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-delivers-suspended-sentences-to-2-presidential-candidates-for-inciting-riots.php">delivered suspended sentences</a> for two former presidential candidates, Uladzimer Nyaklyaeu and Vital Rymasheuski, convicted of organizing <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">protests following the re-election</a> [JURIST reports] of Lukashenko. The two-year suspended sentences were handed down days after former presidential candidate <a href = "http://www.freebelarusnow.org/en/component/k2/item/43?ml=1">Andrey Sannikau</a> [Free Belarus Now profile] was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-inciting-riots.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/11/un-committee-concerned-about-belarus.php">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [JURIST reports] have similarly denounced Belarus for human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Imed Trabelsi, viewed as the favorite nephew of former first lady Leila Trabelsi, is already in jail for other crimes including <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/tunis-court-sentences-nephew-in-clan-of-ex-president-to-18-years-for-millions-in-bad-checks/2011/11/25/gIQAFZ7SwN_story.html">drug possession, money laundering and embezzlement</a> [AP report], and has been on a hunger strike since November 8 to protest what he says are unfair trials. According to the Tunisian News Agency, Trabelsi's lawyer <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/366-la-une/7567-imed-trabelsi-sentenced-to-18-years-in-prison-and-fined-over-150-thousand-dinars.html">requested the hearing be postponed</a> [TAP report], but the court deemed it unnecessary and decided to pronounce the verdict. Trabelsi has already <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-court-upholds-conviction-of-nephew-of-ex-president-ben-ali.php">appealed his drug convictions and lost</a> [JURIST report], and may still face additional charges. The former businessman was arrested after Ben Ali fled the country to Saudi Arabia in January when the regime toppled under nationwide protests.

<p>Tunisia has been cracking down on the family of Ben Ali since the ousted president fled the country amidst the protests, ending the 23-year autocratic rule in which his family amassed substantial wealth that many Tunisians say was accrued at their expense. In June a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nephew-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-15-years-in-absentia.php">Tunisian court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <em>in absentia</em> Sofiane Ben Ali, another nephew of Ben Ali, to 15 years in prison for issuing bad checks totaling more than USD $430,000. That same week, Ben Ali and his wife were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em></a> and sentenced to 35 years in prison on charges of theft and unlawful possession of money and jewelry just hours after the trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">began that morning</a> [JURIST reports]. The two were also charged with illegal possession of drugs and weapons. Ben Ali said <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report], most of which stem from allegations he authorized the use of force against protesters during the protests, resulting in more than 200 deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Berlusconi had applied for but was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/25/silvio-berlusconi-david-mills-trial">denied an interim injunction</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] preventing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=david+mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive], his former tax lawyer, from appearing via video link from a London court. A justice sitting in private in London turned down the application after giving weight to Italian prosecutors' arguments that Berlusconi was merely trying to delay proceedings. Mills, 64, had set up a web of offshore companies and trusts for Berlusconi, and was indicted with the former prime minister on corruption charges by the Milan district court. He is the estranged husband of former Labour cabinet minister Tessa Jowell, who split with Mills in 2006 after it emerged that, unknown to her, he had paid off part of their mortgage with &#163;350,000 allegedly given as a gift by Berlusconi. Mills was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-court-sentences-former-berlusconi.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] in February 2009. He is now due to testify at Westminster magistrates court on Monday.

<p>Berlusconi has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases, including two other ongoing proceedings involving <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">tax fraud</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> [JURIST reports]. In July an Italian appeals court ordered <a href="http://www.fininvest.it/en/holding/profile">Fininvest</a> [corporate website], a holding company owned by Berlusconi, to pay &#8364;560 million in damages and fees to <a href="http://www.cirgroup.com/">Compagnie Industriali Riunite</a> (CIR) Group [corporate website]. The complaint stemmed from Fininvest's 1991 acquisition of Italian publishing company <a href="http://www.mondadori.com/">Mondadori</a> [corporate website], during which Fininvest bribed a judge in exchange for favorable decisions. Neither Berlusconi nor Ruby <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-trial-for-prostitution-and-abuse-of-power-charges-ajourns-after-10-minutes.php">attended</a> [JURIST report] the beginning of the prostitution trial in April, and the court adjourned after only 10 minutes. Both parties deny having a sexual relationship, and Berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing, calling the accusations groundless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After speaking to North Korean refugees in South Korea, Darusman said he was convinced that <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5if2-ZZdo4aQsgkGovLTIz-n8m6Ig?docId=CNG.85d6efd89b39fb7853a1eb4f76261036.6b1">200,000 political prisoners are being abused</a> [AFP report] in forced labor camps. North Korea has refused to admit agents of the UN to gather information and denies that labor camps exist. Monday's resolution, which urged North Korea "to immediately end all violations of human rights and give voice to the victims of these violations," was lambasted by the North Korean government, which called it an <a href = "http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20111124-312413.html">attempt by the US to tarnish</a> [AFP report] North Korea's reputation with the international community. During the drafting of the resolution, the representative for North Korea also resisted censure, stating the North Korean government was being held to a double standard and they would not respond to confrontation and "political pressure." Darusman, despite his criticisms of the nation, called for other countries, especially South Korea, to <a href = "http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/UN-Investigator-Calls-On-N-Korea-To-Improve-Human-Rights-134485168.html">continue offering aid</a> [VOA report] due to a worsening famine.

<p>In December, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] confirmed that the prosecutor's office has opened preliminary examinations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-examines-possible-war-crimes-charges-against-north-korea.php">evaluate possible war crimes committed by North Korea</a> [JURIST report]. ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] verified that evaluations will determine if some of the incidents by North Korean forces in South Korea constitute war crimes, giving the ICC jurisdiction over the matter. Earlier in 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-committee-condemns-north-korea-rights-violations.php">UN committee condemned</a> [JURIST report] what it called persistent, "grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights" of its own people. In March 2010, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for human rights abuses. Earlier in March, the UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn reported to the UNHRC that North Korean human rights situation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/north-korea-rights-situation-continuing.php">continuing to deteriorate</a> [JURIST report]. This report came after Muntarbhorn's previous criticism, in October, 2009, of North Korea's <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">"abysmal"</a> [JURIST report] and ongoing human rights violations, alleging that the authoritarian government was responsible for various abuses, including torture, public executions, extensive surveillance, media censorship, women's rights violations and widespread hunger.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Claudio Grossman, who currently heads the committee, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11646&LangID=E">said</a> [press release]: "Of particular concern are reports referring to children who have suffered torture and mutilation while detained; as well as cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; arbitrary detention by police forces and the military; and enforced and involuntary disappearances." The committee is composed of 10 members and is tasked with ensuring that countries comply with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text], which Syria ratified in 1988. The requested report, which is due to the committee by March 9, requires Syria to outline the ways in which it is in compliance with the obligations of the Convention as well as provide information on the events that are currently taking place in the country.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] announced that the death toll of Syrian protesters had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-right-office-syria-death-toll-exceeds-3500.php">exceeded 3,500</a> [JURIST report] despite the recent signing of a peace plan sponsored by the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> [official website, in Arabic]. In the week prior to the announcement, approximately 60 people were killed by military and security personnel, included 19 people who were killed during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Spokesperson for the OHCHR, Ravina Samdasani, said, "we are deeply concerned about the situation and by the Government's failure to take heed of international and regional calls for an end to the bloodshed." Additionally, while the Syrian government announced that 553 prisoners would be released, tens of thousands of prisoners remain in detention as dozens of protesters continue to be arrested each day. This announcement followed what have been some of the deadliest clashes of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">movement that began in Syria last March</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/u-civil-rights-commission-hold-2012-briefing-civil-170115692.html">stems from a unanimous vote</a> [press release] taken at the Commission's most recent business meeting. Following the vote, Martin Castro, Commission Chairman, stated, "I believe that the enactment of these state immigration enforcement laws presents a pressing national civil rights issue that affects immigrants and US citizens alike. I'm proud that my fellow Commissioners joined me in voting unanimously and in bipartisan manner to have the Commission look into this important issue." The Commission will start by focusing its efforts on the laws in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina in an attempt to determine whether these laws have resulted in increasing hate crimes or instances of racial profiling, among other civil rights violations. 

<p>Each of the state-enacted immigration laws has faced various legal challenges. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] urging the court to strike down Alabama's <a href="http://latindispatch.com/2011/06/09/text-of-alabama-immigration-law-hb-56/">immigration law</a> [HB 56 text]. The DOJ filed its brief in response to a federal judge's <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66701706/Summary-Opinion-on-Alabama-Immigration-Law">September 28 ruling</a> [opinion text] that allowed the state to enforce a provision that makes it a felony for an illegal alien to conduct business with the state, among other provisions. Also this month, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] not to hear Arizona's appeal of a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/04/11/10-16645_opinion.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] enjoining four provisions of the state's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld an injunction</a> in April before the law ever took effect, and Arizona is now <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asking the high court</a> [JURIST reports] to address whether the state law is preempted by federal immigration legislation. While the state maintains that the Ninth Circuit incorrectly concluded that the state law was facially preempted and "declined to determine whether there were constitutional applications" of the Arizona immigration legislation, the DOJ insists the court <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/11/10/govt_asks_justices_to_stay_out_of_immigration_case/">properly blocked</a> [AP report] the provisions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The activists claim that, in addition to the nearly 470 cases of human rights abuses perpetrated by the government, Mexican <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/mexican-activists-lodge-war-crimes-complaint-against-calderon-at-international-criminal-court/2011/11/25/gIQAUUn3wN_story.html">drug lords have also committed crimes against humanity</a> [AP report] since 2006, including an estimated 40,000 deaths. Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a cartel leader, is also named as a defendant in the complaint. The Mexican Department of the Interior released a statement in response to the complaint, <a href="http://saladeprensa.sre.gob.mx/index.php/es/comunicados/446-372">denying involvement in human rights violations</a> [press release, in Spanish]:<blockquote>The Federal Government strongly rejects that security policy may constitute an international crime. The actions of the National Security Strategy are deployed with full respect for the rule of law, to stop the activity of criminal organizations, to bring their members to justice and prevent the violence and insecurity they generate. If it had not been for the strength shown from the start of the administration, many families in various communities across the country would be at the mercy of criminals.</blockquote>The government also stated that filing a complaint with the ICC was the "wrong way" to "fight crime and impunity," and that the activists should first proceed with their complaint through the national criminal justice system.

<p>This is not the first time the security forces have been accused of committing rights abuses. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/mexico1111webwcover_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] indicating that Mexican security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mexico-security-forces-committing-rights-abuses-hrw.php">committed widespread rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], such as torture and forced disappearances, in combating organized crime. In August, Mexico's <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, in Spanish] issued a <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/fuentes/documentos/Recomendaciones/Generales/019.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] contending that military and law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mexico-human-rights-body-alleges-regular-police-misconduct.php">routinely conducted illegal searches</a> [JURIST report]. Mexico has struggled to combat the drug cartels' influence on the government and the country as a whole. There have been more than <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20101215-mexico-and-cartel-wars-2010?utm_source=SWeekly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=101216&amp;utm_content=readmore&amp;elq=b1b5d866b6a74b31a7b5ad7de5742eaf">27,000 drug-related deaths</a> [STRATFOR report] since 2006.

The activists will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gGdqcSqHQ5LJpKZC-QWLE2Xn8Cxg?docId=248333be974b4e21951077de08f145fb">not be able to appeal the convictions</a> [AP report] and prison sentences because the cases were heard in the country's highest court. The five were charged in June under &#167; 176 of the <a href="http://www.dubailaw.com/article/viewarticle.asp?id=87">UAE Penal Code</a> [text] for publicly insulting UAE president Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed and other government officials. Two of the five men are alleged to have used or incited violence on <a href="http://www.uaehewar.net/Forums/">UAE Hewar</a> [website, in Arabic], an online political forum. Blogger Ahmed Mansoor, one of the five, was also charged with inciting others to break the law, demonstrating and calling for an election boycott. The men have been detained since they were arrested in April after signing an online petition demanding political reforms. Upon learning of the convictions, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on the UAE government to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/uae-end-travesty-justice-five-convicted-over-insults-2011-11-27">release the "prisoners of conscience" immediately</a> [press release], saying the trials failed to meet the minimum standards under international law. 

<p>Rights groups have criticized the UAE recently for its conduct in the wake of calls for political reform. A trial observer appointed by a coalition of human rights groups said earlier this month that the trial of the five activists charged has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/rights-groups-criticize-uae-trial-of-pro-democracy-activists.php">"grossly unfair"</a> [JURIST report] and "has no basis in international law as it violates their freedom of expression." Rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-trial-of-pro-democracy-activists.php">called for the trial to end</a> [JURIST report] in July, but the UAE nonetheless proceeded with the charges. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/22/uae-government-dissolves-rights-group-s-board">urged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-uae-to-reverse-decision-to-dissolve-civil-rights-group.php">report</a>] the government of the UAE in April to reverse its decision to dissolve the board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights group. HRW was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/09/uae-government-detains-human-rights-defender">critical of the UAE government</a> [press release] when it arrested Mansoor in April for calling for democratic reform. HRW also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/uae-foreign-institutions-should-condemn-crackdown">urged international public institutions</a> [HRW press release] that have a presence in the country, such as the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim</a>, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> (NYU), and the <a href="http://www.agencefrancemuseums.fr/en/home/">Agence France Museum</a> [official websites], to publicly condemn the UAE government's detention of rights activists. HRW has continued to monitor the UAE's compliance with international human rights standards following a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/united-arab-emirates">2010 report</a> [HRW report] suggesting the human rights climate in the UAE has worsened. HRW has been particularly concerned about torture, the deterioration of conditions for migrant workers, restrictions on freedoms of expression and association, and violations of women's rights. In October 2010, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/10/19/uae-spousal-abuse-never-right">condemned</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uae-domestic-violence-ruling-a-violation-of-treaty-obligations-hrw.php">report</a>] a ruling by the UAE Federal Supreme Court affirming a "husband['s] right to discipline his wife" as a violation of UAE treaty obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement follows a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] released last week by the <a href="http://www.bici.org.bh/">Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry</a> (BICI) [official website] that Bahrain authorities used excessive force and tortured detainees involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year. The BICI found that the Bahraini government was unprepared to respond to the situation that arose when demonstrations began in the country. Among the numerous recommendations included in the report, the BICI suggested that the nation 
<blockquote>establish a national independent and impartial mechanism to determine the accountability of those in government who have committed unlawful or negligent acts resulting in the deaths, torture and mistreatment of civilians with a view to bringing legal and disciplinary action against such individuals, including those in the chain of command, military and civilian, who are found to be responsible under international standards of&#8212;superior responsibility.</blockquote>
The special commission is set to evaluate the BICI report and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9966728">make its own recommendations</a> [AP report] by February of next year.

<p>Last week, the Bahrain government <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-admits-use-of-excessive-force-against-pro-democracy-protesters.php">admitted the use of excessive force</a> [JURIST report] in the protests. This admission, which was made in anticipation of the independent BICI report, was a reversal of the government's previous <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/world/meast/bahrain-unrest/index.html?eref=rss_world">defense of its actions</a> [CNN report]. In June, Khalifa announced that an independent commission would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-94.htm">Southern Union Co v.

New Jersey</a> [opinion] and its progeny apply to the imposition of criminal fines. <span class="casename">Apprendi</span> requires that "any fact" other than that of a prior conviction "that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=09-2403P.01A">held</a> [opinion] that the <span class="casename">Apprendi</span> rule does not apply to the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-199.htm">Vasquez v. United States</a> [docket], the court will determine whether the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit violated the Supreme Court's precedent on harmless error when it <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=09-4056_002.pdf">focused its harmless error analysis</a> [opinion, PDF] solely on the weight of the untainted evidence without considering the potential effect of the error (the erroneous admission of trial counsel's statements that his client would lose the case and should plead guilty for their truth) on the jury at all. The court will also determine whether the Seventh Circuit violated Vasquez's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by determining that he should have been convicted without considering the effects of the district court's error on the jury that heard the case.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-204.htm">Christopher v. Smithkline Beecham Corp</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/11-204.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine (1) whether deference is owed to the Secretary of Labor's interpretation of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [text, PDF] outside sales exemption and related regulations; and (2) whether the Fair Labor Standards Act's outside sales exemption applies to pharmaceutical sales representatives.

The group issued a <a href="http://partnersworld.org/usa/images/stories/crimes_in_northern_burma/crimes_in_northern_burma.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, graphic content] documenting the war crimes which allegedly began on June 9 after a 17-year ceasefire agreement was broken to begin a war between the Myanmar army and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8528985.stm">Kachin Independence Army</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Evidence for the alleged war crimes was gathered from first-hand interviews of witnesses in Myanmar. The report calls attention to Myanmar's legal obligations and highlights that it has failed to honor its obligations under human rights law and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] and that it may also be subject to charges from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The report calls on the UN to conduct an investigation into the war crimes in Myanmar:<blockquote>Considering the evidence available, the actions and involvement of the Burma Army in causing extensive and prolonged displacement of civilian populations throughout Burma are likely to amount to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. In order to establish the facts, investigate allegations of these grave breaches of international law and hold the perpetrators responsible for their role in such crimes, the international community should support a UN mandated Commission of Inquiry into international crimes in Burma. This does not have to come at the expense of parallel engagement with the Burmese authorities&#8212;on the contrary, the Burmese authorities would be expected to welcome such independent inquiries.</blockquote> The report urges Myanmar to cease the harming of civilians during the war, permit and conduct investigations and allow UN access to conduct an independent investigation. The group also urged US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to raise issues of war crimes when she visits the country as the first Secretary of State to visit Myanmar in 50 years.

<p>Myanmar's human rights record has been at the center of discussion recently. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ban-ki-moon-to-visit-myanmar-praises-ongoing-reforms.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] this month, after meeting with Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thien Sein</a> [BBC backgrounder], that he hopes to visit Myanmar soon and praised the nation for ongoing reforms. Last month, US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that Myanmar's civilian-led government was planning dramatic changes including <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-to-free-hundreds-of-political-prisoners.php">releasing hundreds of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and consequential dialogue with pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. Myanmar has sought to improve its international reputation following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. Myanmar's government formed the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC) in September to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">promote and safeguard the country's constitutional rights</a> [JURIST report]. In August, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana urged the government of Myanmar to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">investigate human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and improve its rights record. In May, Myanmar began <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-releasing-nearly-15000-prisoners-after-un-visit.php">releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to details of Magnitsky's treatment and death, the report alleges corruption by Russian officials in the cover up of the details surrounding Magnitsky's death, and surrounding the apparent theft of $230 million from the Russian Treasury. The report concluded "the Russian government knows exactly who tortured and killed Sergei Magnitsky, as well as who stole $230 million, but has refused to investigate and prosecute them." Magnitsky was arrested on allegations of tax fraud after implicating Russian police in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal while working as outside counsel for the London-based investment fund <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Management</a> [corporate website]. Russian investigators <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/russia-reopens-case-against-dead-lawyer.php">reopened the case</a> [JURIST report] against Magnitsky in August on the basis of a new ruling permitting criminal cases against the dead.

<p>Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] announced in July that Magnitsky's pre-trial death was the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-president-medvedev-admits-jailed-lawyer-was-beaten-to-death.php">result of criminal acts</a> [JURIST report] and not attributable to the denial of medical treatment from prison doctors. Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. Last year, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-lawmakers-seek-to-ban-visas-for-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] from issuing visas to individuals, or their family members, who are connected to Magnitsky's death. In 2009, shortly following Magnitsky's death, a Russian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-human-rights-leader-says-lawyer.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Magnitsky had been murdered while in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investigation on which the report is based on was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-council-adopts-syria-probe-resolution.php">initiated</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] after <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">allegations</a> [JURIST report] of international human rights violations during a crackdown on anti-government protesters since March of this year. The report stressed that due to Syria being a party to most major international treaties such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the state is obligated to respect and promote human rights of all persons. Consequently, the report concluded that the Syrian government and its officials have failed to comply with these responsibilities:<blockquote>The prohibition of crimes against humanity is a jus cogens or peremptory rule, and the punishment of such crimes is obligatory pursuant to the general principles of international law. Furthermore, crimes against humanity are the culmination of violations of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and the prohibition of torture or other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment. According to the principles of State responsibility in international law, the Syrian Arab Republic bears responsibility for these crimes and violations, as well as the duty to ensure that individual perpetrators are punished and that victims receive reparation.</blockquote>The commission urged the Syrian Arab Republic government to take measures in order to end the continuance of human rights violations and to allow immediate and full access to UN human rights monitoring bodies.

<p>The Syrian government has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations since March when the first anti-government protests started. Last week, the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/N11/598/37/PDF/N1159837.pdf?OpenElement">draft resolution</a> [text, PDF] condemning the Syria's human rights violations calling for an immediate end to them. The death toll of Syrian protesters steadily increased since the beginning of the first outbreak of anti-government protests and earlier this month, the number <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-right-office-syria-death-toll-exceeds-3500.php">exceeded 3,500</a> [JURIST report], an increase of 900 from <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-reports-syria-death-toll-at-2600.php">September's number</a> [JURIST report]. The allegations of human rights violations continued to increase as well and last month, Syria was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/syria-urged-to-allow-un-investigation-of-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to allow UN human rights experts to conduct investigations into these allegations. In August, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for the violence against anti-government protests after her <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">demand</a> [JURIST report] to the Syrian government to stop the killings of protesters in March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-708.pdf">First American Financial Corp v. Edwards</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-decide-case-over-title-to-riverbeds-3-others.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a plaintiff has standing to sue, on behalf of a nationwide class, claiming a real estate company violated the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov:80/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/rmra/res/respa_st">Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974</a> [text] without claiming that the violation affected the services rendered. RESPA makes it illegal for settlement service companies to receive a kickback involving any federally related mortgage loan. The plaintiff argues that her title agent improperly referred her to <a href="http://www.firstam.com/">First American Financial</a> [corporate website] in violation of RESPA seeking to recover settlement service charges despite not showing that First American Financial was more expensive or provided inadequate service. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/06/21/08-56536.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the payment of the service charges established an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III standing because RESPA's text does not limit liability to cases where the plaintiff is overcharged. Counsel for the petitioner, First American, argued:<blockquote>Article III requires a private plaintiff to show injury in fact, which means at a minimum that the alleged illegal conduct made her worse off. Factual injury does not automatically follow from violation of a statutory duty owed to the plaintiff, and Ms. Edwards has not alleged the type of harm alleged by plaintiffs in the common law cases that she invokes&#8212;no misappropriation of her property, no loss of desired opportunity or benefit, no injury to reputation.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued:<blockquote>For at least 280 years the law has been clear that when someone breaches a duty of loyalty owed to you by taking a kickback or otherwise introducing a conflict into a transaction, you can sue on the basis of that alone, without showing a further harm in terms of economic loss.</blockquote>Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the respondent.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1195.pdf">Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether Congress divested the federal district courts of their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html">federal question jurisdiction</a> [28 USC &#167; 1331 text] over private actions brought under the <a href="http://www2.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf">Telephone Consumer Protection Act</a> [FCC summary, PDF]. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/201012077.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that federal courts lack jurisdiction over private actions under the act. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The Federal question jurisdiction statute ... broadly grants Federal courts jurisdiction over all actions arising under Federal law unless Congress has provided otherwise. That grant of jurisdiction encompasses rights of action that are created and governed by substantive Federal law. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act sets for forth such a right of action. It provides detailed substantive standards and it grants a private right of action to recover for their violation. The TCPA permits that action to be filed in a State court if the State court allows such action, but it says nothing one way or another about whether the action may also be filed in Federal court.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that "this Court ... should hold that Congress did not intend for private TCPA claims to be brought in Federal court."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling was in response to al-Bashir's <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">second visit</a> [JURIST report], where Kenya joined the ranks of the other African countries that have <a href="http://www.africanews.com/site/Kenya_issues_arrest_warrant_for_alBashir/list_messages/40479">refused to enforce</a> [All Africa report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] arrest warrant. The judge explained that as a signatory of the ICC Rome Statute Kenya is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15932019">obliged to enforce the warrant</a> [BBC report] if given the opportunity. The ICC has issued two international warrants for al-Bashir's arrest on a total of 10 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Under the Rome Statute, ICC member nations that do not comply with cooperation requests can be <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">referred to the UN Security Council</a> [JURIST report] for non-cooperation. In reaction to the court's ruling, the <a href="http://www.kln.gov.my/web/sdn_khartoum/home">Sudanese Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] ordered that the Kenyan ambassador to Sudan be <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201111290462.html">expelled from the country</a> [All Africa report]. The ambassador has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gSPz2H9SBrhDZaI63xX7Z1REaUBw?docId=CNG.51fd675c802c00ccf6a4fb87f46cd12d.61">72 hours to leave Sudan</a> [AP report]. 

<p>Al-Bashir remains an extremely controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the Darfur conflict. The ICC requested last month that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-requests-explanation-from-malawi-for-failure-to-arrest-sudanese-president.php">Republic of Malawi explain</a> [JURIST report] why that country's authorities failed to arrest al-Bashir during his widely reported visit there for a trade summit. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], in a press release on the day of al-Bashir's visit, urged Malawi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-group-urges-malawi-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">arrest the Sudanese president</a> [JURIST report] and surrender him to the ICC for prosecution. In June, AI urged Malaysia to withdraw an invitation for al-Bashir to participate in an event there and to arrest him if he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">travels to the country</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June, ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo issued a statement claiming that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur. In May, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Also Monday, a Bahrain military tribunal resumed the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-court-hears-appeals-of-20-convicted-medics.php">retrial of 20 medical staff members</a> [JURIST report] convicted in September of participating in the country's pro-democracy protests against the ruling regime. The 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics who were jailed for providing treatment to injured protesters all worked at the <a href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website] in Manama, which was stormed by security forces in March after they drove protesters out of the nearby Pearl Square&#8212;the focal point of protests inspired by uprisings that have swept the Arab world. Among other terrorism charges, the 20 were accused of having possession of an AK-47, Molotov cocktails and other weapons for the purposes of ousting the ruling regime, confiscating medical equipment, spreading lies, inciting hatred against the regime and violating various other laws and regulations with an aim to disturb public security. The prosecutor said that the medics' cases will start from scratch and the individuals should not be punished merely for their political views. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j196BRDjQ9BuMtS53E9-0J8cMiJQ?docId=CNG.62960d81c9574355889ec2e3eeb14bb3.4f1">retrials</a> [AFP report], meant to appeal sentences ranging from five to 10 years imprisonment, will be conducted before the highest civilian court in Bahrain, and the 20 will remain out of government custody, pending the outcome of their trials. The ruling on the protesters' death sentences <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/bahrain-postpones-ruling-on-protesters-death-penalty-appeal-as-medics-return-to-court/2011/11/28/gIQA0lRW5N_story.html">has been rescheduled</a> [AP report] for January 9.  

<p>Shortly after the convictions were handed down, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">medics urged the UN to investigate claims of abuse</a> [JURIST report] and due process violations.

The <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/files/billindex/pdf/2011/DR422011E.pdf">Peaceful Assembly Bill</a> [text, PDF] contains an outright ban on street protests while simultaneously restricting the population that may exercise the right to peaceful protest. Under the Act, non-citizens and individuals under 21 years of age are excluded from the "right to organize an assembly or participate in an assembly peaceably and without arms." Those who violate the law may be penalized with thousands of dollars in fines. The ruling party of <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-najib-razak/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] has said the Act is necessary to balance public safety with the right to peaceful assembly. Many have been sharply critical of the law, including opposition leader <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>], who says the law is being improperly rushed through Parliament. Approximately 500 <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2100453,00.html">lawyers protested the law by marching on Parliament</a> [AP report] before the vote in the upper house. Rights groups say they are considering challenging the law in court.

<p>Several other laws have been challenged recently in Malaysian courts. Late last month, the Malaysian <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/?q=en/node/593">Court of Appeal</a> [official website] ruled that a law prohibiting college students from taking part in political activities is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-court-strikes-down-ban-on-student-political-activity.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The suit, filed by four <a href="http://www.iium.edu.my/">International Islamic University of Malaysia</a> [official website] students in 2010, challenged the constitutionality of the 1971 <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%201/Act%2030.pdf">Universities and University Colleges Act</a> (UUCA) [text, PDF] prohibiting students from political participation. Also last month, Malaysia's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-releases-125-prisoners-in-plan-to-repeal-strict-security-law.php">released 125 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who were being held under a decades-old security law that has been widely criticized by human rights and opposition groups. In September, Razak announced that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">repeal two strict security laws</a> [JURIST report] that had allowed extended detention of suspects without trial. The government also said that it will review other laws dealing with freedom of the press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontlibyantc.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] An estimated 7,000 detainees are still being held without due process by Libyan revolutionaries, according to a UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2011/727">report</a> [materials] made public Monday. The report to the UN Security Council, by UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile], says that most of the prisoners are being held in facilities maintained by independent brigades not under the control of the government, and that there have been allegations of abuse of prisoners. The report says that many of the prisoners are sub-Saharan Africans suspected of being mercenaries for former Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muammar+gaddafi">news archive</a>]. Among the alleged abuses of prisoners there have been allegations of torture, targeting individuals based on race, detaining women in facilities with all-male guards, and detaining children in facilities alongside adults. Ban urged immediate action to end the abuse of prisoners:<blockquote>While the National Transitional Council has taken some steps towards transferring responsibility for detainees from brigades to proper State authorities, much remains to be done to regularize detention, prevent abuse, bring about the release of persons whose detention should not be prolonged and ensure that future arrests are carried out only within the law. ... I believe that the leaders of the new Libya are truly committed to building a society based on respect for human rights. However difficult the circumstances, it is essential to take the earliest possible action to end arbitrary detention and prevent abuses and discrimination against third country nationals and against any group of Libya's own citizens.</blockquote>Ban said it is crucial for the UN to continue to work closely with the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] in Libya to monitor the governmental transition and recommended a three-month extension of the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=3543&language=en-US">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> [official website]. Libya's leaders acknowledged Tuesday that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/following-un-report-libyas-new-leaders-acknowledge-prisoners-have-been-abused/2011/11/29/gIQAJK7L8N_story.html">some abuses may have occurred</a> [AP report] but said the problem was not widespread and would be dealt with appropriately.

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-says-libya-can-try-gaddafis-son.php">ICC would allow Libya to conduct the trial of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [JURIST report], son of Muammar Gaddafi. Ocampo said he trusts the new Libyan government will be able to <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_LIBYA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT%22">try him fairly</a> [AP report] despite concern expressed by human rights groups. Ocampo had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-arrives-in-libya-to-discuss-trial-of-gaddafis-son-intelligence-chief.php">traveled to Libya</a> [JURIST report] to discuss the details of the Saif al-Islam trial with Libyan officials. Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/gaddafi-son-captured-by-libya-rebel-forces.php">Saif al-Islam was captured in southern Libya</a>, and Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim al-Keib subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/libya-prime-minister-assures-fair-trial-for-Gaddafi-son.php">pledged that he would receive a fair trial</a> [JURIST reports]. Also this month, <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/show_personnel.php?office=2">Ottilia Maunganidze</a> [profile], a researcher at the <a href="http://www.iss.co.za/default.php">Institute for Security Studies</a> [website], wrote that the NTC must <a href="/hotline/2011/11/ottilia-maunganidze-gaddafi-investigation.php">meet its international obligations</a> [JURIST op-ed] and ensure justice for human rights violations by surrendering Saif al-Islam to the ICC. <a href="http://tupazlaw.com/profile.htm">Edsel Tupaz</a> of Tupaz &#38; Associates and <a href="http://www.countryrisksolutions.com/bio.html">Daniel Wagner</a> [profiles] of Country Risk Solutions wrote this month that while Libya needs a "strategically targeted court system" with a <a href="/sidebar/2011/11/tupaz-wagner-libya-transition.php">specialized war crimes court</a> [JURIST op-ed] at its core, currently there is no avoiding "the fact that there are no domestic judicial mechanisms [in Libya] ... to enforce the voice of the ICC."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hoang was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-court-sentences-blogger-to-3-years-for-subversion.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in August to three years in prison after writing anti-government articles on his blog under his pen name. The appeals court reduced Hoang's sentence from three years to 17 months, but the court upheld his sentence of three years house arrest which he is to serve following the prison term. Hoang was charged with trying to overthrow the government after he reportedly joined the pro-democracy group <a href="http://www.viettan.org/">Viet Tan</a> [political website, in Vietnamese], which is banned in Vietnam as a terrorist organization, and began writing anti-government blog posts. According to Hoang's lawyer, the court cited Hoang's cooperation with police and his commitment to renounce Viet Tan as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-appeals-court-reduces-jail-term-against-french-vietnamese-dissident-by-half/2011/11/29/gIQAwKIN7N_story.html?wprss=rss_europe">reasons for reducing his sentence</a> [AP report].  

<p>In early August, a Vietnamese appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-appeals-court-upholds-7-year-sentence-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">upheld the seven-year sentence</a> of prominent rights lawyer and dissident Cu Huy Ha Vu, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jailed-after-calling-for-government-reform.php">convicted in April</a> [JURIST report] of carrying out anti-state propaganda. The court <a href="http://www.macon.com/2011/08/02/1652056/vietnam-dissident-calls-for-reforms.html">dismissed the appeal</a> [AP report] despite Vu's arguments that his advocating for a multi-party system did not mean he was against the Communist party. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tribunal Vice President <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/about-the-stl/key-characters/judges-of-the-special-tribunal-for-lebanon/vice-president-judge-ralph-riachi">Judge Ralph Riachi</a> [official website] accompanied Baragwanath on the visit, where they saw a spirit of compliance that made them optimistic about their chances for success:<blockquote>I was particularly heartened by the determination of the representatives of the Lebanese people to work for the rule of law and long-term stability. ... I am convinced that the strength of the legal and academic communities of Lebanon will allow the administration of justice in the country to attain new heights. The support we are receiving will allow the STL to contribute to securing the stability that everybody, the killers aside, so earnestly desires, which will open new opportunities for Lebanon.</blockquote>The Tribunal is composed of professional judges selected internationally and includes senior members of the Lebanese judiciary. Baragwanath promised to conclude their job "as swiftly as fairness allows."

<p>The STL has faced <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/prosecutors-urge-lebanon-tribunal-not-to-initiate-trial-in-absentia.php">great difficulty</a> [JURIST report] trying to arrest the members of Hezbollah in Lebanon where the Shiite militia Hezbollah, backed by Iran, is the country's most powerful political force. Hezbollah has denied involvement in the suicide bombing on February 14, 2005, which killed former Lebanese prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">news archive</a>] in addition to 22 other people. If the trial commences, this would be the first trial <em>in absentia</em> at an international court since the prosecution of Nazis during the Nuremberg trials. In 2007, the UN Security Council approved a resolution to establish an ad hoc international tribunal to investigate and try suspects in the assassination of Hariri.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Monday blocked a proposed $285 million settlement with <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup Inc</a> [corporate website] over the sale of toxic mortgage debt. The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] put no effort into learning what Citigroup did wrong, Judge Jed Rakoff wrote, adding that the SEC was wrong to ask the court to ignore interests of the public:<blockquote>It is not fair, because, despite Citigroup's nominal consent, the potential for abuse in imposing penalties on the basis of facts that are neither proven nor acknowledged patent. It is not adequate, because, in the absence of any facts, the Court lacks a framework for determining adequacy. And, most obviously, the proposed Consent Judgment does not serve the public interest, because it asks the Court to employ its power and assert its authority when it does not know the facts. An application of judicial power that does not rest on facts is worse than mindless, it is inherently dangerous. The injunctive power of the judiciary is not a free roving remedy to be invoked at the whim of a regulatory agency, even with the consent of the regulated. If its deployment does not rest on facts&#8212;cold, hard, solid facts, established either by admissions or by trials&#8212;it serves no lawful or moral purpose and is simply an engine of opposition.</blockquote>A trial date is set for July 16, 2012.

<p>In October, the judge <a href="online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/CitiRakoff.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] the SEC and Citigroup to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-asks-sec-citigroup-to-defend-settlement.php">defend their recent settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report]. The agreement concluded the dispute that charged Citigroup with having misled its investors about a $1 billion loan that defaulted. The result left investors to bear the burden while Citigroup reaped $160 million in profits from trading and fees. Rakoff directed both parties to answer nine questions pertaining to the $285 million settlement. One of Rakoff's principal issues is why the SEC imposed a $95 million penalty on Citigroup but imposed a $535 million <a href="www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/judgment-pr2010-123.pdf">penalty</a> [settlement agreement, PDF] on Goldman Sachs in a July 2010 suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge declared that the "Choose Life" license plates were an expression of private speech rather than government speech which would have allowed the North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/">General Assembly</a> [official website] to regulate the message. The judge's ruling was a response to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-north-carolina-pro-life-license-plates.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by ACLU-NCLF claiming that the legislature's authorization of the June <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/billlookup/billlookup.pl?Session=2011&BillID=H289">bill</a> [HB 289 materials] violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] guarantee of free speech by supporting a pro-life message while refusing to approve an additional license plate reading 'Respect Choice' which would indicate advocacy of reproductive rights. Katy Parker, the political director for the ACLU-NCLF, praised the court's decision:<blockquote>This case is ultimately about free speech and equal treatment for all North Carolinians, regardless of their point of view on abortion. The state should not be allowed to use its authority to promote one side of a debate while denying the same opportunity to the other side. We look forward to continuing our arguments in this case, and hope the court agrees that the First Amendment prohibits the blatant type of viewpoint discrimination the state has proposed through this one-sided license plate scheme.</blockquote>A federal court struck down similar pro-life license plate messages in South Carolina, ordering the state to pay <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] for legal fees. 

<p>Abortion continues to be an extremely controversial issue in North Carolina. In October, a federal district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a provision of a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">state abortion law</a> [HB 854 materials] that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. This law, known as the "Woman's Right to Know Act" also requires a 24-hour waiting period for women seeking an abortion. In June, North Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed the bill</a> [JURIST report], calling it "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." In July, however, both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] voted to override the veto, allowing the legislation to become North Carolina law. Opponents of the law have called it "draconian" and have stated that women seeking abortions will face dramatic changes once the law takes effect, while supporters contend that the new law will give women the opportunity to "know all the facts" about abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill explicitly states that marriages entered into by persons of the same gender are prohibited and will not be recognized as valid, even if the marriage certificate is obtained in a foreign country. Individuals who enter into a same-sex marriage are liable for three years imprisonment each, and any person or group who aids a same-sex marriage contract is liable for a term of imprisonment of five years, a fine or both. International opposition to the bill was recognized by lawmakers, but <a href="http://www.nassnig.org/nass/index.php">Senate President David Mark</a> [official website] said that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hK4ab_LFMsSJop6fKtww2m1aFFlA?docId=8846b86be67347d597cef8f02f1fac7f">Nigeria would not bow to international pressure</a> [AP Report] on any legislation.

<p>Most African nations, excluding South Africa, have criminalized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive], and Nigeria in particular has long discriminated against gays and lesbians. Earlier this month, Australian <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/your-pm">Prime Minister Julia Gillard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/australia-pm-proposes-vote-on-same-sex-marriage.php">proposed a vote on same-sex marriage</a>, and Brazil granted its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/brazil-grants-first-citizenship-based-on-same-sex-marriage.php">first citizenship based on same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, Chilean <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidente/">President Sebastian Pinera</a> [official profile, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/chile-president-introduces-civil-union-legislation.php">proposed legislation that would legalize same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed its <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">first gay rights resolution</a> [JURIST report]. Despite these advances, other countries have stood strongly against same-sex marriage. In April, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">Hungary added a prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its constitution, and in January, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">France upheld a same-sex marriage ban</a> [JURIST report]. As of a 2011 <a href="http://ilga.org/">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] <a href="http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Consequently, the only way the prosecutor can begin such an investigation is if the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] instructs him to do so. While the Security Council has yet to make such an order, it has issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10460.doc.htm">statement on Yemen</a> [press release] reiterating that "all those responsible for violence, human rights violations and abuses should be held accountable." Saleh stepped down as Yemen's president last week in a deal that would grant immunity to the country's former leader, prompting Karman to add that stronger mechanisms are needed to account for leaders who turn on their own people to remain in power.

<p>Karman, a Yemeni journalist and activist, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/nobel-peace-prize-awarded-to-womens-rights-activists.php">won her Nobel Peace Prize</a> [JURIST report] for aiding the protest movement in Yemen that forced Saleh from the presidency. While Karman will have to wait for further action by the UN, the Security Council in September <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-security-council-urges-end-to-yemen-violence.php">called on Yemen to comply with international law</a> [JURIST report] and end ongoing violence against protesters that resulted in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119254238529145.html">deaths of at least 49 people</a> [Al Jazeera report] shortly following Saleh's return as president after a three-month absence. Also in September, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-calls-for-immediate-intervention-in-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.php">urged an intervention</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen after verifying that the Yemeni government was indeed firing on peaceful protesters.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-875.pdf">Hall v. US</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-upholds-gender-discrimination-ruling-takes-4-more-cases.php">report</a>], the justices heard arguments on a conflict between tax law and bankruptcy procedures, regarding the sale of family farms under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_11_10_12.html">Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code</a> [text]. The Hall family, after filing bankruptcy for their farm, found a purchaser who paid more than the value of their debt. As a result, they incurred a significant capital gains tax of $29,000, which would typically go to the IRS, but a <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1222&url=/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_00001222----000-.html">recent provision</a> [11 USC &#167;&#167; 1222(a)(2)(A)] to Chapter 12 deems government interests as an unsecured creditor on the Chapter 12 estate, to be wiped away in the bankruptcy. The Halls' attorney argued for this reading of the new provision, as well as referring to the legislative history of the law, which was intended to aid farmers going through bankruptcy by protecting them from the capital gains tax. The Solicitor General argued that the tax was a post-bankruptcy gain and thus not affected by the Chapter 12 statute, as well as being a debt created by the <em>debtor</em>, rather than the estate in bankruptcy. Justice Elena Kagan commented on the dichotomy between Congess' intent to help farmers and the IRS proposed theory of what the law means: "But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale; and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12. So it's a little bit odd&#8212;it's actually more than a little bit odd. It's a lot odd to read the statutes to apply not in that context, but only as to people who have somehow managed to sell their property, you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1261.pdf">Credit Suisse Securities LLC v. Simmonds</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the justices considered when the statute of limitations for reporting insider trading begins. The <a href = "http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec16.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [&#167; 16(b)] states that the statute of limitations begins "more than two years after the date such [profits from insider trading] was realized." Attorney for Vanessa Simmonds, who filed 54 complaints against Credit Suisse, which were rejected on varying grounds including statute of limitations, argued that the statute of limitations can be tolled to include the discovery of the trading or even the filing of a report about the illegal action. This view was endorsed by the Ninth Circuit's <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7324004540755589567&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">ruling</a> [text] that led to the Supreme Court. Petitioners argued for a strict interpretation of the law where the statute of limitations runs firmly from the date of the alleged misconduct. The Solicitor General interceded to argue a third option, that it tolls when a reasonable person should have known about the incident. Chief Justice John Roberts did not participate in the hearing of this case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Robert Wiggins refused to dismiss the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-new-york-same-sex-marriage-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed in July by <a href="http://www.nycf.info/">New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms</a> [advocacy website, <a href="http://www.nycf.info/component/content/article/37-home/495-court-rules-in-new-yorkers-for-constitutional-freedoms-favor?format=pdf">press release</a>, PDF] on the theory that there is a justiciable issue as to whether <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] committed a procedural violation in passing New York's <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/assets/marriageequalitybill.pdf">Marriage Equality Act</a> [text, PDF] earlier this year. By invoking a rule in which the governor may certify facts necessitating an immediate vote on the bill, Cuomo circumvented the state constitution's requirement that any bill be printed and on the desks of legislators for three days before any vote. The <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/">State Attorney General's Office</a> [official website] filed briefs in an effort to dismiss the suit, but the judge held there were not sufficient facts before the court to determine the legitimacy of the plaintiffs' allegation that Cuomo's private meeting with Republican members of the Senate, in which he urged them to "break the party's position and vote for the bill" prior to its passage, constituted a violation of the state's <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/coog/openmeetlaw.html">Open Meetings Law</a> [text]. Wiggins also criticized Cuomo for certifying in the first place that the bill needed to be voted on immediately, calling the cite by the governor "disingenuous" but noting that the court "is reluctantly obliged to rule that the message of necessity submitted by the Governor was accepted by vote of the Senate, and is NOT within this Court's province to nullify." To avoid the 72-hour rule, Cuomo cited the need to immediately remedy the denial of more than 50,000 same-sex couples the "critical protections of different-sex couples, including hospital visitation, inheritance and pension benefits." In his decision, Wiggins emphasized that the court was not expressing any opinion on same-sex marriage, but was only considering issues concerning the procedures the New York Legislature followed when passing the Marriage Equality Act.

<p>Cuomo <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">signed legislation allowing same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST report] in the state on June 24. The <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/">New York State Senate</a> [official website] had passed the Marriage Equality Act 33-29 earlier that same day following weeks of negotiations. The act eliminates any legal distinctions between opposite-sex and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marriage">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] and specifies that no clergy member will be forced to perform a marriage ceremony and that any refusing clergy member will not be subject to legal action. The New York State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-assembly-again-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill,-stalls-in-senate.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month 80-63, and the law went into effect on July 25. Shortly after the bill's passage <a href="http://www.marriagelawfoundation.org/board.html">William Duncan</a>, Director of the Marriage Law Foundation argued that the legislation <a href="/hotline/2011/06/william-duncan-new-york-marriage.php">sets a bad precedent and is possibly unconstitutional</a> [JURIST comment] due to the very violations of procedural requirements that have allowed the challenge to proceed. The New York State Assembly had passed same-sex marriage bills before in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/new-york-assembly-passes-spitzer-gay.php">2007</a> and in <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-york-state-assembly-approves-same.php">2009</a>, but the bills were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">unable to pass the Senate</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The indictment <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/chilean-judge-seeks-extradition-of-former-us-military-officer-in-2-killings-under-pinochet/2011/11/29/gIQA7d9v8N_story.html">charges</a> [CNN report] Davis with the homicides of journalist Charles Horman and US university student Frank Teruggi. Both crimes were alleged to have been committed during the 1973-1990 regime of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/472707.stm">General Augusto Pinochet</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">news archive</a>]. Davis served as a commander of a US military mission in Chile in 1973 when a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/11/newsid_3199000/3199155.stm">coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] ensued that resulted in the ousting of former socialist president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3089846.stm">Salvador Allende</a> [BBC profile] and the seizure of power by Pinochet. It is alleged that Horman and Teruggi, who were being monitored by US agents as part of a secret investigation into the actions of Americans in Chile, were executed after being arrested during the coup. Davis is accused of having had the power to stop the executions, but failing to do so. His whereabouts are currently unknown, and he has previously denied any involvement in the killings. Retired Chilean army Brigadier Pedro Espinoza Bravo has also been charged in the murders. 

<p>Last January, a Chilean <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.cl/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/chile-orders-probe-into-death-of-salvador-allende.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of Allende during the 1973 coup. Since the coup, Allende's death has been ruled a suicide. Allende, a Marxist, was met with opposition after winning the 1970 elections in Chile from those fearing his presidency would support a pro-Soviet communist government. The 1973 coup, <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/declassified-transcript-hints-at-us.htm">backed by the US</a> [JURIST report], was followed by a 17-year military regime led by Pinochet. The investigation into Allende's death is part of a larger probe into the military dictatorship of Pinochet. Prosecutor Beatriz Padrals will investigate 726 cases of alleged human rights abuses allegedly committed during the Pinochet regime. Hundreds of Chilean officials are also under investigation for human rights abuses committed under Pinochet, including the so-called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/850932.stm">"Caravan of Death"</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=caravan+of+death">news archive</a>] following the coup, the death or disappearance of more than 3,000 people and 28,000 cases of alleged torture. Pinochet <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/pinochet-dead-at-91-without-ever.php">died</a> [JURIST report] before ever facing trial for any of the crimes that were committed during his dictatorship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Mikati, Lebanon <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hVuKbkE3GEPfc9iyd15U4LAa5OsA?docId=b56148d92d6b468a9ec4bed79451b9c3">transferred the $36 million</a> [AP report] it was required to contribute in an effort to demonstrate the country's commitment to "international obligations and the principles of justice." The tribunal has been attempting to investigate and hold accountable those involved in the killing of former Lebanese prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">news archive</a>], who died as the result of a suicide bomb which also killed 22 others. This investigation has been controversial in Lebanon, especially with regards to the question of the appropriate level of involvement and cooperation that is warranted from Lebanese officials. Since the initiation of the investigation, the court has indicted four members of the Hezbollah group, which maintains that it was not involved in the bombing.

<p>On Monday, the president of the tribunal, <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/about-the-stl/key-characters/judges-of-the-special-tribunal-for-lebanon/president-judge-sir-david-baragwanath">Judge David Baragwanath</a> [official website], issued a statement <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/lebanon-tribunal-leader-defends-institution.php">defending his program</a> [JURIST report] following a visit to Lebanon. Tribunal Vice President <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/about-the-stl/key-characters/judges-of-the-special-tribunal-for-lebanon/vice-president-judge-ralph-riachi">Judge Ralph Riachi</a> [official website] accompanied Baragwanath on the visit, where they saw a spirit of compliance that made them optimistic about their chances for success. The Tribunal is composed of professional judges selected internationally and includes senior members of the Lebanese judiciary. Baragwanath promised to conclude their job "as swiftly as fairness allows." The STL has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/prosecutors-urge-lebanon-tribunal-not-to-initiate-trial-in-absentia.php">faced great difficulty</a> [JURIST report] trying to arrest the members of Hezbollah in Lebanon where the Shiite militia Hezbollah, backed by Iran, is the country's most powerful political force. If the trial commences, this would be the first trial <em>in absentia</em> at an international court since the prosecution of Nazis during the Nuremberg trials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill <a href = &#8220;http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/hansard/2011/2011_11_29_DAILY.pdf&#8221;>passed</a> [transcript, PDF] with 47 MPs voting in favor and 40 voting against it. Speaking in support of the bill on the floor of Parliament, Queensland <a href="http://www.thepremier.qld.gov.au/">Premier Anna Bligh</a> [official website] declared:<blockquote>Tonight, the bill that is before the parliament seeks to strike a blow against prejudice and to strike a blow against discrimination. [&#8230;] [T]hat is what this bill is about: dignity and respect for relationships that are precious in their own right. The arguments we hear from the opposition simply do not hold any weight. The first argument is that somehow this issue is not a priority&#8212;that is, that governments should only ever do things that are on the top of the list, that you should never do things that might be important to the minority, that governments should never concern themselves with issues that matter to some people but not everybody. I would argue that the fight against discrimination should be a priority of any government. I make the point that it may not be a priority for every member on the other side and it may not be a priority for every Queenslander, but it is a priority for those people who live with discrimination every single day of their lives.</blockquote><a href="http://www.qgd.qld.gov.au/loc-minister.html">Health Minister Geoff Wilson</a> [official website] expressed his opposition to the legislation on religious grounds, saying that although he supports same-sex rights, his faith prevents him from endorsing civil unions: "I do not believe we should institutionalise and formalise a new type of relationship
outside of marriage for couples, whether they are of the same sex or opposite sex." Two weeks ago, Australian <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/your-pm">Prime Minister Julia Gillard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/australia-pm-proposes-vote-on-same-sex-marriage.php">called on Australia's Parliament</a> [JURIST report] to vote on whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Parliament has yet to take up the issue.

<p>Australia historically has had a tumultuous past regarding the legal rights of same-sex couples. In May 2008, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dnp-australia-capital-abandons-plan-to.php">abandoned a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to legally recognize same-sex civil union ceremonies after the Australian federal government threatened to veto <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/b/db_27837/default.asp">Civil Partnerships Bill 2006</a> [legislative materials] if it passed the <a href="http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/">Legislative Assembly</a> [official website]. ACT Attorney General Simon Corbell said that the self-governing territory will now move to legalize civil partnerships without ceremony so that same-sex couples can have access to Commonwealth pensions, tax and social security benefits. The Civil Partnerships Bill was introduced after an <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2006-22/default.asp">earlier civil unions law</a> [legislative materials] was actually <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-federal-government-nixes.php">overturned by the federal government</a> [JURIST report] because that law's attempt to equate civil unions with marriage was determined to be unacceptable. In April of 2008, the Australian government introduced legislation to <a href="/2008/04/australia-to-amend-laws-to-end-same-sex.php">amend over 100 federal laws</a> [JURIST report] to remove discrimination against same-sex couples but continued to bar same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was surrendered to the ICC by the national authorities of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13287216">Ivory Coast</a> [BBC backgrounder] on Tuesday and brought to the Netherlands in response to a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">warrant of arrest</a> [text, PDF] that was issued by the judges last week. The warrant charged Gbagbo with four counts of crimes, including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during last year's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive]. The prosecution believes that Gbagbo is responsible for the crimes as an indirect co-perpetrator, alleging that the violence by pro-Gbagbo forces was committed through an "organisational policy" under his command. Gbagbo is the first of the several suspects related to the post-election violence who was taken into custody by the court. Gbagbo's initial appearance is scheduled for December 5.

<p>When the Gbagbo refused to step down from his position as a president after his defeat in the November election by the current president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] violence resulted due to the arising fight between the two forces. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">forced out and captured</a> [JURIST report] in April. Last month, the ICC's <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-singles-out-individuals-for-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that the court will focus their investigations specifically on three to six suspects most responsible in the alleged involvement in the post-election violence after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">arrived</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast. The investigation was set in motion after the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-to-open-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution's request to look into the crimes committed during the post-election period. In the same month, the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hrw-releases-ivory-coast-post-election-war-crimes-reports.php">report</a> [JURIST report] related to the said incident and urged the Ivory Coast government to prosecute both sides of the post-election violence equally. Ivory Coast <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ivory-coast-initiates-post-election-violence-reconciliation-commission.php">initiated a Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> [JURIST report] last month in order to resolve the conflicts arising out of the post-election violence in response to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">UN's call for investigation</a> [JURIST report] in June and to HRW's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">request </a> [JURIST report] for the same.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The FTC filed a complaint against Facebook alleging that privacy settings on the site <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0923184/111129facebookcmpt.pdf">failed to apply to third party  sites and applications</a> [complaint, PDF]. Under the settlement agreement Facebook must <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm">make users fully aware</a> [press release] of all changes in privacy settings that would override their previously consented to settings. Additionally, Facebook will be subject to third party audits every two years for the next 20 years. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, released a <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150378701937131">statement</a> [blog post] admitting that Facebook had made mistakes, but promised to do better in the future. <blockquote> Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us - and we have led the internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share. But we can also always do better. I'm committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy. </blockquote>Now that the FTC has proposed the settlement, the public has 30 days to comment on it. After that, the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed settlement final. 

<p>In September, members of the <a href="http://markey.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=934&Itemid=15">Congressional Privacy Caucus</a> [official website] asked the FTC to look into Facebook's privacy settings, including allegations that Facebook continued to track user's activities after they <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-lawmakers-ask-ftc-to-investigate-facebook-over-privacy-concerns.php">logged out</a> [JURIST report] of the website. This is also not the first time Facebook has been the target of governmental review. In August, the <a href="http://www.datenschutz-hamburg.de/">Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information </a>[official website, in German] accused Facebook of <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/germany-authorities-says-facebook-facial-recognition-violates-european-data-protection-law.php">violating European data protection laws</a> [JURIST report] through its facial recognition feature that automatically recognizes and "tags" users when others upload photos of them. In December 2010, South Korea alleged that Facebook <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/south-korea-says-facebook-not-complying-with-data-privacy-laws.php">failed to comply</a> [JURIST report] with privacy laws and expressed concern over the handling of personal information and data. The <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/">Canadian Office of the Privacy Commissioner</a> [official website] announced in January 2010 that it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-privacy-commissioner-launches.php">launching a probe</a> [JURIST report] into Facebook's privacy setting as a result of the new feature that allowed people to alter it, but left the default setting very much public. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment, authored by <a href="http://markudall.senate.gov/">Senator Mark Udall</a> and proposed by <a href="http://paul.senate.gov/">Senator Rand Paul</a> [official websites], suggested to institute a timeline to allow further study and investigation on the issue of counterterrorism by Congress. The amendment was rejected by a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00211">67-30 vote</a> [roll call, text], allowing the controversial provision to remain in the act. The provision grants the military complete custody and control over terror suspects and grants authority to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] over whether suspects should be tried in military or civilian courts. Opponents of the provision fear it could be applied to US citizens threatening their constitutional liberties. Supporters argue that the idea of an American citizen suspected of aiding <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">news archive</a>] not getting due process is simply a lie. The entire bill is now under consideration by the Senate. If passed, it will be sent to the White House, which previously released a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] warning that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] could <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/obama-threatens-veto-of-defense-spending-bill-over-detainee-provision.php">veto the bill</a> [JURIST report] if it "challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, [or] protect the Nation." The White House protested that the FBI should have unrestricted access and interrogation rights over domestically detained al Qaeda suspects, rather than the military.

<p>The provision was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] in a unanimous vote after disagreements regarding the provision had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked their passage for months</a> [CNN report]. The passage by the SASC came shortly after an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [PDF] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. The report posits that certain US policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to close the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news archive], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-7387.pdf">Setser v. US</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-upholds-gender-discrimination-ruling-takes-4-more-cases.php">report</a>], the justices heard arguments on a federal district court's power to determine whether a federal sentence will be served consecutively or concurrently to an as-yet undischarged state sentence. The petitioner argued that under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00003584----000-.html">&#167; 3584</a> [text] of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) and in the absence of an existing state sentence, the federal judge lacked authority to stipulate that the federal sentence to be served consecutively.:<blockquote>[A]t the time that the Federal judge passed this sentence, he had no idea what was going to happen in either [State] case. But more importantly, with regard to the term of probation, the Federal judge had no idea whether that term was going to be revoked, whether it would be modified, or whether he would receive any sentence of&#8212;of imprisonment at all. And in making the judgment on whether those terms should run concurrently or consecutively, Your Honor, 3584(b) directs the Court to look at the factors of 3553(a) in making that determination. And it would be impossible to make that determination under 3553(a) whether the sentence is adequate to deter, whether that sentence protects the public, without knowing what that State term of imprisonment actually is.</blockquote>Interestingly, the government had conceded the issue and argued on behalf of petitioner that the federal judge exceeded his authority by making the consecutive/concurrent decision in the absence of a state sentence. Rather, that decision would lie with the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) which would consider several factors including a recommendation from the sentencing judge. Appointed counsel arguing in support of the Fifth Circuit opinion urged that &#167; 3584, which instructs when sentences ought or ought not be consecutive or concurrent, did not address the current situation. Therefore, the federal judiciary retained its inherent power to sentence, including discretion to make the sentence run concurrently or not. The respondent asserted, "Neither section 3584 nor any other provision of the Sentencing Reform Act even remotely approaches the clarity that Congress would use if it intended to restrict judicial sentencing in cases like Setser's."  Respondent queried whether the question of consecutive-concurrent sentencing was best handled by the judge or jailor, urging that Congress did not intend to take that sentencing power away from judges in favor of BOP bureaucrats.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1024.pdf">Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-decide-case-over-title-to-riverbeds-3-others.php">report</a>], the justices heard arguments on whether a pilot who was convicted and fined for failing to disclose to the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) that he had HIV, a fact which was illegally revealed by the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> (SSA) [official websites] where Cooper sought disability based on his HIV status, can sue the federal government for mental and emotional damages for violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552---a000-.html">Privacy Act of 1974</a> [5 USC &#167; 552a]. The government argued that Congress, by specifically excluding general damages, did not provide for damages for mental and emotional distress or, at least, did not clearly waive sovereign immunity. Asserting the dichotomy of special (or economic) damages versus general damages, inclusive of damages for mental and emotional distress, the government insisted that only damages of pecuniary nature could be recovered from the government under the Privacy Act. The respondent pilot characterized the government's argument as unnecessarily introducing ambiguity into the statute which would undermine the purpose of the Act. The respondent emphasized the text of the Act:<blockquote>What was authorized in the text, the substantive provision, is actual damages, not special damages. If Congress had wanted to peel off the whole piece and require only economic loss, the more common and routine term of art that is used is special damages. ... In the context of this act, ... Congress does not choose special damages as the term of what it's authorizing, and instead chooses the broader term, "actual damages."</blockquote>Respondent insisted that the plain meaning of actual damages is proved damages, as opposed to presumed damages. Respondent also urged that under the government's construction of the statute, intentional and willful violations of the act, like, for example, a whistleblower the government wants to silence by leaking embarrassing details to the press as opposed to outright firing, would have no remedy because they are not out of pocket any money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In early November, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-tobacco-label-requirements.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the implementation of graphic image and textual warning labels imposed by the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text]. The FDA has mandated that by September 2012, all cigarette packaging shall contain new <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/CigaretteWarningLabels/default.htm">warning labels</a> [FDA backgrounder] with graphic images of the health issues related to smoking and related textual warnings. The major cigarette manufacturers requested the injunction on the basis that the new regulations violate their First Amendment rights and burden their right to commercial speech by compelling placement of the new warning labels on the top 50 and bottom 20 percent of all packaging and advertisements. The FDA is now planning to appeal that injunction to the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website]. 

<p>New tobacco warning labels have also drawn scrutiny in Australia, where Philip Morris has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] to block <a href="http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-label-images">new graphic warning label requirements</a> [AUS Health Dept. backgrounder] recently enacted in that country. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the FSPTCA into law</a> [JURIST report], granting the FDA certain authority to regulate manufactured tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. Cigarettes and other tobacco products have been subject to strict marketing regulations on both the federal and state levels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko was convicted of corruption and abuse of authority while <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hc2N8rYTQ2WwTsYkM-GY39UrhGPQ?docId=bd2ce6c95ceb4ed9982b39e0f184e716">negotiating a gas contract with Russia</a> [AP report] in 2009, and has been barred from serving public office for three years.

Tymoshenko's political rival, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4038803.stm">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [BBC backgrounder] maintains that the charges and convictions are not political and that were he to intercede in the process to absolve Tymoshenko, it would become politicized. The European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">criticized the handling of Tymoshenko's case</a> [JURIST report] in October, calling it a violation of human rights.

<p>Tymoshenko's prosecution has been <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">highly controversial</a> [JURIST comment] and has drawn harsh criticism internationally. In November the Ukrainian Parliament <a href="http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=290035&cat_id=105995">voted against</a> [agenda text] hearing amendments that would have <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ukraine-parliament-rejects-hearing-bill-designed-to-free-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">effectively freed</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko by fining her rather than imposing a criminal sentence for the financial crimes of which she was convicted. The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] her conviction as politically motivated and has indicated that it could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Yanukovych. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports].

Jane O'Toole is leading the ICC investigation into allegations that <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110609-libya-gaddafi-linked-systematic-rape-opposition-says-icc-prosecutor-ocampo">Gaddafi ordered mass rapes</a> [Reuters report] and provided troops with sexual stimulants for the purpose of enforcing an official rape policy. According to Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], the ICC has evidence that <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/110608/muammar-gaddafi-libya-international-criminal-court-rape-viagra">rape was used to punish women, instill fear and subdue the population</a> [<em>Global Post</em> report]. Ocampo stated his investigation is nearly finished, and the results of this investigation may be used to file additional charges against Libya's chief of intelligence, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [warrants], among others. It has been alleged that al-Senussi was involved in the ordering and organizing of mass rapes. 

<p>Ocampo revealed the possibility of <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-may-press-additional-charges-against-libya-intelligence-chief-others.php">new sex-related charges</a> [JURIST report] in November. Also last month, Ocampo said that the ICC would allow Libya to conduct the trial of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, Muammar Gaddafi's son. Ocampo had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-arrives-in-libya-to-discuss-trial-of-gaddafis-son-intelligence-chief.php">traveled to Libya</a> [JURIST report] to discuss details of Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi's trials with Libyan officials and decide where they should be held. Saif al-Islam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/gaddafi-son-captured-by-libya-rebel-forces.php">captured</a> by Libyan opposition forces last month after arrest <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">warrants were issued</a> [JURIST reports] by the ICC for him, his father and al-Senussi in June.

Ben Ali and eight others were <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFL5E7MU37P20111130">found guilty</a> [Reuters report] of the torture of 17 military generals in connection with a 1991 coup attempt. Ben Ali was sentenced to five years in prison. This week's sentence adds to a 35-year prison sentence handed down in June after his conviction <em>in absentia</em> on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">theft and illegal possession</a> [JURIST report] of money, jewelry, drugs and weapons. Ben Ali, who remains in exile in Saudi Arabia, has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him. His most recent conviction resulted from the first trial held against a former Tunisian government official since the new democratically-elected government took power earlier this year. 

<p>Tunisia has been cracking down Ben Ali and his relatives since the ousted president fled the country amidst the protests that ended his 23-year autocratic rule. Ben Ali has claimed that he was <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&section=middleeast&col=">"duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer, and that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. In February, the Tunisian <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gov.tn/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] submitted a formal request to Saudi Arabian authorities to extradite Ben Ali following the filing of additional charges of money laundering and possession of unlicensed weapons. The Tunisian Constitutional Council officially announced that Ben Ali had permanently left the office of the presidency in January, after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] during the nationwide protests that resulted in more than 200 deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two weeks ago, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/">Parliament</a> [official website] enacted the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011B00128">Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill</a> [text], which removes descriptive colors and logos from cigarette boxes and requires a depiction of the negative effects of smoking. The law will take effect December 1, 2012. BAT argued that the new law would flood the black market with fake cigarettes and that the taxpayers would lose out on billions of dollars as a result of lost excise taxes. Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for BAT, said that the company will fight the government to preserve its rights:<blockquote>Obviously we'd rather not be in a situation where we're forced to take the Government to court but unfortunately for taxpayers the Government has taken us down the legal path. [The government] will now waste millions of taxpayer's dollars on legal fees defending plain packaging even though ... there is no proof it will reduce smoking rates. As a legal company selling a legal product we have consistently said we will defend our valuable intellectual property on behalf of our shareholders as any other company would.</blockquote>Health Minister <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/Profile-NR-1">Nicola Roxon</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/0C72194D683CCADBCA257959000C404A/$File/NR255.pdf">defended the law</a> [press release, PDF] and said that tobacco companies will have 12 months to comply with the new requirements.

<p>This is not the first suit brought in Australia as a result of the new law. In late November, <a href="http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_hk.aspx">Philip Morris Asia Ltd.</a> (PMA) [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">initiated legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of its Australian subsidiary <a href="http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_au.aspx">Philip Morris Ltd.</a> [corporate website]. While Australia is the first country to enact such stringent laws, tobacco packaging is an issue in the US as well. In early November a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] granted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-tobacco-label-requirements.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to block the implementation of new requirements imposed by the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text]. Additionally, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/tobacco-companies-challenge-cigarette-labeling-regulations.php">four tobacco companies</a> [JURIST report] sued the US government in August claiming that new cigarette labeling regulations violated their First Amendment rights. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the FSPTCA into law</a> [JURIST report], granting the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation increased warning label requirements, prohibited marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allowed for the regulation of cigarette ingredients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Liechtenstein's UN Ambassador Christian Wenaweser, current president of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) to the Rome Statute that set up the ICC, announced Wednesday that he will <a href="af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7B000820111201?sp=true">recommend Bensouda as the sole candidate</a> [Reuters report] for the position, an endorsement to be made at a meeting of ICC members at which member states are required to reach an informal consensus on one candidate. That candidate then must receive an absolute majority of the formal vote via secret ballot at a session of the 118-nation ASP on December 12 in New York. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], which called for full transparency in the selection process, noted that the Rome Statute <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/international-criminal-court-ensure-best-candidate-elected-new-prosecutor-2011-10-2">sets out clear criteria for electing a Prosecutor</a> [press release], who "must be of high moral character and have extensive practical experience in the prosecution or trial of criminal cases." Bensouda has been Deputy Prosecutor of the ICC since 2004, and has long been considered the favorite to succeed Ocampo, as many of the ICC's cases currently focus on Africa. Additionally, Bensouda has the backing of the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website], the support of which has been critical to the ICC. If formally selected she will take office in July 2012.

<p>In October the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/Elections/Prosecutor/">Search Committee for the position of the Prosecutor of the ICC</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/four-candidates-named-as-potential-successors-to-icc-prosecutor.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] its consensus report to the Bureau of the ASP with the shortlist of four names after interviewing eight candidates from a list of 52 potentials. There was one other African on the list, Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, currently Chief Justice of the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/">Judiciary of Tanzania</a> [official website]. Also on the list were <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/ocp/cayley">Andrew Cayley</a> [official profile] of the UK, International Co-Prosecutor at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and Robert Petit of Canada, Counsel, <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/warcrimes-crimesdeguerre/home-accueil-eng.asp">Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes</a> [official website] Section of Canada's Department of Justice. As its first Prosecutor, Argentinian Ocampo has been widely praised for his promotion of the work of the ICC. During his tenure he has launched seven formal investigations, begun three <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-ends-first-war-crimes-trial.php">trials</a> and issued <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">arrest warrants for Sudanese president</a> [JURIST reports] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">Omar al-Bashir</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] and other military leaders wanted for human rights violations. However <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/hrw-report-criticizes-icc-prosecutions.php">Ocampo has also been criticized</a> [JURIST report] for the ICC's slow progress in achieving results, particularly in failing to bring a larger number of senior government officials to trial for various atrocities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The CPI scores 183 countries and territories from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean) based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, using data from 17 surveys collected by independent agencies concerning bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds, access to information, conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of any anti-corruption campaign at work in a country. New Zealand tops the list with a score of 9.5, followed by Denmark and Finland with 9.4 and Sweden with 9.3. The US again scored 7.1, ranking 24th, behind Qatar and Chile, tied for 22nd place, and ahead of France at 25th place. Greece came in 80th, tying Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, Morocco and Thailand. Most Arab Spring countries rank in the lower half of the index, scoring below 4. Transparency International Managing Director, Cobus de Swardt provided commentary:<blockquote>2011 saw the movement for greater transparency take on irresistible momentum, as citizens around the world demand accountability from their governments. High-scoring countries show that over time efforts to improve transparency can, if sustained, be successful and benefit their people.</blockquote>Before the Arab Spring a TI report on the region warned that nepotism, bribery and patronage were so deeply engrained in daily life that even existing anti-corruption laws had little impact. Last on the list is Somalia, ranked as the most corrupt country for the fourth year in a row and tied at 1.0 with North Korea, which this year was included in the index for the first time. Two-thirds of all ranked countries scored less than 5.

<p>In July <a href="http://www.rimlawyers.com/boston-attorneys-ma-lawyers/boston-lawyer-dimitrios-ioannidis-esq/">Dimitrios Ioannidis</a> of Roach, Ioannidis &#38; Megaloudis, LLC, noted TI's corruption quantification, writing that several recent cases of corrupt practices by US companies operating overseas highlights the <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/dimitrios-ioannidis-corrupt-practices.php">need for greater domestic and international enforcement mechanisms</a> [JURIST comment] to prevent such practices. <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/somalia-again-ranked-most-corrupt-country-in-annual-service.php">Last year's CPI report noted improvements</a> [JURIST report] over 2009's report in corruption perception in Bhutan, Chile, Ecuador, FYR Macedonia, Gambia, Haiti, Jamaica, Kuwait and Qatar, while that year Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Madagascar and Niger dropped in the rankings. This year TI identified Russia, Iran, France, the United Arab Emirates, Poland and Cuba as nations where improvement had been made. Conversely, Haiti, Zimbabwe, India, Saudi Arabia, Czech Republic, Ireland, Qatar and Costa Rica are nations where perceptions have deteriorated since last year. Along with Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan have continued to bottom the list consistently, going back to CPI reports from <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/corruption-problematic-in-both-poor-and.php">2008</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/myanmar-somalia-ranked-most-corrupt.php">2007</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/iraq-ranked-among-most-corrupt.php">2006</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Wednesday the <a href="http://nationalcouncilofsyria.com/">Syrian National Council</a> [official website], a civilian opposition group, agreed to <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/dissidents-from-syria-reveal-action-strategy.aspx?pageID=238&nID=8200&NewsCatID=338">coordinate resistance efforts</a> [<em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> report] with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9647000/9647572.stm">Free Syrian Army</a> [BBC report], the main military opposition group composed of Syrian military defectors. Pillay stated that Syria has "slipped into a state of Civil War."

<p>The Syrian government has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations since March when the first anti-government protests started. On Monday the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria reported that the Syrian Arab Republic has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">committed numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] including torture, sexual violence, use of excessive force and violations of the right to peaceful assembly. Last week, the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/N11/598/37/PDF/N1159837.pdf?OpenElement">draft resolution</a> [text, PDF] condemning the Syria's human rights violations calling for an immediate end to them. The death toll of Syrian protesters steadily increased since the beginning of the first outbreak of anti-government protests and earlier this month, the number <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-right-office-syria-death-toll-exceeds-3500.php">exceeded 3,500</a> [JURIST report], an increase of 900 from <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-reports-syria-death-toll-at-2600.php">September's number</a> [JURIST report]. The allegations of human rights violations continued to increase as well and last month, Syria was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/syria-urged-to-allow-un-investigation-of-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to allow UN human rights experts to conduct investigations into these allegations.

Acknowledging reports from international observers, MONUSCO indicated Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Roger Meece,<blockquote>shares the concerns expressed by the observer missions, in particular with regard to the reported irregularities and the need to assess their impact on the electoral process. He also deplores the violence that marred the elections in certain areas throughout the country and calls on all political leaders to urge their partisans to refrain from any violence or other acts that may disrupt the electoral process.</blockquote>MONUSCO urged all parties to remain calm and await the decision of the seven-member Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) on the preliminary results of the elections. MONUSCO also anticipatorily urged parties to address any grievances they may have through peaceful means, "including the established dispute mechanisms."

<p>The DRC has faced significant international pressure to ensure fair elections and prevent election violence. Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said his office would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecuter-drc-must-avoid-election-violence.php">prosecute individuals involved election violence</a> [JURIST report] in the DRC. The chief prosecutor's warning came just days after the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Joint Human Rights Office</a> (UNJHRO) [official website] on urged the DRC government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/drc-urged-to-prevent-rights-violations-linked-to-electoral-process.php">take action to abolish election-related violence</a> [JURIST report] before the presidential election on November 28. UNJHRO reported 188 cases of human rights violations related to the electoral process during the period between November 2010 and September 2011.  a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/New-Congolese-Electoral-Body-to-Organize-Next-Years-Election--99733769.html">Established in 2010 to organize the presidential elections</a> [VOA report], CENI replaced the previous election commission that was widely discredited when <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-arrests-six-election-officials.php">six officials were arrested for electoral fraud</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Senate on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-rejects-amendment-to-detainee-provision-in-defense-spending-bill.php">rejected an amendment to the bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have struck the provision and instituted a timeline to allow further study and investigation on the issue of counterterrorism by Congress. The provision grants the military complete custody and control over terror suspects and grants authority to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] over whether suspects should be tried in military or civilian courts. Opponents of the provision fear it could be applied to US citizens threatening their constitutional liberties. Supporters argue that the idea of an American citizen suspected of aiding <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">news archive</a>] not getting due process is simply a lie. The bill could still face a presidential veto, in accordance with a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] the White House released in November which warned that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] could <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/obama-threatens-veto-of-defense-spending-bill-over-detainee-provision.php">veto legislation</a> [JURIST report] if it "challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, [or] protect the Nation." The White House maintains the position that the FBI should have unrestricted access and interrogation rights over domestically detained al Qaeda suspects, rather than the military.

<p>The provision was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] in a unanimous vote after disagreements regarding the provision had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked their passage for months</a> [CNN report]. The passage by the SASC came shortly after an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [PDF] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. The report posits that certain US policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to close the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news archive], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The laws, the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/documents/actsandordinances/J&K_Specialpoweract.htm">Armed Forces Special Powers Act</a> (AFSPA) [text] and the <a href="http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/Laws/Jammu-And-Kashmir-Disturbed-Areas-Act-1992.htm">Disturbed Areas Act</a> (DAA) [text], were introduced in India in 1990, and both grant significant authority to the country's army and paramilitary forces to detain people, destroy property, enter, search, and seize without warrant, arrest without warrant, and even use deadly force. The demonstration was led by the <a href="http://kashmirbarassociation.com/index.html">Kashmir Bar Association</a> (KBA), [website] whose members met on November 29 and unanimously agreed that they would refrain from entering Kashmir courthouses on Thursday in protest of a government proposal for amending the Jammu and Kashmir criminal procedure rules to incorporate provisions of the AFSPA, which would afford the Armed Forces greater protection from prosecution. The <a href="http://kashmirbarassociation.com/press_releases/pr29112011.html">KBA issued its perspective</a> [press release] following the meeting:
<blockquote>[T]he amendment in the Cr.P.C. and RPC to create a protective cover for the armed forces in Jammu and Kashmir is virtually incorporation of the provisions of AFSPA and create permanent protection to the Armed Forces for their anti-human actions and Bar Association should resist such a move and educate the public at large and political parties should mobilize public opinion against this state adventure.</blockquote>Although Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister <a href="http://www.omarabdullah.com/">Omar Abdullah</a> [personal website] has publicly stated that the revocation of the AFSPA is inevitable, the KBA believes these revisions to the criminal code may be the government's way of preserving AFSPA protections. Abdullah, on the other hand, has asserted that state government could consider restoring these criminal procedure rules to ensure that the region's security forces are simply given the same protections afforded to those in other parts of the country. 

<p>Kashmir has consistently faced criticism of its laws over the course of the year, particularly in light of the uneasy circumstances throughout the region. In October, Abdullah's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/kashmir-amends-tough-detention-law.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] its highly-criticized <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,LEGISLATION,IND,,3ae6b52014,0.html">Public Safety Act</a> (PSA) [text], which formerly treated those persons 16 years and older as adults, allowing them to be arrested. <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/india-and-pakistan-resume-peace-talks.php">Jammu and Kashmir has been plagued with unrest</a> [JURIST report] since it became part of India in the middle of the twentieth century. Although the state is officially part of India, the territory has been disputed by Pakistan and India since 1947. This friction within the region has led to several conflicts, including the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1947-1948 and 1965. There was also a large show of military force by both nations in the region in 2002 which caused international alarm in light of both nations possessing nuclear weapons. India has long-attempted to parry the unrest and a burgeoning separatist movement in the region by detaining human rights political activists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the <a href="http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL98-507.pdf">1984 National Organ Transplant Act</a> (NOTA) [42 USC &#167; 273, PDF], which criminalizes the compensation for the transfer of human organs, does not apply to a type of bone marrow donation known as "apheresis." Apheresis is a procedure developed within the last 20 years whereby the donor undergoes a series of injections over five days in order to stimulate production of hematopoietic blood cells in the blood flowing through the donor's veins. The donor then sits for a period of hours while the donor's blood is filtered through a machine designed to remove the hematopoietic cells. The court analogized the apheresis procedure with the normal procedure of donating blood, and noted that the NOTA does not prohibit compensation for the donation of blood. The NOTA explicitly prohibits compensation for providing bone marrow, but the court rejected the government's argument that the hematopoietic cells should be considered "bone marrow" simply because they were produced by the marrow of the bone. The court stated that if definition of the term "bone marrow" were to include any blood product produced by the marrow, then compensation for blood donors would also have to be prohibited because red and white blood cells are also produced by the marrow. The court noted that they construe the term "bone marrow" to mean the "soft, fatty substance in bone cavities, as opposed to blood, which means the red liquid that flows through the blood vessels." The court also determined that because the apheresis procedure had not been developed when the NOTA was enacted, Congress could not have intended for the Act to prohibit the procedure. They further held that the apheresis method of bone marrow transplantation "is not a transfer of a 'human organ' or a 'subpart thereof' as defined by the statute and regulation" so therefore, the statute does not criminalize the compensation of apheresis bone marrow donors. 

<p>The lawsuit challenging the application of the law to bone marrow donation was brought by a non-profit organization called <a href="http://moremarrowdonors.org/">MoreMarrowDonors.org</a> [advocacy website], as well as plaintiffs who claimed they were unable to find bone marrow donors because it is more difficult for ethnic minorities and people of mixed race to find genetic donors for bone marrow. MoreMarrowDonors.org plans to begin a pilot program that would offer <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-bone-marrow-donors-paid-15070919">$3,000 in compensation</a> [AP report] in the form of scholarships, housing allowances or gifts to charity, to bone marrow donors who undergo the apheresis procedure, in the hopes they will attract more minority donors, thereby increasing the number of potential genetic matches. According to the plaintiffs, nearly <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/01/BA821M7377.DTL">3,000 Americans die each year</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] while attempting to find a genetically appropriate bone marrow donor. Use of the traditional "aspiration" method of bone marrow extraction, contributed to the lack of appropriate donors due to the invasive, painful method of the procedure which required extraction of the marrow from the donors' bones using a long needle. Under the court's ruling, compensation for aspiration bone marrow transplants remains illegal because it was specifically prohibited by Congress under the statute. Aspiration bone marrow transplants currently account for approximately 30-percent of bone marrow transplants, while the remainder of bone marrow transplants are performed using the less invasive apheresis method.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tucson patrol officer Martin Escobar <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration.php">challenged the law</a> [JURIST report] last year, claiming standing as an officer "mandated to enforce SB 1070." He argued that he has standing because, "if he refuses to enforce the Act, he can be disciplined by his employer," and if he does enforce it, he "can be subject to costly civil actions" for "deprivation of civil rights of the individual against whom he enforces the Act." The appeals court rejected these arguments and upheld a decision by the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-dismisses-police-officer-suit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">dismiss the suit</a> [JURIST report]. The appeals court also rejected Escobar's claim that he has standing as a Hispanic living in Arizona because he "alleged insufficient facts" to show injury based on this claim and that "mere conclusory allegations" are not enough to show injury. Arizona Gover Jan Brewer said in a <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_120111_Escobar.pdf">press release</a> [text, PDF] that she is "pleased" with the appeals court's decision and she will "continue to defend" the law.

<p>Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/11-182%20Arizona%20Opp.pdf">urged</a> [brief, PDF] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official websites] not to hear Arizona's appeal of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/04/11/10-16645_opinion.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] enjoining four provisions of SB 1070. The Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld an injunction</a> in April before the law ever took effect, and Arizona is now <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asking the high court</a> [JURIST reports] to address whether the state law is preempted by federal immigration legislation.

Ocampo began the process by asking Pre-Trial Chamber I to review the evidence against Hussein and decide whether an arrest warrant should be issued. Ocampo believes that there is enough evidence to link Hussein to these crimes and that the ICC should arrest Hussein to prevent him from further actions and continue to investigate the Sudanese government's actions during that time. Ocampo said:<blockquote>The evidence shows that directly and through Mr. Harun, Mr. Hussein played a central role in coordinating the crimes, including in recruiting, mobilizing, funding, arming, training and the deployment of the Militia/Janjaweed as part of the Government of the Sudan forces, with the knowledge that these forces would commit the crimes.</blockquote>Ocampo said Hussein is still presumed innocent and will be given an opportunity to defend himself. Ocampo is scheduled to brief the UN Security Council on this issue on December 15.

<p>This will be the fourth case the ICC will be hearing in relation to crimes committed in Darfur.

Last month, McMahon <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-for-madoff-victims.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Picard's suit seeking damages from banks and third parties for the victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In her decision, Mcmahon concluded that Picard did not have standing to sue on behalf of the victims. Picard was designated by the court in 2008 as <a href="http://www.madoff.com/News.aspx">trustee</a> [official website] of the assets seized from the Ponzi scheme.

<p>Lawsuits against JPMorgan continue to be brought to court. Last month, two former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] investors filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against JP Morgan seeking recovery of $19 billion for allegedly aiding Madoff in orchestrating his Ponzi scheme. Another case from earlier this year was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18079616256181220542&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">dismissed</a> [opinion] against <a href="http://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/3/personal?home=personal&code=PPG0011159&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=HBUS_PPG0011159">HSBC Holdings</a> [corporate website] because the trustee had "no personal stake in the outcome of the controversy." Picard plans to appeal this decision. The first payouts to Madoff's victims were <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the court in July. Picard <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">filed almost 60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010 after being <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff/trusteeorder.pdf">appointed trustee</a> [order] in 2008. Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme in March 2009, and was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW reported that 18 civilians have been killed and about 100 seriously wounded during unrest following the presidential elections in the DRC on November 28. HRW reported that the Republican Guard soldiers were responsible for most of the deaths. The report was based on HRW staff who worked alongside Congolese human rights activists, serving as election observers during the presidential election. HRW's statement says:<blockquote>The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials state that security forces shall apply nonviolent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. They may use lethal force only when it is strictly necessary to protect life. The Basic Principles state that, "Governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their law."</blockquote> HRW also urged the government to take steps to hold the individuals accountable who either participated in the post-election violence or attempted to commit election fraud.

<p>The DRC has faced significant international pressure to ensure fair elections and prevent election violence. On Thursday, top UN officials with the <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=932">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (MONUSCO) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-officials-deplore-post-election-violence-in-drc-call-for-restraint.php">decried</a> [JURIST report] post-election violence in the DRC and called for restraint. MONUSCO urged all parties to remain calm and await the decision of the seven-member Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) on the preliminary results of the elections.  Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said his office would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecuter-drc-must-avoid-election-violence.php">prosecute individuals involved election violence</a> [JURIST report] in the DRC. The chief prosecutor's warning came just days after the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Joint Human Rights Office</a> (UNJHRO) [official website] on urged the DRC government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/drc-urged-to-prevent-rights-violations-linked-to-electoral-process.php">take action to abolish election-related violence</a> [JURIST report] before the presidential election on November 28.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay said that during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">eight-month uprising</a> [JURIST news archive] the death toll in Syria has <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-more-than-4000-dead-in-syria-conflict.php">surpassed 4,000</a> [JURIST report] with tens of thousands arrested and over 14,000 detained as a result of the crackdown. The Human Rights Council established an Independent International Commission of Inquiry to investigate the human rights violations in Syria during the eight-month uprising. Pillay stated:<blockquote>The Commission's report documents widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Syrian authorities by acts such as: killing of children by beating or shooting during demonstrations, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. It records at least 256 deaths of children&#8212;I understand since increased to 307 children&#8212;and instances of schools being used as detention facilities, demonstrating the State's disregard for children's right to education and personal safety. The Commission collected evidence of sexual violence against civilians, especially sexual torture of male detainees and children and sexual assaults upon women in places of detention.</blockquote>Pillay expressed that if the actions of the Syrian government are not stopped now, the country faces the threat of a civil war.

<p>The Syrian government has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations since March when the first anti-government protests started. On Wednesday the <a href="http://nationalcouncilofsyria.com/">Syrian National Council</a> [official website], a civilian opposition group, agreed to coordinate resistance efforts with the Free Syrian Army, the main military opposition group composed of Syrian military defectors. On Monday the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria reported that the Syrian Arab Republic has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">committed numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] including torture, sexual violence, use of excessive force and violations of the right to peaceful assembly. Last week, the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/N11/598/37/PDF/N1159837.pdf?OpenElement">draft resolution</a> [text, PDF] condemning the Syria's human rights violations calling for an immediate end to them.

Abdelrazik was added to the list while being held in Sudan in 2006 based on suspected ties to <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. He was seized while visiting Sudan in 2003 on a request from the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> [official website], and he alleges that he was <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/turns+anger+over+exile/5799473/story.html#ixzz1fOKiukPs">tortured</a> [<em>Montreal Gazette</em> report] until he was released in 2004. Abdelrazik was denied the ability to fly home from Sudan because he had been placed on the US no fly list. In July 2006 the US officially designated Abdelrazik as a <a href="http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/Treasury_Designation_Abd_Al-Razziq.pdf">terrorist</a> [press release, PDF] because he allegedly "provided administrative and logistical support to al Qaeda, and has been identified as being close to Abu Zubayda, a former lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, involved in al Qaeda recruitment and training," and the UN officially added him to the 1267 List. The 1267 List was initially established pursuant to UN <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1267%281999%29">resolution 1267</a> [text, PDF; official <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/index.shtml">website</a>] to control members of the Taliban and their suspected associates. The 1267 List was <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1390%282002%29">expanded</a> [resolution 1390 text, PDF] in 2002 to include suspected members of al Qaeda and its associates. Individuals on the <a href="http://www.peoplescommission.org/en/abdelrazik/1267.php">1267 List</a> [1267 fact sheet] are subject to an international ban on a travel, arms embargo and have all of their assets frozen. According to the <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/pdf/1267_guidelines.pdf">1267 guidelines</a> [text, PDF] a criminal conviction or charge is not required for an individual to be placed on the list. Individuals are not informed when they are placed on the list and, prior to 2008, an individual placed on the list was not provided with any information as to why they were placed on the list. Abdelrazik had been the subject of a campaign to be returned to Canada and to be removed from the UN no fly list from several groups, including the <a href="http://travelwatchlist.ca/About_the_ICLMG">International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group</a> (ICLM), <a href="http://www.peoplescommission.org/en/abdelrazik/">Project Fly Home</a> and <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/endtorturenow/bring-abousfian-abdelrazik-home">End Torture Now</a> [advocacy websites]. In Jun 2009 a judge for the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2009/2009fc580/2009fc580.html">ordered</a> [text] the Canadian government to fly Abdelrazik back home, but upon returning he learned that he had been placed on the 1267 and had not been removed despite being cleared of all wrongdoing. Being on the 1267 List made it impossible for Abdelrazik to get a job because he could not be paid since his bank accounts were frozen and it exposed his family members and friends to potential criminal sanctions if they gave gifts to him. Abdelrazik, along with ICLM and the <a href="http://www.bccla.org/">BC Civil Liberties Association</a> [advocacy website], is currently <a href="www.peoplescommission.org/files/abousfianMedia/1267Application.pdf">challenging</a> [complaint, PDF] the Canadian legislation which implemented the 1267 List as a violation of section 7 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom</a> [materials] and sections 1(a) and 1(e) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-12.3/page-1.html#h-1">Canadian Bill of Rights</a> [text].

<p>No fly lists and other blacklists have been an issue of international concern in the wake of growing worry over terrorism. In July 2010 the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed suit on behalf of 10 US citizens and legal residents against the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-to-challenging-us-no-fly-list.php">challenging their inclusion on the US no fly list</a> [JURIST report]. Just like Abdelrazik, the ACLU argues that their inclusion on the US no fly list, without ever being informed as to why they were included, has left these individuals stranded abroad. In 2006, the FBI and the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/public/">Transportation Security Administration</a> [official website] agreed to pay the ACLU $200,000 in attorney's fees to settle a case brought by the civil rights organization in 2003 <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aclu-settles-no-fly-list-case-with-us.php">challenging the government's no-fly list</a> [JURIST report] and requesting the disclosure of records. The documents noted that construction of the list was based on "two primary principles," but that there were "no hard and fast" rules governing decisions of who was put on the list. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in 2008 that those placed on the government's "no-fly list" can <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ninth-circuit-rules-people-on-no-fly.php">challenge their inclusion on the list</a> [JURIST report] in federal district courts. The court held that the Terrorist Screening Center, which actually maintains the list, is a subsection of the FBI and is therefore subject to review by the district courts. Also in 2008, the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/plus/a0816/final.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] saying that the FBI had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/fbi-submitted-inaccurate-data-to.php">submitted inaccurate information to the list</a> [JURIST report], that the information was rarely reviewed before its submission and even if discrepancies become apparent they were often left unchanged.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNHRC resolution sets the stage for <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/02/world/meast/syria-unrest/?hpt=wo_c1">action by other UN bodies</a> [CNN report] and international institutions, calling for the appointment of a special human rights investigator on Syria, the suspension of Syrian security forces suspected of human rights violations and the release of prisoners of conscience held by Syrian authorities. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">eight-month uprising</a> [JURIST news archive] challenging the autocratic rule of President Bashar Assad has resulted in a bloody government crackdown that has seen <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-more-than-4000-dead-in-syria-conflict.php">over 4,000 people killed</a> [JURIST report], with tens of thousands arrested and over 14,000 detained. The UNHRC resolution came after the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria reported earlier this week that the Syrian government has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">committed numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] including torture, sexual violence, use of excessive force and violations of the right to peaceful assembly. The measure passed with 37 votes against four, with six nations abstaining. China and Russia were among the four nations voting against the resolution, citing fear of a military intervention like this year's international intercession in Libya. The Syrian ambassador told the council that the situation would be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15996583">worsened by UN intervention</a> [BBC report] and that the international community could not provide a solution to Syria's problems. Nevertheless upon passage of the resolution the UNHRC decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] for action and transmission to all relevant UN bodies. The UNHRC measure has been reported as the toughest resolution ever passed by the Geneva-based council.

<p>The Syrian government has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations since March when the first anti-government protests started. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] Friday <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-refer-syria-conflict-to-icc-for-investigation.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for investigation into crimes against humanity committed by the Syrian government. On Wednesday the <a href="http://nationalcouncilofsyria.com/">Syrian National Council</a> [official website], a civilian opposition group, agreed to coordinate resistance efforts with the Free Syrian Army, the main military opposition group composed of Syrian military defectors. Last week the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/C.3/66/L.57/Rev.1">draft resolution</a> [text, PDF] condemning Syria's human rights violations and calling for their immediate end. Pillay previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">called for an ICC probe</a> [JURIST report] into the situation in Syria in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling party's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16014663">decision to support same-sex marriage</a> [BBC report] followed emotional debate and speeches from both sides of the issue at its national conference in Sydney, where 400 delegates voted to amend the party's platform while accepting Prime Minister Julia Gillard's call for the party to accept a conscience vote on the issue. Gillard, who is personally opposed to same-sex marriage, has said her government will not seek to change Australia's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma196185/index.html">Marriage Act 1961</a> [text], which defines the union as between a man and and a woman, and has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/australia-pm-proposes-vote-on-same-sex-marriage.php">called on Australia's Parliament</a> [JURIST report] to vote on whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Such a measure will likely fail in parliament, given that the Labor Party has a thin majority and the conservative opposition party does not support same-sex marriage. The platform amendment came days after the <a href = "http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/">Queensland Parliament</a> [official website] passed <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/queensland-passes-civil-unions-law.php">legislation to legally recognize civil unions</a> between same-sex couples, joining its fellow states of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tasmania-approves-law-recognizing-foreign-same-sex-marriages.php">Tasmania</a>, New South Wales, Victoria and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/australian-capital-region-passes-same.php">Australian Capital Territory</a> (ACT) [JURIST reports] in recognizing civil unions. Gillard's proposal was accepted by a vote of 208 to 184, and the vote to amend the party platform was accepted on voices.

<p>Australia historically has had a tumultuous past regarding the legal rights of same-sex couples. In May 2008, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dnp-australia-capital-abandons-plan-to.php">abandoned a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to legally recognize same-sex civil union ceremonies after the Australian federal government threatened to veto <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/b/db_27837/default.asp">Civil Partnerships Bill 2006</a> [legislative materials] if it passed the <a href="http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/">Legislative Assembly</a> [official website]. The Civil Partnerships Bill was introduced after an <a href="http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2006-22/default.asp">earlier civil unions law</a> [legislative materials] was actually <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-federal-government-nixes.php">overturned by the federal government</a> [JURIST report] because that law's attempt to equate civil unions with marriage was determined to be unacceptable. In April of 2008, the Australian government introduced legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/australia-to-amend-laws-to-end-same-sex.php">amend over 100 federal laws</a> [JURIST report] to remove discrimination against same-sex couples but continued to bar same-sex marriage. While mandated by federal legislation as unrecognized, currently same-sex couples do have equal rights with heterosexual couples in areas such as pension schemes and medical benefits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The panel declared that the prosecution's request for a reduction in the indictment was permissible under applicable law:<blockquote>Under Rule 73 his (D) of the Rules, having heard the Prosecution, a Chamber may, in the interest of a fair and expeditious trial, invite the Prosecution to reduce the number of counts charged in the indictment and may fix a number of crime sites or incidents comprised in one or more of the charges in respect of which evidence may be presented by the Prosecution which, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, are reasonably representative of the crimes charged. The relevant circumstances include the crimes charged in the indictment, their classification and nature, the places where they are alleged to have been committed, their scale, and the victims of the crimes.</blockquote> The panel <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10868">stated</a> [press release] that the prosecution in two weeks will file both an amended indictment and an updated list of victims. Two weeks ago, ICTY prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-speed-up-mladic-trial-reduce-evidence.php">sought to lower the number of crimes in their indictment of Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in order to speed up his trial. The request came one day after a panel of ICTY judges <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/tord/en/111116.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] the appointment of a medical expert to conduct a medical examination and issue a report on Mladic's health. Mladic will still face trial on two counts of genocide along with nine other charges. 

<p>In October, the ICTY prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">refused to seek further appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the tribunal's refusal to split Mladic's trial into separate actions: one for his conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. At his <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">second appearance</a> [JURIST report] he refused to enter a plea. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

District Judge Lucy Koh's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/03/us-apple-samsung-ruling-idUSTRE7B206D20111203">ruling against Apple</a> [Reuters report] is the latest decision in a legal battle, which began in April when Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung alleging that its "Galaxy" line of products copies Apple's iPhone and iPad technology. As a result, Apple had requested that the court prevent Samsung from selling three of its smartphone models as well as its tablet, the Samsung Tab 10.1 in the US market. However, in deciding to deny the preliminary injunction, the judge held that it was not yet clear that the requested remedy would prevent Apple from being irreparably harmed. Apple may still prevail on its claims, but needs to prove both infringement and validity. Apple has attempted to ban sales of Samsung products in other countries as well. On Friday, an Australian court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-apple-samsung-australia-idUSTRE7B104M20111202">extended a ban on the sale of the products</a> [Reuters report], which was set to expire at 4 p.m., by at least a week, giving Apple an opportunity to appeal a high court decision that overturned a temporary ban that had been in effect since July.

<p>As smartphones and tablets continue to increase in popularity, companies increasingly seek to protect the technology involved in their creation. Last month, the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-trade-commission-clears-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Apple on a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/htc-files-patent-infringement-complaint-against-apple.php">patent complaint</a> [JURIST report] brought by <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=4">HTC</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2498:TT">backgrounder</a>]. The USITC found that Apple had not violated Section 337 of the <a href="http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/trademarks/PreLanhamAct_088_Act_of_1930.pdf">Tariff Act of 1930</a> [PDF] by reasons of infringement of Patent Nos. <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,658,146.PN.&OS=PN/6,658,146&RS=PN/6,658,146">6,658,146</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,683,978.PN.&OS=PN/6,683,978&RS=PN/6,683,978">6,683,978</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,775,417.PN.&OS=PN/6,775,417&RS=PN/6,775,417">6,775,417</a> and <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,043,087.PN.&OS=PN/7,043,087&RS=PN/7,043,087">7,043,087</a> [texts]. These patents relate to HTC's recently acquired subsidiary S3 Graphics Co. The USITC ruling rejects the request to limit imports of MAC computers, the iPhone and the iPad. The decision also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-21/apple-wins-patent-fight-with-s3-graphics-at-u-s-trade-agency.html">calls into question the rationale of the S3 acquisition</a> [Bloomberg report] and could put pressure on HTC stock shares. HTC said it may challenge the ruling in the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website], which specializes in patent law. This USITC ruling followed an earlier one in July which held that <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">HTC infringed two Apple patents</a> [JURIST report] relating to the Android operating system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hg6jdx-5_QR0Q0omowminKkjNEFQ?docId=CNG.794d1157fe2364fc0e0dcd6a77edbd08.4e1">bill includes requirements</a> [AFP report] that demonstrators must comply with in order to hold a peaceful protest, one of which involves notifying the authorities five days in advance of when, where and for what purpose they will be protesting. If notice is not given, protesters face up to one year in jail. The law, which overturns previous <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/a-law-for-peaceful-protest-20111204-1odfq.html">restrictions banning all protests</a> [<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> report], was passed by the parliament in November but will now become effective, having received the president's approval. The passage of the bill is the latest measure the new government has taken in an attempt to improve its international reputation following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. 

<p>While Myanmar continues to take steps forward in its reformation efforts, it has recently faced struggles with regards to the status of human rights within the country. Last month, human rights group <a href="http://www.partnersworld.org/index.html">Partners Relief and Development</a> [advocacy website] said that Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/myanmar-soldiers-may-be-committing-war-crimes-rights-group.php">soldiers may be committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report] in the form of torture and forced labor against ethnic communities in Kachin State. The group issued a <a href="http://partnersworld.org/usa/images/stories/crimes_in_northern_burma/crimes_in_northern_burma.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, graphic content] documenting the war crimes which allegedly began on June 9 after a 17-year ceasefire agreement was broken to begin a war between the Myanmar army and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8528985.stm">Kachin Independence Army</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Evidence for the alleged war crimes was gathered from first-hand interviews of witnesses in Myanmar. The report calls attention to Myanmar's legal obligations and highlights that it has failed to honor its obligations under human rights law and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] and that it may also be subject to charges from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The report calls on the UN to conduct an investigation into the war crimes in Myanmar. Earlier in November, the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/myanmar-rights-body-urges-release-of-political-prisoners.php">urged Sein to release political prisoners</a> [JURIST report]. In an open letter to Sein published in three state-owned newspapers, the MNHRC indicated that domestic and international support would follow the prisoners' release. Sein had granted amnesty to 6,359 prisoners in October following a similar open letter issued by the MNHRC. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The CFTC adopted a Position Limits Rule on October 18 on the grounds that the rule was authorized by the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/CommodityExchangeAct/index.htm">Commodities Exchange Act</a> [CFTC backgrounder], and published the rule in the Federal Register. The regulation restricts the maximum number of derivatives contracts to purchase or sell a commodity a trader or group of traders may hold during a specified period of time. The trade groups argue that, in contravention of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) [text], the Commission acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and contrary to law" by failing to support the regulation with sufficient evidence and that the Commission was not obligated by statute to implement the position limits:<blockquote>Congress did not require the Commission to establish position limits without regard to whether they would harm the US economy by increasing the cost of food, energy, and other necessities. Rather, Congress authorized the Commission to establish position limits <em>only</em> if it first finds that they "are necessary to diminish, eliminate, or prevent" "an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce" caused by "[e]xcessive speculation," and are otherwise "appropriate." The Commission did not make those findings here.</blockquote> The trade groups further argue that the Commission's cost/benefit analysis of the rule was inadequate, and are seeking injunctive relief.

<p>The CFTC has been tasked with regulating the derivatives market as a result of the <a target="_blank" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [text, PDF]. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 and created the new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent companies from becoming "too big to fail." In addition to creating the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treas.gov/FSOC/">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [official website], the legislation also gives the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] new oversight over the largest financial institutions, creates a bureau of consumer protection, introduces multitudes of new regulations on derivatives and other financial instruments and limits the amount of capital banks can invest in hedge funds. JURIST contributor Andrew Cali-Vasquez argues that position limit regulations may carry <a href="/dateline/2011/10/andrew-cali-vazquez-dodd-frank.php">unexpected consequences</a> [JURIST op-ed] that "could impinge upon the operations of domestic businesses by reducing the availability of financing."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Afghanistan created a transitional government and announced intentions to hold elections and create a new constitution when the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/latest/afghan/afghan-agree.htm">Bonn Agreement</a> [text] was signed on December 5, 2001. HRW reports that in the last ten years, the Afghanistan justice system "remains weak" and that human rights abuses are rampant in the alternative traditional justice system, where civilians  are often forced to resolve disputes in Taliban courts. HRW also reported that Afghan leaders have not done enough to encourage increased political representation by women. HRW Asia director Brad Adams enumerated some of the failed reforms:<blockquote>Human rights, and in particular women's rights, were cited as a key benefit of the defeat of Taliban rule in 2001. But ten years later, many basic rights are still ignored or downplayed. While there have been improvements, the rights situation is still dominated by poor governance, lack of rule of law, impunity for militias and police, laws and policies that harm women, and conflict-related abuses.</blockquote>HRW has called on leaders who will attend the upcoming Bonn Conference to support Afghanistan in the ongoing reform of justice, women's rights, health and education.

<p>Afghanistan's human rights record has been scrutinized in recent years. The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/default.aspx?/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] reported in October that prisoners in some Afghan-run detention facilities have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">beaten and tortured</a> [JURIST report]. HRW reported in September that the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">committing serious abuses</a> [JURIST report], and the Afghan government is doing little to hold the officials accountable. Corruption, abuse of power and a focus on short-term security goals in Afghanistan have <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensified the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report] affecting more than two-thirds of the population, according to a March 2010 <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/SPdocs/Countries/AF/PovertyReport_30032010.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] from the UN's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website].

Michel noted that although most pirate attacks are unsuccessful, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1070461.stm">Seychelles</a> [BBC backgrounder] yacht tourism has taken a hit, and prices for shipping from the small island nation have skyrocketed because of concern over pirate activity.

In July 2010, the Supreme Court of Seychelles <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">convicted a group of Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report], sentencing them to 10 years in prison.

Other countries that have attempted to prosecute pirates include the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/three-somali-pirates-charged-in-highjacking-that-killed-4-americans.php">US</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/5-somalis-go-on-trial-for-piracy-in-dutch-court.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Howards</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pet_Howards.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case dealing with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The petitioners are two Secret Service agents who arrested the respondent, Steven Howards, following an encounter with then-US vice president Dick Cheney. Petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards, who in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_18_00001001----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 1001</a> [text] falsely denied making unsolicited physical contact with the vice president. Howards later brought a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] retaliatory arrest claim against petitioners. The issues before the court are (1) whether the existence of probable cause to make an arrest bars a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim; and (2) whether arresting officers are entitled to qualified and absolute immunity where probable cause existed for respondent's arrest, the arrest comported with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text], it was not (and is not) clearly established that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-1495.ZS.html">Hartman v. Moore</a> [opinion] does not apply to First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims, and the denial of immunity threatens to interfere with the decisions of Secret Service agents protecting the president and vice president. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the First Amendment claim is not barred and that petitioners are not entitled to qualified immunity on the First Amendment claim.

<p>In 2006, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/supreme-court-decides-tax-sale.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Hartman v. Moore</span> that "a plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution action must plead and show the absence of probable cause for pressing the underlying criminal charges." William Moore was tried and acquitted on charges that he and his company improperly influenced the search for a new Postmaster General, and he subsequently sued a group of postal inspectors, arguing that they had encouraged his prosecution in retaliation for his earlier lobbying efforts to win US Postal Service contracts. In the 5-2 ruling, the court reversed a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/ACB89050BC78772D85256F82006D6472/$file/03-5241a.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] rejecting the inspectors' motion for summary judgment because the criminal charges against Moore were supported by probable cause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Greece objects to FYROM's use of "Macedonia" out of concern that the country will use the moniker to <a href="/dateline/2008/05/greece-macedonia-issue.php">make claims to regions of Northern Greece</a> [JURIST comment] that also are known by the name Macedonia. Greece vetoed FYROM's attempt to join NATO in 2008. The ICJ ruled 15-1 that Greece violated the Interim Accord of September 13, 1995, in which they agreed not to veto the FYROM's bid to join NATO while the issue over the FYROM's name was being negotiated. The ICJ found that Greece breached its "obligation not to object to the [FYROM]'s admission to or membership in NATO" under Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Interim Accord. The ICJ order may be a largely symbolic victory for FYROM because the court did not sanction Greece, nor did it order the country to refrain from taking similar action in the future. 

<p>Greece's <a href="http://www1.mfa.gr/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Greek] released a <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&to=en&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.mfa.gr%2Fepikairotita%2Fproto-thema%2Fanakoinose-upourgeiou-exoterikon-skhetika-me-ten-apophase-tou-diethnous-dikasteriou-tes-khages-51211.html">statement</a> [text] calling for the FYROM to continue negotiations in cooperation with the UN to resolve the longstanding naming conflict. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Greece "will continue to negotiate in good faith [and w]e hope that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will come in these negotiations in good faith, as the issue of the name can be resolved only through negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations." In a brief <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-7D86152D-C4849725/natolive/news_81678.htm">statement</a> [text] following the ruling, NATO Secretary General <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/who_is_who_56703.htm">Anders Fogh Rasmussen</a> [official profile] took note of the decision, but declared that the order "does not affect the decision taken by NATO Allies at the Bucharest summit in 2008 ... an invitation will be extended to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In October, defense lawyers for Nuon Chea <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/khmer-rouge-leader-defense-team-files-suit-against-cambodia-pm.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] for interfering with the UN-backed war crimes tribunal.

Because of the old age of the defendants, the tribunal decided to split the case into a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report]. The first trial will focus on the beginning two phases of population movement and allegations of crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution not on religious grounds and forced disappearances associated with the first phases of population movement. Subsequent trials will focus on the third phase of population movement, genocide, persecution based on religious grounds and violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The first segment of the trial is expected to conclude by December 16 for a recess and will resume after the break on January 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban reminded leaders to create development opportunities and noted his plans to address development at an upcoming conference:<blockquote>Today we are at a decisive moment in history. As calls for change echo across the world, we cannot take refuge in silence. Leaders must respond to the demands of people who seek to build their own future. They should especially work to help women and youth enjoy lives of dignity, equality and opportunity. Global challenges and crises are interconnected. Economic, social and environmental concerns are inseparable. And human rights are integral to them all. That is why we are placing sustainable development at the top of the international agenda. Next year's United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, will offer a critical opportunity to chart a course to the future we want.</blockquote>The Declaration states that everyone is "entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized."

<p>The UN has taken action to highlight areas of what it sees as fundamental human rights of the broader global community. In November, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food <a href="http://www.srfood.org/">Olivier De Schutter</a> [official website] urged the <a href="http://www.wto.org/index.htm">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-urges-wto-to-make-right-to-food-a-priority.php">make food security a top priority</a> [JURIST report] at future meetings.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-844.pdf">Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd v. Novo Nordisk A/S</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on drug patents. When the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] approves a drug for multiple uses, the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&docid=f:s1225is.txt.pdf">Hatch-Waxman Act</a> [text, PDF] allows generic drug makers to avoid contested patent litigation by marketing generic versions of the drug solely for non-patented uses. The FDA lacks the authority and expertise needed to verify the patent information submitted by name-brand drug companies, however, so it defers to their descriptions of the scope of their patents. Such companies can therefore block the approval of generic drugs by submitting overbroad patent descriptions to the FDA, effectively extending their patents to cover non-infringing uses. To combat this problem, the Act <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/usc_sec_21_00000355----000-.html">allows</a> [21 USC &#167; 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) text] a "counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [patent] holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug." The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/03-25-Caraco-Opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the counterclaim provision effectively authorizes only "delet[ing]" improperly listed patents, but not "correct[ing]" information that misrepresents the scope of the approved uses claimed by a patent. Petitioners claim that ruling expressly invalidates longstanding FDA regulations defining "patent information," which the FDA deems "essential" to administering the Act, without seeking the agency&#8217;s views. The question before the court is whether the counterclaim provision applies when (1) there is "an approved method of using the drug" that "the patent does not claim," and (2) the brand submits "patent information" to the FDA that misstates the patent&#8217;s scope, requiring "correct[ion]."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-704.pdf">Messerschmidt v. Millender</a> [transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether police officers are entitled to <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] where they execute search warrants later determined invalid. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/08/24/07-55518.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the officers in this case were not entitled to qualified immunity. The Supreme Court has held in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/468/897/case.html">United States v. Leon</a> and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/475/335/">Malley v. Briggs</a> [opinions] that officers are entitled to qualified immunity, and evidence obtained should not be suppressed, so long as the warrant is not "so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable." The questions before the court are (1) Under these standards, are officers entitled to qualified immunity where they obtained a facially valid warrant to search for firearms, firearm-related materials, and gang-related items in the residence of a gang member and felon who had threatened to kill his girlfriend and fired a sawed-off shotgun at her, and a district attorney approved the application, no factually on-point case law prohibited the search, and the alleged overbreadth in the warrant did not expand the scope of the search; and (2) Should the Malley/Leon standards be reconsidered or clarified in light of lower courts' inability to apply them in accordance with their purpose of deterring police misconduct, resulting in imposition of liability on officers for good faith conduct and improper exclusion of evidence in criminal cases?</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the hearing the court verified Gbagbo's identity and ensured that he was informed of the four charges against him, including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during last year's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Ivory Coast. He was also advised of his rights under the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] of the ICC. Another hearing is to be held to confirm whether there is sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable belief that the allegations may in fact be true and that Gbagbo committed these crimes. If the court determines that evidence presented is satisfactory to confirm the charges, then the matter will proceed to trial.

<p>Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">taken into ICC custody</a> [JURIST report] last week. National authorities arrested Gbagbo the day before, and he was brought to the Netherlands in response to a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">warrant of arrest</a> [text, PDF] that was issued by the ICC judges the week before. Gbagbo is accused as an indirect co-perpetrator during the last year's post-election violence that arose when he refused to step down from office despite his defeat by the current president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile]. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] in April but only after a six-month conflict that reportedly resulted in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/cdi1011WebUpload.pdf">death of at least 3,000 civilians</a> [HRW report, PDF] and rape of more than 150 women. The investigation was set in motion after the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-to-open-ivory-coast-war-crimes-probe.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution's request to look into the crimes in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A judge in October <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Rajaratnam to 11 years in prison, fined him $10 million and ordered he forfeit an additional $53.8 million. The 11-year sentence was significantly lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the 19 1/2-year minimum indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Even so, Rajaratnam's sentence is the longest term ever imposed for insider trading and is part of a trend of tougher sentences for white-collar criminals precipitated in part by the federal sentencing guidelines which Congress passed in 1987. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence. 

<p>Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted of 14 counts of insider trading</a> [JURIST report] in May in the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">six months in prison</a> in September and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">after pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 after being indicted for insider trading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/">Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/australia-senate-passes-law-banning-cigarette-brand-labels.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011B00128">Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill</a> [text], which removes descriptive colors and logos from cigarette boxes and requires a depiction of the negative effects of smoking. Imperial argues that the law violates the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/">Australian Constitution</a> [materials] because it allows the government to <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/12/06/us-australia-smoking-idINTRE7B507R20111206">take the intellectual property of private companies</a> [Reuters report] without compensation. Tobacco companies challenging the law also maintain that the law will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/imperial-tobacco-becomes-2nd-company-to-challenge-packaging-laws-in-australian-high-court/2011/12/06/gIQAO29MYO_story.html">dramatically decrease the value of their brands</a> [AP report]. The Australian government has indicated that they expected challenges to the law, but ultimately believe the law will be allowed to go into effect. The law is currently scheduled to go into effect on December 1, 2012. 

<p>Last week, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/tobacco-company-challenges-new-Australia-cigarette-packaging-law.php">similar lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] with the High Court by <a href="http://www.bat.com/">British American Tobacco</a> (BAT) [corporate website]. BAT argued that the new law would flood the black market with fake cigarettes and that the taxpayers would lose out on billions of dollars as a result of lost excise taxes. The High Court could decide to hear the BAT and Imperial cases together. In November, <a href="http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_hk.aspx">Philip Morris Asia Ltd.</a> (PMA) [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">initiated legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of its Australian subsidiary <a href="http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_au.aspx">Philip Morris Ltd.</a> [corporate website]. One hour after the legislation passed, PMA, a Hong Kong based company, filed a Notice of Arbitration under Australia's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.hk/IPPAAustraliae.PDF">Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong</a> [text, PDF], arguing that the law violates the trade deal between Australia and Hong Kong. PMA has also <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9R4VTKG0.htm">threatened further litigation</a> [AP report] related to the law. Tobacco export countries including Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Ukraine have also indicated that they may challenge the law as a violation of global trade rules.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11688&LangID=E">condemned all Yemeni factions</a> [press release] after claiming that as many as 22 people have been killed in the city of Taiz by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/2011122111944508927.html">shootings and shellings</a> [Al Jazeera report] since December 1, including two children. Despite tanks withdrawing from the city under a ceasefire pact to end violence that has consumed the country for nearly 10 months, witnesses and activists have claimed that forces loyal to former Yemeni president <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%5C%22Ali+Abdullah+Saleh%5C%22">news archive</a>] shot and killed a woman protester in Taiz just this week. Shamdasani added that the ongoing severity of the clashes between armed rebels and the Yemeni army warrant an immediate intervention by the OHCHR, and she called on Yemeni government officials to allow a UN investigation as soon as possible. The Yemeni government has yet to issue a response.

<p>Yemen has been faced with calls for human rights investigations consistently throughout its government's transition. Last week, Nobel peace laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15216473">Tawakkul Karman</a> [BBC profile; Nobel <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/karman.html">profile</a>] urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nobel-peace-laureate-tawakkul-karman.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] Saleh's violent crackdown on dissent and alleged human rights violations while in power. In September, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-security-council-urges-end-to-yemen-violence.php">called on Yemen to comply with international law</a> [JURIST report] and end ongoing violence against protesters that resulted in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119254238529145.html">deaths of at least 49 people</a> [Al Jazeera report] shortly following Saleh's return as president after a three-month absence. The OHCHR has also previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-calls-for-immediate-intervention-in-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.php">urged a UN intervention</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen after verifying that the Yemeni government was indeed firing on peaceful protesters. Saleh clung to the presidency throughout nearly 10 months of protests and violence despite <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreeing to step down</a> [JURIST report] in April, shortly following his attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand his political authority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.org%2Fen%2Flibrary%2Fasset%2FASA01%2F023%2F2011%2Fen%2F103678e4-fa6f-4b1c-86a9-7d94e42b9494%2Fasa010232011en.pdf&ei=uzveTomUMKry0gGrvYnPBw&usg=AFQjCNEZKY3trp5gWBETWhWv1htyV05tEQ">When Justice Fails: Thousands Executed in Asia After Unfair Trials</a> [text, PDF], argues that these countries' legal systems fail to meet international standards, such as torture, mandatory death sentences, presumed guilt, right to counsel and other factors that contribute to unjust trials and convictions. The report also examines case studies from individuals facing trials in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. It states:<blockquote>In compiling this report, a number of cases have been reviewed which clearly demonstrate that who will be executed and who will be spared is often determined not only by the nature of the crimes but also the defendants' ethnic or other identity, their economic or social status, or their ability to understand and navigate through the trial process, the availability or adequacy of legal aid and defence counsel, and other factors that determine whether they are able to challenge unfairness in a criminal justice system that propels them towards death.</blockquote>ADPAN's goal is abolition of the death penalty, as it says "only abolition ... can guarantee that no innocent person will be executed." For countries that refuse to abolish it, the group advocates that they at least comply with international standards for fair trials that do not violate human rights.

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a report saying the number of <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">countries using the death penalty is decreasing</a> [JURIST report]. At that time, though, Asia still had the highest number of executions, executing more people than the rest of the world combined. ADPAN has been working since 2006 to achieve abolition of the death penalty in all Asia-Pacific countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo said that he is in the process of requesting information from DRC authorities and that he would investigate allegations of violence by government security forces as well as armed political groups. He emphasized that he will not depart from his November <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecuter-drc-must-avoid-election-violence.php">commitment to prosecute election violence</a> [JURIST report]. Moreno-Ocampo warned political leaders of the consequences of continued violence:<blockquote>Leaders from all sides must understand this: my Office is watching the situation in the DRC very closely. As we have shown in both Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire, planning and executing attacks on civilians for electoral gain will not be tolerated. This Court can investigate and prosecute you if you are responsible for committing ICC crimes, irrespective of position, and irrespective of political affiliation. I urge leaders, commanders, and politicians on all sides to calm your supporters. Electoral violence is no longer a ticket to power, I assure you. It is a ticket to The Hague.</blockquote>Moreno-Ocampo noted that he welcomed the investigation of violence by national authorities in the DRC and that his office would continue to monitor these efforts. 

<p>The DRC has faced significant international pressure to ensure fair elections and prevent election violence. Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hrw-urges-drc-government-to-end-post-election-violence.php">urged the DRC government to prevent violence</a> [JURIST report] after a report found that 18 civilians had been killed and about 100 seriously wounded during unrest following the presidential elections on November 28. Also last week, top UN officials with the <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=932">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (MONUSCO) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-officials-deplore-post-election-violence-in-drc-call-for-restraint.php">decried</a> [JURIST report] post-election violence in the DRC and called for restraint. MONUSCO urged all parties to remain calm and await the decision of the seven-member Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) on the preliminary results of the elections. Last month, Moreno-Ocampo said his office would prosecute individuals involved election violence in the DRC. The chief prosecutor's warning came just days after the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Joint Human Rights Office</a> (UNJHRO) [official website] on urged the DRC government to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/drc-urged-to-prevent-rights-violations-linked-to-electoral-process.php">take action to abolish election-related violence</a> [JURIST report] before the presidential election on November 28.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/mali1211_forinsertWebUpload_0.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday. Children reportedly carry heavy ore from the mining shafts and are exposed to mercury inhalation, which causes severe health problems. The gold mined by Malian children as young as six years old is then exported through the international stream of commerce with Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates as the industry's two major purchasers. Although Mali's government adopted a National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labor in June 2011, HRW says the plan has not been adequately enforced. HRW reports that there is no regulation or inspection of the mines, even though under both Malian and international law hazardous labor is prohibited for children under the age of 18. Furthermore, the Mali government has allegedly failed to provide education for the children working in mines, and those who do attend school struggle academically. Most of the children work in the mines with their parents to supplement the family income. However, children who work alone in the mines are sometimes exploited and abused by relatives or other people who take their pay and some girls are sexually abused. The report calls on all governments to:<blockquote>support a strong international legally binding instrument on mercury that requires governments to implement mandatory action plans for mercury reduction in artisanal gold mining. The action plans should include strategies to end the use of mercury by children and pregnant women working in mining, and public health strategies to address the health effects of mercury poisoning.</blockquote>HRW urged the Mali government and international donors to take actions to end the dangerous practice of child labor in Mali's gold mines.

<p>In November, HRW reported that Chinese copper mining companies in Zambia <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/china-mining-companies-in-zambia-violating-labor-laws-hrw.php">routinely violate national and international labor standards</a> [JURIST report]. The report described poor health and safety standards, regular 12-hour and 18-hour work shifts and anti-union activity. Workers also reportedly face the threat of being fired if they refuse to work under unsafe conditions. Although not reported to the government, injuries and health standards are in violation of Zambian and international labor law. In October, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ninth-circuit-allows-papua-new-guineans-to-sue-mining-company-for-genocide.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1246074.stm">Papua New Guinea</a> [BBC backgrounder] citizens against mining company <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> [corporate website] on claims of genocide and war crimes. Allowing the suit under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text], the court ruled that it may proceed due to the Australian mining company's substantial operations in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Commission is also examining the character and terms of the agency agreements entered into by the above named five publishers and retailers for the sale of e-books. The Commission has concerns, that these practices may breach EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E101:EN:HTML">Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> - TFEU) [text].</blockquote>The Commission assured that the investigation is not a prejudgement of the outcome.

<p>Apple has recently been involved with a number of legal disputes, including a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] dealing with the same matter. The class action lawsuit claims that Apple's conduct constitutes violations of federal and state antitrust laws, including the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/3400/">Cartwright Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=17001-18000&file=17200-17210">Unfair Competition Act</a> [texts]. In July, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-htc.php">prevailed in a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=6">HTC</a> [corporate website] when the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">ruled against HTC</a> [JURIST report] for infringement of patents related to cell phones that run the Android operating system (OS). Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">filed a complaint against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month in an effort to bar importation of Samsung's smartphones and tablets. Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. Apple is also involved in two other suits with Samsung dealing with patent infringements, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">one in the U.S.</a> {JURIST report] and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/samsung-sues-apple-in-london-following-u-s-iphone-ipad-patent-lawsuit.html">one in London</a> [Bloomberg report]. In June, Nokia announced that it had <a href="http://press.nokia.com/2011/06/14/nokia-enters-into-patent-license-agreement-with-apple/">reached an agreement with apple</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/apple-to-pay-nokia-royalties-in-settlement-of-patent-disputes.php">report</a>] settling all patent disputes between the parties and directing Apple to pay royalties to Nokia for the term of the agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report noted that the vote count was assessed was "bad or very bad" in 34 of 115 observed polling stations, voting counts were interrupted and taken out of the view of monitors, there were indications of ballot stuffing in 17 polling stations, vote counting errors were noted in 35 polling stations and in several instances election observers were not shown marked ballots of expelled from the polling station during the counting process. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://video.state.gov/en/video/1310992985001">called for an investigation</a> [press conference, video; <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2011/12/178290.htm#RUSSIA">transcript</a>] into the allegations of election fraud and expressed concern over <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/europe/russia-puts-pressure-on-elections-monitor-golos.html">"harassment"</a> [NYT report] of election monitoring groups, such as <a href="www.golos.org/news/en">Golos</a> [advocacy website]. In addition to evidence of ballot stuffing found by OSCE, there have also been indications of <a href="http://observers.france24.com/content/20111206-russia-election-fraud-caught-video-ballot-stuffing-erasable-ink-putin-protests">other voting fraud</a> [The Observers report] including erasable ink pens being given to voters, ballots being falsified, "carousel" voting where one individual votes at multiple polling centers and unsealed ballot boxes. Despite the alleged voting fraud, the ruling <a href="http://er.ru/">United Russia</a> [party website, in Russian] party of Russian <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] lost 77 seats in the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], Russia's parliament, barely maintaining its majority.

<p>There were allegations of voting fraud in both the 2007 and 2008 Russia elections as well. In 2008 the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a> (PACE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/russia-presidential-election-observers.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Russia's presidential elections due to alleged media restrictions and polling irregularities.

Election observers from PACE and OSCE said the parliamentary elections were <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/fraud-claims-cloud-putin-party-win-in.php">"not held on a level playing field"</a> [JURIST report] due to strong media bias towards Putin and the United Russia party leading up to the election, widespread reports of harassment of opposition parties and a new election code that made it more difficult for smaller political parties go gain the seven percent of the vote necessary to serve on the State Duma.

The report argues that the government has failed to protect lesbians and transgender men under the <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/96cons2.htm#9">"equality clause"</a> [text] of the South African Bill of Rights. The report recommends that government publicly denounce gender-based violence, increase awareness of the Bill of Rights' equality clause and policies of nondiscrimination and decrease barriers to prosecuting cases of sexual and physical violence based on gender orientation:<blockquote>South Africa already has in place many laws and policies to address sexual violence and discrimination; what is sorely lacking is effective implementation of those provisions. It is incumbent upon the South African government to take immediate steps to honor its promise of equality, non-discrimination, and a life of dignity for lesbians, gay men, and bisexual and transgender people; failing to do so betrays the constitution, imperiling the rights of all South Africans.</blockquote>HRW also urged the UN and African Union to support South Africa's efforts and to ensure the country meets its obligations under international law.

<p>In June South Africa introduced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [JURIST report] which was passed by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. South Africa was the only African nation to vote for the passage of the resolution. The UN has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues, due to no international consensus on the morality of homosexuality. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. Two years ago, the UN passed a <A href = "http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/491-1.pdf">gay rights declaration</a> [text, PDF], which the <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">US signed and sponsored</a> [JURIST report]. The declaration, a nonbinding measure that does not have the full force of a resolution, called on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href = "http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. The year before, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement. As of the 2011 <a href = "http://ilga.org">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-8505.pdf">Williams v. Illinois</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-hear-another-confrontation-clause-case-on-admissibility-of-lab-tests.php">report</a>], the justices heard the latest in a series of arguments over the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause</a> [text] and will decide if a defendant's rights are violated if the state permits an expert witness to testify about the results of a DNA test performed at a private laboratory, when the analysts who performed the tests do not testify, and the expert witness has not had an opportunity to confront the actual analysts. The attorney for Sandra Williams, whose conviction was upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court, argued that without anyone from the lab present to testify about the DNA results, his rights were violated, especially since the lab tests themselves were not entered into evidence. Williams' counsel further argued that there is not an exception in the held understanding that experts may testify using whatever background material that furthers their expert opinion, and claimed that the DNA test was testified to for its ultimate truthfulness, not to aid the expert's knowledge.<blockquote>Now this&#8212;I can give an example or an analogy. Suppose a police officer were to testify: A witness gave me this photograph and told me: This is a photograph of the offender. I compared this photograph to a photograph of the defendant. I found that they match. Now, the police officer, he compared the photographs. You know, we are not contesting [the testifying analyst's] match. But the statement that this is the photo of the offender, that's not the officer's statement. That's a statement of the witness who gave him that photograph.</blockquote>Counsel for the state of Illinois argued that the Confrontation Clause does not apply in this scenario: "an expert can always testify about the material that they relied on, whether that material is ever admitted into evidence and sometimes that material could never be admitted into evidence." In support of Illinois' position, the US government argued that there can be no Confrontation Clause-issue, because the analyst who testified had to explain her lack of hands-on experience with the test. Although an analyst from the lab would make the state's case stronger, as the witness they presented does not have firsthand experience with the lab or its procedures, the Confrontation Clause does not obligate the state to present the strongest case possible.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1265.pdf">Martel v. Clair</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court will determine whether a condemned state prisoner in federal <em>habeas corpus</em> proceedings is entitled to replace his court-appointed counsel with another court-appointed lawyer because he expresses dissatisfaction and alleges that his counsel was failing to pursue potentially important evidence. The attorney the state of California, argued that due to numerous safeguards and procedural rulings on the effectiveness of Clair's counsel, the state had done due diligence in protecting his rights and did not have an obligation to grant him new counsel after 12 years of proceedings. The attorney for Clair disagreed and argued that Clair did not have a right to new counsel, merely a right to a thorough investigation of his current counsel, which he was denied.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senators <a href = "http://durbin.senate.gov/public/">Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL) and <A HREF = "http://www.grassley.senate.gov/">Chuck Grassley</a> (R-IA) [official websites] submitted the <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.01945:">Cameras in the Courtroom Act of 2011</a> [S 1945 materials] bill on Monday, which would "permit television coverage of all open sessions of the Court unless the Court decides, by a vote of the majority of justices, that allowing such coverage in a particular case would constitute a violation of the due process rights of 1 or more of the parties before the Court." Several witnesses opined on the validity of this idea, including former judiciary committee member <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arlen+specter">Arlen Specter</a> [JURIST news archive], a longtime proponent for the admittance of cameras. In his pre-hearing, <a href = "http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/11-12-6SpecterTestimony.pdf">published testimony</a> [text, PDF], he argued the educational necessity of televising proceedings:<blockquote>The average man on the street does not understand the intricacies of Supreme Court opinions, but does have the sense that something is amiss when there are so many 5-4 decisions. People think the law is objectively determinable and does not depend upon the individual judges' personal predilections. So the common sense question arises as to whether the Court is really stating the law when there are so many split decisions. When people are told that there are ideological splits, it is even more distressing.  Frequent opinion polls show the public has little understanding of the Constitution or how government works. As we strive for an educated citizenry, especially among the younger generation, television should cover the government as well as sports and soaps. The authority and legitimacy of the Supreme Court depends upon its acceptance by the public. Television would give the public the opportunity to understand and evaluate the Court's performance and the Court and opportunity to establish its legitimacy.</blockquote>Attorney Thomas Goldstein, in his <a href = "http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/11-12-6GoldsteinTestimony.pdf">remarks</a> [text, PDF] argued that it is constitutionally valid to require the Supreme Court to televise proceedings, stating that although there is no explicit <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] right to televising the proceedings, there is an implicit right to access to government materials. Goldstein also insisted the greatest issue with the idea lies in media exposure: "Here as in so many contexts, the fault lies with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. The Justices would be right to predict that excerpts of questions or opinion announcements will be taken out of context and mocked in some instances." Attorney Maureen Mahoney <a href = "http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/11-12-6MahoneyTestimony.pdf">argued against this understanding</a> [text, PDF] of the Constitution, stating that separation of powers and historical treatment of the Supreme Court by the legislature forbids mandating them to change their practices.

<p>The current Supreme Court roster has varying opinions on allowing cameras into their proceedings. In September, Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer <a href = "http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=8bbe59e76fc0b6747b22c32c9e014187">testified</a> [hearing materials] before the Judiciary Committee on a variety of issues, including televising their arguments and opinion announcements. Both were against the idea, arguing that it would not be used by the populace for anything worthwhile. Scalia was concerned with the ability of the media to misrepresent the court: "I was initially in favor of televising, but the longer I've been there, the less good idea I think it is. [F]or every 10 people who sat through our proceedings gavel to gavel, there would be 10,000 people who would see nothing but a 30-second takeout from one of the proceedings, which I guarantee you would not be representative of what we do." In contrast, Justice Elena Kagan has spoken out <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztpLPOluTUc">for the introduction of cameras</a> [CSPAN interview video]: "[I]f everybody could see this, it would make people feel so good about this branch of government and how it's operating and I thought, it's such a shame actually that only 200 people a day can get to see it and then a bunch of other people can read about it. Because reading about it is not the same experience as actually seeing." Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito were both for televising proceedings in their tenure as lower court judges. Sotomayor continues to warm to the idea, while Alito, in his confirmation hearings, urged that the Supreme Court faces different considerations than lower courts. The other justices, to varying degrees, have <a href = "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/what-do-the-supreme-court-justices-think-of-cameras-in-court/">seemed wary of the idea</a> [ABC News report], Chief Justice John Roberts speculating that it would encourage grandstanding and reduce substantive discussion. Former justice David Souter was <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/30/us/on-cameras-in-supreme-court-souter-says-over-my-dead-body.html">against cameras</a> [NYT report], saying in 1996, "I think the case is so strong that I can tell you the day you see a camera come into our courtroom, it's going to roll over my dead body."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers representing Mubarak's alleged victims filed the petition, claiming that presiding Judge Ahmed Refaat <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/December/middleeast_December174.xml&section=middleeast&col=">showed bias in favor of Mubarak</a> [AFP report] and overlooked proper courtroom procedure. Due to the closed-session, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-s-military-ruler-testifies-in-mubarak-trial-1.386511">nothing has been revealed about the testimony</a> [AP report], nor how the lawyers' actions stem from it.

<p>Mubarak's trial is scheduled to resume on December 28, after being <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] in October to allow the court to rule on the prosecution's motion to removed the three-judge panel. The victims' families argued they were <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/2011103011331929580.html">not given enough time</a> [Al Jazeera report] to question Field Marshal <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/tantawi.htm">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], head of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] ruling Egypt.

Strange sent a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jWzaSqrbKGCNQMCdRAaOhZF7zwbA?docId=d96c1bdc35914c68af848f9f9de2c177">letter to leaders of the Alabama legislature</a> [AP report] suggesting the removal of at least two of the sections that are currently on hold as a result of a federal court order. The sections Strange recommended for removal are one which criminalizes the failure of illegal immigrants to carry registration documents and another that requires public schools to collect information regarding the immigration status of their students. Both of these provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in an October ruling of the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Strange's letter was in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/06/us/alabama-immigration-law/index.html">response to a request</a> [CNN report] by Alabama Senate President Pro Tempore <a href="http://www.alprotem.com/">Del Marsh</a> [official website], who had stated earlier that the legislature would only consider changes that were recommended by the attorney general. According to Strange, the proposed changes would allow the law to be more easily defended in court, make implementation easier for law enforcement, and remove certain burdens of compliance on law abiding citizens.

<p>The immigration law has faced numerous challenges in court since it took effect in September. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] in the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit urging the court to strike down the law. The DOJ filed its brief in response to a federal judge's <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66701706/Summary-Opinion-on-Alabama-Immigration-Law">September 28 ruling</a> [opinion text] that allowed the state to enforce a provision that makes it a felony for an illegal alien to conduct business with the state, among other provisions. The DOJ argued in its brief that the Alabama immigration laws are preempted by federal laws regulating immigration in the US because of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in the US Constitution. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a separate brief also asking the court to overturn the new law. The ACLU's brief argued that the laws are designed to make life in Alabama so difficult for illegal aliens that they will be <a href="/forum/2011/11/kevin-johnson-alabama-immigration.php">forced to leave the state</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Like the DOJ, the ACLU argued that Alabama's law is a direct attempt to regulate immigration, which is an area that the states have no legitimate interest in regulating and is left only to the federal government to legislate. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Court papers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/business/bank-of-americas-merrill-unit-in-mortgage-settlement.html">disclosing the settlement agreement</a> [AP report] were filed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. The claims were a part of a class action lawsuit led by the pension fund of the <a href="http://www.pers.state.ms.us/index.cfm">Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi</a> [official website], which alleged that BOA's Merrill Lynch unit provided the fund with misinformation regarding the risks of the mortgage-backed investments it made prior to the financial crisis. The settlement agreement now requires the approval of federal Judge Jed Rakoff, who recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-citigroup-sec-settlement.php">rejected a $285 million settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] and <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup Inc</a> [corporate website], after deciding that SEC did not put any effort into finding out what Citigroup did wrong.

<p>This settlement agreement by BOA is the latest attempt by the corporation to move past legal issues that have plagued it in recent years. Last month, a senior judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] gave <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-gives-final-approval-to-bank-of-america-overdraft-fee-settlement.php">final approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $410 million settlement in the class action suit against BOA for overdraft fees that affected more than 13 million people. Judge James Lawrence King found this agreement to be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-oks-410m-settlement-bank-america-14900014">fair and reasonable</a> [AP report] even though customers will not be fully compensated for overdraft fees which averaged approximately $35 per transaction. Approximately 13.2 million customers who had a debit card with BOA between January 2001 and May 2011 will have money credited to their account or will receive checks from BOA as a result of this settlement. The settlement with BOA, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/bank-of-america-settles-excessive-overdraft-fee-lawsuit.php">reached in February</a>, was given <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bank-of-america-gains-preliminary-approval-of-class-action-settlement-for-illegal-overdraft-fees.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST reports] in May. BOA is among more than two dozen US, Canadian and European lenders named as defendants in the class action lawsuit, which consolidated claims across the country in 2009. In their <a href="http://www.bank-overdraft.com/pdf/20091102-bofa-complaint.pdf">amended complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plaintiffs claimed that BOA's practices were deceptive in that they did not reasonably notify customers that they had the option of opting out of the overdraft scheme and declining transactions. The complaint also alleged that BOA's excessive fees disproportionately effect low-income customers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/files/billindex/pdf/2011/DR422011E.pdf">Peaceful Assembly Act 2011</a> [bill, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/malaysia-lawmakers-advance-ban-on-street-protests.php">passed the lower house</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/index.php?modload=sites&action=innerpage&id=5&view=23&uweb=p&lang=en">Parliament</a> [official website] last week, would limit free speech rights by forbidding Malaysian citizens under the age of 21 and non-citizens from assembling, enacting conditional access for media to public gatherings and outlawing street protests altogether. Those who violate the new law may be penalized with thousands of dollars in fines. The UN Special Rapporteur on free expression urged Malaysia's government not to adopt the bill, calling the right to peaceably assemble "a litmus test for the level of democracy in any country." The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants noted that prohibiting non-citizens from assembling also violates international law, under which "everyone" has the right to freedom of assembly and association, without distinction of any kind. Last week approximately 500 lawyers marched on Parliament in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur in protest of the bill's ban on street protests. Numerous rights groups reportedly plan to challenge the law in court.

<p>In November Malaysian <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-najib-razak/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/malaysia-introduces-stricter-regulations-on-protests.php"> defended the bill</a> [JURIST report], saying it would balance citizens' right to protest with public safety concerns. However, the bill has drawn ire from both Malaysians and the international community. Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] has stated that the bill is more draconian than previous free speech crackdowns in <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/zimbabwe-police-ban-political-rallies.php">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/myanmar-president-approves-peaceful-protest-bill.php">Myanmar</a> [JURIST reports]. In late October the Malaysian <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/?q=en/node/593">Court of Appeal</a> [official website] ruled that a similar law prohibiting college students from taking part in political activities is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-court-strikes-down-ban-on-student-political-activity.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The suit, filed by four <a href="http://www.iium.edu.my/">International Islamic University of Malaysia</a> [official website] students in 2010, challenged the constitutionality of the 1971 <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%201/Act%2030.pdf">Universities and University Colleges Act</a> (UUCA) [text, PDF] prohibiting students from political participation. Also last month, Malaysia's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-releases-125-prisoners-in-plan-to-repeal-strict-security-law.php">released 125 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who were being held under a decades-old security law that has been widely criticized by human rights and opposition groups. In September, Razak announced that the government would repeal <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">two strict security laws</a> [JURIST report] that had allowed extended detention of suspects without trial. The government also said that it will review other laws dealing with freedom of the press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of the bill, including Brazil's <a href="http://www.ictsdclimate.org/en/events/organisers/agriculture-and-livestock-confederation-of-brazil-cna">National Agriculture and Livestock Federation</a> [official website], say that this change will assist in lowering the carbon emissions while continuing to require farmers and ranchers to preserve significant amount of forest. On the other hand, critics of the new bill, such as the <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF) [advocacy website] <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?202721">argue</a> [press release], that the new bill will create extended amnesty for those who cut down the forest illegally and promote the continuance of such practice. The amended legislation will now return to the lower house, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/brazil-lower-house-passes-reforms-easing-restrictions-on-deforestation.php">approved an earlier version</a> [JURIST report] in May, and then to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [BBC profile]. It remains to be seen how these changes to Brazil's Forest Code will affect deforestation and the global climate.

<p>Currently, the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/durban_nov_2011/meeting/6245.php">UN Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] is taking place in Durban to focus on the threat of climate change. Weeks before the conference, the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/#">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/UN-panel-releases-summary-on-risk-management-in-face-of-increased-environmental-disasters.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPM_Approved-HiRes_opt.pdf">Summary for Policymakers</a> [text, PDF], which outlined available options to decrease risks posed by extreme disasters including effects arising out of increased greenhouse gases. In July, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] made its <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/security-council-declares-global-warming-threat-to-international-security.php">first official statement</a> [JURIST report] that the climate change is most likely to pose a serious threat to world peace and security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The non-binding resolution was backed by a show of hands and is expected to be followed by a bill. Prostitution is not currently outlawed in France although certain linked activities are. France's sex worker's trade union, <a href="http://site.strass-syndicat.org/">STRASS</a> [advocacy website, in French], opposes the proposed bill, claiming that it would further repress sex workers by endangering their health, livelihood and safety.  However, French-led men's initiative <a href="http://www.zeromacho.eu/anglais.html">ZeroMacho</a> [advocacy website] approved of the attempt to criminalize prostitution. A vote on the bill is expected in the coming days. 

<p>Other countries have also attempted to outlaw portions of the prostitution trade. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> (OSCJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Canada's anti-prostitution laws, citing the danger they generate for sex workers. In Canada, prostitution itself is legal even though many ancillary acts are not. In March, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] agreed to review a <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">British Columbia Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/canada-high-court-to-review-anti-prostitution-laws.php">allowing a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the country's anti-prostitution laws. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, Taiwanese] of Taiwan ruled that a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/taiwan-high-court-rules-prostitution.php">law penalizing prostitutes</a> [JURIST report] and not their clients was unconstitutional because it undermined equality under the country's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result of the decision, Abu-Jamal will remain in prison for life ending a 30-year sentencing battle after he was convicted of killing police officer Daniel Faulkner. Williams said the decision was made after consultation with Faulkner's family and rests on the premise that continuing to seek the death penalty would open the case to an "unknowable number of years" of appeals. The decision was applauded by supporters on both sides. Abu-Jamal's recent legal representative, Widener University law professor <a href="http://law.widener.edu/Academics/Faculty/ProfilesDe/RitterJudithL.aspx">Judith Ritter</a> [academic profile] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h8havjXTiK43TjdWSUSm4taWZCQw?docId=e5fddd7e67b64309b8b1bc598bf6720d">welcomed the decision</a> [AP report].

<p>The conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-grants-new-sentencing-for-mumia.php">new sentencing hearing was granted</a> [JURIST report] in April on the basis of improper jury instructions. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] declined to opine on the decision in October, which forced prosecutors to decide whether they would pursue the death penalty through a new sentencing hearing. The Supreme Court had considered Abu-Jamal's case in several previous rulings. The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-remands-mumia-case-to.php">remanded the case to the Third Circuit</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010 for further consideration in light of the ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-724.pdf">Smith v. Spisak</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-reverses-sixth-circuit-in.php">report</a>]. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-declines-to-review-mumia.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] Abu-Jamal's conviction in April 2009. In 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-backs-new.php">Third Circuit affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a district court ruling overturning the sentence in Abu-Jamal's case, and the only issue to be determined on remand was whether the court erred in allowing the new sentencing hearing. Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing police officer <a href="http://justice.danielfaulkner.com/">Daniel Faulkner</a> [advocacy website] after Faulkner pulled over Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. The case has become a focal point for death penalty opponents and <a href="http://www.freemumia.com/">Abu-Jamal's supporters</a> [advocacy website] who believe he was the victim of a racially biased justice system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The secretary's remarks before the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in Geneva were in tandem with an executive <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/06/presidential-memorandum-international-initiatives-advance-human-rights-l">memo</a> [text] from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] directing federal agencies to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/06/MNDL1M97DK.DTL&type=gaylesbian">investigate avenues to combat criminalization of homosexuality</a> [SFC report] and to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16062937">consider gay rights in aid and asylum decisions</a> [BBC report]. In conjunction with International Human Rights Day, the secretary explained:<blockquote>Some have suggested that gay rights and human rights are separate and distinct; but, in fact, they are one and the same. ... Yet in the past 60 years, we have come to recognize that members of these groups are entitled to the full measure of dignity and rights, because, like all people, they share a common humanity. ... Like being a woman, like being a racial, religious, tribal, or ethnic minority, being LGBT does not make you less human. And that is why gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.</blockquote>The immediate implications are unclear as several current aid recipients have laws criminalizing homosexuality.  

<p>As Clinton noted, gay rights have not been universally acknowledged. Last week, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill making it <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nigeria-senate-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">illegal for same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST report] or for an individual to aid in the marriage of same-sex couples. The bill explicitly states that marriages entered into by persons of the same gender are prohibited and will not be recognized as valid, even if the marriage certificate is obtained in a foreign country. Last month, Russian lawmakers in the city of St. Petersburg overwhelmingly approved an initial reading of a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">impose fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality</a> [JURIST report], including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The legislation, which was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iN30TwwunCPBtqr3Pnt0fxHgrRaQ?docId=CNG.4a103f4c12c31f010418ccb1595560e0.371">supported by the ruling United Russia party</a> [AFP report], would ban gay pride parades and any activity in public which could influence children and that could be viewed as promoting a gay, lesbian, transgender or LGBT lifestyle. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/cases/UGHC/">Ugandan High Court</a> [official website] sentenced a man to 30 years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">beating to death prominent gay rights activist</a> [JURIST report] David Kato.

Before Gordon's sentence was announced, he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/08/us-thailand-lesemajeste-idUSTRE7B707U20111208?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FworldNews+(News+%2F+US+%2F+International)">reiterated his American citizenship</a> [Reuters report] and discredited the Thai judicial system. The Thai law states "whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir to the throne or the Regent shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years."  While Gordon's lawyer Arnon Nampa has stated he does not plan to appeal, Gordon will request royal pardon to excuse his sentence.  

<p>UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Frank La Rue</a> [official website] recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-condemns-thailand-royal-insult-law.php">condemned the law</a> [JURIST report]. La Rue also condemned the country's 2007 <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/117">Computer Crimes Act</a> [unofficial text], which imposes a prison sentence of up to five years for any views expressed on the Internet in relation to the monarchy deemed to be a threat to national security.  The act is used to further enforce the country's insult law, La Rue said, "[t]he threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression. ... This is exacerbated by the fact that the charges can be brought by private individuals and trials are often closed to the public." In 2009,<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/"> Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-condemns-closed-thailand.php">public trial</a> [JURIST report] for a Thai political activist accused of lese majeste, or insulting the royal family. Judge Prommat Toosang <a href="http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/1261">ordered</a> [Reuters report] that the trial of <a href="http://thaipoliticalprisoners.wordpress.com/decidedcases/darunee-charnchoensilpakul/">Darunee Charnchoengsilpakul</a> [advocacy website] be closed for national security reasons. AI's Asia-Pacific director Sam Zarifi noted that although the closure of trials is legitimate under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Thai Constitution, the government "will have a very difficult time explaining why the trial of someone charged with making an insulting remark could compromise Thailand's national security." Zafiri said that Prommat's guarantee of a fair trial was inadequate and "simply not verifiable" unless the trial is conducted in public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 54-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/yemen1211ForUpload_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] titled "How Come You Allow Little Girls to Get Married?" HRW claims that the current laws effectively make Yemeni girls and women second class citizens, often forcing them into pre-arranged child marriages where they will have no control over decisions such as when to bear children. More than half of Yemeni women report having entered into marriage before 18 years of age. The report claims that raising the marital age to 18 will increase girls' educational opportunities and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilgC5zJhzkyOxUrsJIV5K4Q6AH8A?docId=bc42b6de22f540b3994ea637934c5673">protect their human rights</a> [AP report]. HRW made several recommendations to the Yemeni government:<blockquote>To the Government of Yemen:

<ul>
	<li>Set the minimum age for marriage at 18 in accordance with the definition of a child in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</li>
	<li>Raise awareness with religious leaders about the harmful health consequences of child marriage on the lives of girls and women.</li>
	<li>Increase and improve access to reproductive health services and information for all girls and women, including access to emergency obstetric care and family planning.</li>
	<li>Develop retention strategies to ensure that girls who enroll in school are able to remain in school, such as financial  incentives for families to keep girls in school and to subsidize the costs  of uniforms and textbooks.</li>
	<li>Raise awareness about the obligation to register births and marriages through the media. </li>
</ul></blockquote>A majority of Yemenis, including 83.4 percent of Yemeni women, would reportedly <a href="http://yemenpolling.com/y/news.php?newsid=29&lng=en">support fixing the marital age at 18 years old</a> [Yemen Polling Center]. Despite denying a 2009 bill that <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/node/436/">proposed fixing the minimum marital age at 17</a> [Equality Now report], Yemen ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2008. 

<p>Yemen has been repeatedly criticized for various human rights abuses in the past. In September, a delegation from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/YE/YemenAssessmentMissionReport.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] announcing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-calls-for-immediate-intervention-in-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.php">humanitarian crisis</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen that requires immediate intervention. The OHCHR verified that the Yemeni government was firing on peaceful protesters as well as warring against armed rebels, and that as a tactic of war, both sides were withholding water, fuel and electricity from civilians. The report also listed a number of human rights atrocities, including the government shooting at ambulances and preventing activists from receiving medical treatment, utilizing child soldiers, and illegally detaining, torturing and killing an inestimable number of adults and children. The report ended with a plea to both the armed rebels and the government of Yemen to end the violence and called on the international community to condemn Yemen's action and provide humanitarian and financial relief to the nation. Yemen has also been <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">criticized</a> [AI report] for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. </p>]]></content:encoded>

This year saw the arrests of the last two remaining fugitives wanted by the ICTY, meaning none of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/sections/TheCases/KeyFigures">161 persons indicted by the tribunal</a> [materials] remain at large, but nine fugitives sought by ICTR have continued to escape capture, three of whom are among the most high-ranking of the accused. ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow called on the Member States of the Great Lakes Conference to provide information and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40658&Cr=Criminal+tribunal&Cr1=">aid in the apprehension of the remaining fugitives</a> [UN News Centre report], as the trial work of the ICTR is due to be finished by the end of the second quarter of 2012, with appeals work finished by early 2014. ICTY Prosecutor Serge Brammertz <a href="http://icty.org/sid/10872">observed</a> [ICTY press release] that the capture of the remaining ICTY fugitives means that tribunal is now fully occupied with finishing its trials and appeals in fulfillment of its completion strategy, but expressed concern over statements by high-level Croatian authorities that question the validity of the ICTY's work. On the other hand he noted that day-to-day cooperation with his office is proceeding well in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presidents of the ICTR and ICTY, Judge Khalida Rachid Khan and <a href="http://icty.org/sid/10873">Judge Theodor Meron</a> [ICTY press release], also addressed the 15-member Security Council on the work of their respective courts.

<p>Last month the two presidents told the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] that the tribunals are <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/staff-shortages-burdening-un-war-crimes-tribunals-ictr.php">in need of experienced staff to complete their work</a> [JURIST report], warning of the difficulties in retaining staff at the ICTY and the ICTR because both tribunals are nearing the end of their work and employees are leaving for more permanent jobs. Currently the ICTY is preparing to try its last two fugitives, captured earlier this year. Serbian general <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>] is being held pending his trial at The Hague following his May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] after 16 years on the run. He is charged with committing war crimes during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive] and the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] where 8,000 people were killed. Croation Serb rebel leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10733">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in June, is also being held at The Hague pending his trial also on charges of war crimes committed during the Bosnian civil war and Srebrenica massacre. Last month the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/former-mayor-of-rwanda-convicted-of-genocide-and-crimes-against-humanity.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan mayor <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/496.html">Gregoire Ndahimana</a> [HJP profile] of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. In September the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-acquits-former-ministers.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] two former Rwandan ministers, Casimir Bizimungu and Jerome Bicamumpaka, of genocide charges due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Rwandan genocide suspect and former Hutu militia leader Bernard Munyagishari is awaiting trial at the ICTR for charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, alleged to have recruited, trained and led a militia group that killed and raped Tutsi women during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwandan+Genocide">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

A joint investigation between the AP and a German public television company, <a href="http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/index.html">ARD Panorama</a> [media website, in German], reportedly uncovered the black site, whose existence has been rumored but never confirmed. The site is claimed to have been part of the CIA's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+secret+prison">secret prison</a> [JURIST news archive] network that operated overseas and were used to house and interrogate terrorists. The investigation found that high-profile terrorists including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khalid+sheikh">Khalid Sheik Mohammad</a> [JURIST news archive] were kept there until they were transported to the Guantanamo Bay prison facility in Cuba. All of the prisons were shut down in 2006, and the program was shut down in 2009. The Romanian government denied any activity in the building by the American government, while the CIA declined to discuss the detention program. The investigation found that once detainees were placed in the prisons, they endured sleep deprivation and other harsh interrogation techniques, but waterboarding was not allowed in Romania. 

<p>This is not the first discovery of CIA-run secret prisons. Investigations have previously uncovered locations in Lithuania and Poland. The Lithuanian National Security Committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department provided the CIA with <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/lithuania-parliamentary-committee.php">two secret facilities</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. In 2007 it was discovered that the CIA had prisons in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/cia-operated-secret-prisons-in-poland.php">Romania and Poland</a> [JURIST report], but the governments would never confirm or deny the allegations. In 2010 Poland requested US assistance in their investigation of the alleged prison, but the US government refused to cooperate. The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/">European Parliament</a> [official website] approved a report condemning member states for cooperating with the (CIA) in operating illegal secret prisons and extraordinary rendition flights in Europe in 2007. This action came in the wake of a 2006 report by the Legal Affairs Committee of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> [official website] report that alleged that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/europe-rights-watchdog-says-cia.php">14 European countries</a> [JURIST report] collaborated with the CIA by taking an active or passive role in secret prisons and rendition flights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcolombiaflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The representative to Colombia for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] Thursday reiterated his call for a peaceful solution to the country's ongoing armed conflict. Christian Salazar made his remarks at a press conference following an announcement by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/farc.htm">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] stating plans to move forward with the unilateral release of hostages currently being held by the paramilitary rebels. Last month a military offensive led to the deaths of four FARC hostages who were killed by their captors during the fighting, but Salazar stated he believed FARC's plan to release other hostages signaled a new phase of hostage liberation that might help lead both sides to a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict. However Salazar recognized at the press conference that at this point even talking about the armed conflict in Colombia was "extremely sensitive." To that end Salazar also praised the actions of Colombian <a href="http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/Paginas/Presidencia.aspx">President Juan Manuel Santos</a> [official website, in Spanish], who has maintained an open line of dialogue between FARC and the Colombian government, which Salazar held as important to preventing a longterm "spiral of violence" in the country. The rebels <a href="http://www.cmi.com.co/archivos/documentos/COMUNICADOfarc.doc">announced their plans</a> [letter, PDF, in Spanish] for the upcoming hostage release in a missive to former Colombian Senator Piedad Cordoba earlier this month.

<p>In June Santos signed the <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/11798-abc-de-la-ley-de-victimas-informe-especial">Victims' and Land Restitution Law</a> [Senate backgrounder, in Spanish], legislation that had been created to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/colombia-president-signs-victims-compensation-law.php">compensate victims of the country's armed conflict</a> and had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/colombia-senate-passes-victim-compensation-law.php">approved by the Senate</a> [JURIST reports] a month earlier. The law seeks to compensate millions of individuals by providing damages to relatives of those killed during the armed conflict, which has spanned over 40 years, as well as help to return land stolen throughout the conflict to its rightful owners. The US federal court system has heard several lawsuits seeking compensation for victims of Colombian violence. In February, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/eleventh-circuit-revives-colombia-wrongful-death-suit-against-alabama-company.php">revived a wrongful death lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against <a href="http://www.drummondco.com/">Drummond Company</a> [corporate website] in which it is alleged that the company successfully hired the paramilitary <a href="http://www.cfr.org/colombia/farc-eln-colombias-left-wing-guerrillas/p9272">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CFR backgrounder] to break up a new Drummond union and murder its leaders. In April 2010 victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/chiquita-sued-in-us-court-for-aiding.php">filed suit against Chiquita Brand International</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a>. The plaintiffs were 242 Colombians who alleged that they had been seriously injured or had family members killed by the AUC, which received funding from Chiquita. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after it admitted to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to the AUC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The June <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-allows-patents-of-human-genes.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] partially overturned a district court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-invalidates-patents-on.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] and upheld the validity of gene patents that prevent non-patent holders from studying, testing or even looking at a particular gene. In a petition for <em>writ of certiorari</em> filed with the Supreme Court Wednesday, the ACLU claims:<blockquote>The patenting of isolated DNA violates long-established Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the patenting of laws of nature, natural phenomena, products of nature, and abstract ideas. ... Patents on isolated DNA, whether small segments or whole genes, also violate the First Amendment because they block scientific inquiry into the patented DNA.</blockquote>The particular genes in this case, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA">BRCA1 and BRCA2</a> [NCI backgrounder], are two key genes related to breast and ovarian cancer research. <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> and the <a href="http://www.research.utah.edu/funding/uurf.html">University of Utah Research Foundation</a> [official websites] currently hold the patents on the genes and thus hold the rights the genes and are able to set the cost of testing and prevent researchers from studying the gene without gaining permission first. 

<p>The appeals court's decision countered the position held by the Obama administration, which had submitted an <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/genepatents-USamicusbrief.pdf"><em>amicus curie</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] in support of the ACLU and PUBPAT. The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> [official website] has issued patents for genes for decades. Such patents cover nearly 2,000 human genes and genetic research companies hold patents to approximately 20 percent of the human genetic code. Supporters of the patents argue that restricting patents on human genes would decrease the amount of genetic research performed by the public sector because it would no longer be profitable for companies to study human genes. Opponents claim that these restrictions often prevent patients from receiving proper medical care and complicate the research process in a way that deters potential researchers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1150.pdf">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-decide-case-over-title-to-riverbeds-3-others.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on the ability to patent under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_101.htm">35 USC &#167; 101</a> [text] the body's biological reaction to different dosages of a certain type of drug. <a href="http://www.prometheuslabs.com/">Prometheus Labs</a> [corporate website] patented the tests doctors use for determining the appropriate dosage of drugs for treating Crohn's disease and other autoimmune diseases. Mayo Collaborative has argued that the tests look at "natural phenomenon" and that doctors violate the patents simply by mentally recognizing the correlation, regardless of what the doctors do with this knowledge. During the oral argument, petitioner Mayo Collaborative argued that the patent attempts to protect a "law of nature" instead of the "application of a law of nature," which restricts doctors' ability to make treatment judgments based on patients' reactions to drugs. Respondent Prometheus Labs argued that the courts have permitted similar patents in the past, that the current patent involves only a narrow range of drugs and that it will not prevent future improvements in the field. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-218.pdf">PPL Montana v. Montana</a> [transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether the proper constitutional test for determining river navigability for title purposes requires a trial court to consider whether the river was considered navigable at the time the state joined the Union or whether the court can consider new evidence based on current use. <a href="http://www.pplmontana.com/">PPL Montana</a> (PPL) [corporate website], which owns a hydroelectric power dam on the Missouri River, brought the challenge after the Supreme Court of Montana <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/OpBelow.PPlMT_.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the title to the riverbeds passed to Montana when it became a state in 1889 and that the riverbeds are public trust lands under <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca/Constition/X/11.htm">Article X, Section 11</a> [text] under the Montana Constitution. The Supreme Court of Montana ordered PPL to pay $41 million in back rent and more in future rent for use of the riverbeds. Petitioner PPL argued that the Montana Supreme Court "deviat[ed] from well-settled principles of Federal navigability law" by failing to focus on specific river segments and considering modern instead of historical use of the river. Respondent the state of Montana replied that, under federal precedent, the state owns title to the riverbeds of navigable rivers and that the Montana Supreme Court properly applied the test for navigability in determining that the "river served as a continuous highway of commerce" at the time of statehood. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Chiume stated that the review was in <a href="http://www.africareview.com/News/Malawi+President+wants+bad+laws+reviewed/-/979180/1286052/-/4ryp9kz/-/">response to public criticism</a> [Africa Review report]. Commentators suggest that the purpose of the review of the ban on homosexual acts is to attract US aid. On Tuesday US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] announced that the US would use foreign assistance, international diplomacy and political asylum to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-to-use-foreign-aid-diplomacy-to-advance-lgbt-rights-globally.php">promote LGBT rights internationally</a> [JURIST report]. In addition to the ban on homosexual acts, laws which allow the government to shut down newspapers deemed to not be serving Malawi's interests, ban suits against government officials and allow police to search areas and make arrests without providing a reason will also be reviewed.

<p>Gay rights have been a <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16219402">contentious issue</a> [<em>Economist</em> backgrounder] in both developed and developing nations, with more than 80 countries criminalizing homosexuality. The issue is especially prevalent in Africa where over 70 percent of countries criminalize non-traditional sexual orientation, with some charges carrying the death penalty. Last week, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill making it <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nigeria-senate-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">illegal for same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST report] or for an individual to aid in the marriage of same-sex couples. The bill explicitly states that marriages entered into by persons of the same gender are prohibited and will not be recognized as valid, even if the marriage certificate is obtained in a foreign country. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/cases/UGHC/">Ugandan High Court</a> [official website] sentenced a man to 30 years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">beating to death prominent gay rights activist</a> [JURIST report] David Kato. Enock Nsubuga confessed to the January 2011 killing, admitting to beating Kato [Reuters report] with a hammer at his home before he died on the way to the hospital. Nsubuga claimed that he attacked Kato in response to sexual advances he made. In 2010 Mutharika <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-calls-for-reform-of-anti-gay-laws.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKlHY3vsfrU">video</a>] a gay couple sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges of "indecent practices between males" and "unnatural offences." Although Mutharika pardoned the men based on international pressure, he nevertheless reiterated that homosexuality was "totally wrong" and against the culture and traditions of Malawi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plan stated that there was a 14 percent rise in transgender-related hate crime between 2009 and 2010 and that only two EU member states explicitly address transgender hate crimes in their hate crime legislation. The report proposed amending <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/146">Section 146</a> and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/schedule/21">Schedule 21</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/contents">Criminal Justice Act 2003</a> [materials] so that crimes motivated by hostility towards transgender individuals are considered hate crimes and that the minimum sentence for murders motivated by hostility towards transgender individuals be 30 years. This is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16089715">double the current minimum sentence</a> [BBC report]. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/index.htm">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] later clarified that the increased minimum sentence would <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/features/feature081211.htm">also apply to murders motivated by hate of disabled people</a> [press release]. The plan also calls for a government-wide appraisal of transgender rights and the special needs of transgender individuals, greater protection for the privacy of transgender individuals and greater protection for transgender students in schools. The plan stated that over 70 percent of children who express gender variant behaviors are subject to bullying in school. <a href="http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/">Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone</a> [official website] stated that the transgender action plan was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi1mdqUevWU">"just the first step on this road"</a> [video] and that she hopes that the trans community is happy with the government's efforts.

<p>The rise of hate crimes against LGBT individuals has been an issue throughout the world. In July the <a href="http://nuovo.camera.it/1">Italian Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/italy-lower-house-rejects-LGBT-hate-crime-prevention-bill.php">rejected legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have provided greater penalties for hate crimes committed against homosexuals and transsexuals. As a member of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], Italy is a party to the <a href="http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in June. The resolution is the first to call for an end to sexuality discrimination worldwide and to recognize it as a "priority" for the UN. However, the resolution does not address any penalties for violating the act nor is it binding for members. In March, US Representative <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and Senator <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">introduced legislation to protect LGBT students</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools from bullying. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that contained a measure extending the definition of federal hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/mladic/#pressrel">Mladic case</a> [case materials] is expected to last years, and the court is anxious to avoid a similar delay in the legal process that allowed Slobodan Milosevic, Mladic's boss, to evade justice when he died of a heart attack in 2006 before his trial concluded. The defense team indicated it <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/12/08/un_court_aims_to_start_mladic_trial_march_27/">cannot meet the deadlines</a> [AP report] imposed by the judge, who conceded they were not written in stone. Claiming to have never heard of Bisina, Mladic insisted he had nothing to do with it, but indicated he was in no hurry to start his trial.

<p>Last week, a three-judge panel for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-judges-allow-reduced-indictment-against-mladic.php">ICTY accepted a request</a> brought last month by prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-speed-up-mladic-trial-reduce-evidence.php">reduce the number of crimes</a> [JURIST reports] they intend to prove against Mladic from 196 to 106. The request came days after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icty-orders-mladic-medical-exam.php">ICTY ordered a medical examination</a> [JURIST report] of Mladic's physical condition in response to his absence from court the week prior due to illness. In October, the ICTY prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">refused to seek further appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the tribunal's refusal to split Mladic's trial into separate actions: one for his conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. Before that, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">had lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal in Serbia</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">avoid extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Serbian <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">authorities captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages committed by Bosnian Serb forces under his command during the Bosnian civil war, which saw over 100,000 casualties and hundreds of thousands more displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His comments came after an <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11642&LangID=E">11-day visit to Argentina</a> [press release] including <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40665&Cr=argentina&Cr1=">meetings with both indigenous communities and government authorities</a> [UN News Centre report] in Buenos Aires. Focusing on land disputes between indigenous groups and excavating firms, Anaya explained:<blockquote>A central preoccupation expressed by indigenous leaders during my visit was the lack of judicial security over their land ownership rights and in particular the various problems and delays they face regarding their properties ... [and a] lack of dialogue and participation with the affected indigenous groups before undertaking such projects, and the lack of their role in the decision-making process, as well as of sharing the benefits of the projects resulting from use of their lands.</blockquote>Anaya is scheduled to give a full report next year to the UN Human Rights Council.

<p>The government of Argentina has ongoing issues with indigenous communities and currently has no mechanism for dialogue. In June 2007, the <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Supreme Court of Argentina</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/argentina-high-court-orders-protection.php">ordered the government to provide basic necessities to indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report] of the Chaco region while it investigated claims that their land has been illegally sold to commercial farmers. The amparo action, brought by the office of the <a href="http://www.dpn.gob.ar/">Defender of the People</a> [official website, in Spanish], alleged that government officials have denied food and medical aid to the Toba, Wichi and Mocovi tribes, which together claim 60,000 members in the Chaco region, resulting in malnourishment illnesses such as cholera and tuberculosis and, in some cases, death.  From June 2007, members of the <a href="http://www.survival-international.org/tribes/wichi">Wichi community</a> [Survival International profile] camped out in front of the Chaco regional government headquarters, some undergoing a hunger strike, to demand land rights, education and health care for the indigenous people of the Chaco. According to protesters, the government has permitted public lands reserved for indigenous groups in the Chaco to be sold to growers of genetically modified soy. In 2003, the Wichi won a legal battle against the government when the Supreme Court ruled that licenses to conduct commercial logging on the Wichi's traditional lands could not be granted without prior consultation with the tribe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first was an appeal from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-vacate-california-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">refusal</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] to vacate former US district court judge Vaughn Walker's decision striking down Proposition 8 because he failed to disclose his own homosexuality and 10-year same-sex relationship. Proponents of Propostion 8, which include <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website], argued in their <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/21/11-16577_reply_brief.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] that they had no problem with Walker hearing the case so long as "a reasonable person ... would not have reason to believe that the judge has a current personal interest in marrying if Plaintiffs prevail." Opponents, including the <a href="http://www.afer.org/">American Foundation for Equal Rights</a> [advocacy website], countered this statement by <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/01/11-16577_appellees_answering_brief.pdf">arguing</a> [text, PDF] that the district court properly ruled that recusal was not required, and, even if it was, vacating the judgment would be a "drastic and inappropriate remedy resulting in injustice to the Plaintiffs in this case." The second issue was whether <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-stays-release-of-proposition-8-trial-videos.php">video recordings</a> [JURIST report] of the 2010 trial should be released to the public. Proposition 8 supporters <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/29/11-17255_reply_brief_defendant.pdf">argued</a> [text, PDF] against the release because it could lead to harassment of their witnesses and claimed that the First Amendment right of access has no application in this instance. Proposition 8 opponents <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/16/11-17255_brief_plaintiff.pdf">argued</a> [text, PDF] that there is no reason not to make the recordings public, and, in fact, it is in the public interest to do so.

<p>In November, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that sponsors of Proposition 8 <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/index_2011_11_17.php">have standing</a> [JURIST report] to defend the measure in court. The same-sex marriage ban was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down last year</a> [JURIST report], and then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. In March, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST reports] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_video_subpage.php?pk_vid=0000006121">heard oral arguments</a> [video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">report</a>] on both the issue of standing and constitutionality last December but has not yet ruled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/about/governors-bio">Governor Neil Abercrombie</a> (D) [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-governor-signs-same-sex-unions-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/bills/SB232_HD1_.pdf">same-sex civil unions bill</a> [SB 232 text, PDF] into law in February. The legislation, set to go into effect on January 1, 2012, extends the same rights, benefits, protections and responsibilities of spouses in a marriage to partners in a civil union, but plaintiffs Natasha Jackson and Janin Kleid claim they are still being denied a "fundamental right" to marry under Hawaii's <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrs2006/Vol12_Ch0501-0588/HRS0572/HRS_0572-0001.HTM">marriage law</a> [text], which restricts marriage to a man and a woman. Jackson and Kleid applied for a marriage license last month and were denied. They claim the state is depriving them of their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution. A spokesperson for Abercrombie <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/135268223.html">declined to comment on the suit</a> [<em>Star Advertiser</em> report] and said the complaint is currently being reviewed.

<p>Same-sex marriage and civil unions remain controversial throughout the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-proposition-8-issues.php">mulling Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report], California's same-sex marriage ban. Last month a New York state court judge ruled that a lawsuit challenging the state's recognition of same-sex marriage <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/challenge-to-new-york-same-sex-marriage-act-allowed-to-proceed.php">can proceed</a> [JURIST report]. In September, the North Carolina legislature approved putting a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/north-carolina-legislature-approves-ballot-measure-to-ban-same-sex-marriage.php">constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] on a statewide ballot to be voted on in May.

The <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10820">charges</a> [press release] were brought against Pecanac in October when he failed to comply with a subpoena to testify as a witness in the trial against <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/791/4">Zdravko Tolimir</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-begins-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">report</a>], his former commander. In issuing its ruling, the ICTY found that Pecanac's actions failed to comply with the interests of justice:<blockquote>Contempt of the Tribunal is a serious offence, which goes to the essence of the administration of justice. By his failure to comply with the Subpoena and to appear at the seat of the Tribunal and testify, the Accused has acted against the interests of justice. His failure to testify has deprived the Chamber of relevant evidence. The Tribunal is dependent on witness testimony and the deprivation of such relevant evidence amounts to a serious interference with the administration of justice, and in fact, endangers the fulfillment of the Tribunal's functions and mandate.</blockquote>Pecanac was sentenced to three months in prison, but will get credit for the 74 days he has already served.

<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7PLjp0dMWbE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The tribunal issued a subpoena for Pecanac in August. When he failed to appear in September, the tribunal issued an order for contempt, in lieu of an indictment as well as an arrest warrant. In mid-October he entered a not guilty plea. Earlier this week the tribunal heard former Serbian general and alleged war criminal <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mladic-pleads-not-guilty-trial-set-for-march.php">enter a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST report] to charges linked to the execution of more than 30 Muslim prisoners in the eastern town of Bisina in July 1995. He had previously refused to enter a plea in any of the charges against him. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mladic-pleads-not-guilty-trial-set-for-march.php">trial</a> [JURIST report] is scheduled to begin in March 2012. The ICTY reported to the UN Security Council on Thursday that the it is reaching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-war-crimes-tribunals-report-progress-to-security-council.php">successful conclusion</a> [JURIST report] since the last two fugitives wanted by the ICTY were captured.

The <a href="http://www.icrwhale.org/eng-index.html">Institute of Cetacean Research</a> (ICR) [official website] and the Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha claim that the SSCS and its founder Paul Watson are preventing them from engaging in what they say is lawful activity under Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/convention.pdf">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [text, PDF], which allows for the taking of whales for scientific research purposes.

Croatia will now officially become the twenty-eighth member of the EU in 2013. The signing ceremony consisted of speeches by leaders of the EU and Croatia, as well as signing of the treaty by the 27 other member countries. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/11/869">speech</a> [text] delivered at the ceremony:<blockquote>Croatia today is very different to the country that applied for accession a decade ago.It is ready to shoulder the substantial responsibilities of EU membership. It meets the Copenhagen political criteria, which were always a particular focus of the Commission's work. Ensuring that democratic principles, fundamental rights and the rule of law are respected and further strengthened was and is vital&#8212;for us but even more so for Croatia's own development and prosperity. This reform momentum now needs to be maintained.</blockquote>Croatia will now serve as an active observer of the EU until its membership begins in 2013.

<p>The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-gives-final-approval-to-croatia-membership.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to Croatian membership in June after six years of negotiations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttymoshenko.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Ukrainian court on Thursday ordered the indefinite arrest of former prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>] despite the chance that her current <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">seven-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] may still be overturned, drawing international criticism. Because Tymoshenko had already begun serving time on her original abuse-of-office charges when the court issued the order, the former prime minister was re-arrested in her cell at a Kiev detention center. This time, prosecutors are alleging that Tymoshenko was involved in tax evasion and theft of government funds between 1996 and 2000, a time when she led the intermediary gas company United Energy Systems. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118626/">expressed its concern</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report] regarding a lack of transparency of Ukrainian hearings in prison, and declared that such a process does not correspond to the jurisprudence of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. In a statement sent to <a href="http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/">Interfax-Ukraine</a> [Interfax news archive], the Commission called on Ukrainian authorities to ensure fair, impartial and transparent legal proceedings. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.ssu.gov.ua/sbu/control/en/index;jsessionid=3A91961FE1D3E286F0FC9700199C8F0C">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website] has defended the re-arrest of Tymoshenko by claiming that a hearing conducted in prison is not inconsistent with Ukrainian law. The SBU, however, did not remark on whether such procedure contradicts European Community law.

<p>Tymoshenko was originally sentenced in October for abuse of office when, as prime minister, she signed a gas supply contract with Russia in 2009. Her prosecution has been closely followed and <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">internationally controversial</a> [JURIST comment], including harsh criticism from the West. In November, the Ukrainian Parliament <a href="http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=290035&cat_id=105995">voted against</a> [agenda text] hearing amendments that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ukraine-parliament-rejects-hearing-bill-designed-to-free-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">may have freed</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko by fining her rather than sentencing her for her criminal convictions. The EU has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the former prime minister's conviction as politically-motivated, and has indicated that the prosecution could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. Tymoshenko herself has also made efforts to demonstrate that the charges are motivated by her adversaries, but to no avail. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused an appeal</a> [JURIST report] of her detention for contempt charges for a lack of legal grounds to contest the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report]. Also, in June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging various violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and arguing that her charges were politically engineered by current Ukrainian president and long-time political rival <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website]. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the presidential election in March 2010, but Tymoshenko has claimed that widespread voter fraud contributed to the outcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Davis, et al.</span>, deals with the Texas state senate. The justices set one hour of argument for all three cases for January 9.

<p>According to the 2010 census, Texas' population grew by 4.3 million, which gave it four more seats in the US House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the congressional districts in a way that challengers claim would make it more likely for Republicans to win those new seats. The plan must be approved by either the Justice Department or a federal court under the VRA, and the Obama administration has objected to the plan. In the meantime, the federal court in Texas drew an "interim map" for use in the 2012 election. That is the map that is currently being challenged before the Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bentley assured that the group had no plans to repeal the law, even with <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">pending challenges</a> [JURIST report] from the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. According to Bailey, "the essence of the law will not change, but state leaders pledged the revisions to the law will be offered for consideration early in the next Legislative Session so that the law works, it can be enforced and it reflects the hospitable nature of Alabamians." He recognized that changes need to be made so that the law is fair and just, but the governor stood behind his campaign for an effective illegal immigration law. A bill is being developed for consideration at the start of Alabama's next legislative session. The bill's purpose is to clarify, simplify, ensure that all individuals working in Alabama are doing so legally and enable law enforcement to effectively enforce the law.

<p>Last week Alabama <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Attorney General Luther Strange</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/index_2011_12_07.php#39502">suggested repealing specific provisions</a> [JURIST report] of the state's controversial immigration law which criminalize the failure of illegal immigrants to carry registration documents and require public schools to collect information regarding the immigration status of their students. Both these provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in an October ruling of the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. The law has faced numerous challenges since taking effect in September. The DOJ challenged the law resulting in a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66701706/Summary-Opinion-on-Alabama-Immigration-Law">ruling</a> [opinion text] at the end of September that allowed the state to enforce a provision that makes it a felony for an illegal alien to conduct business with the state, among other provisions. The DOJ argued that Alabama's immigration law was preempted by federal laws regulating immigration in the US because of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a separate brief also asking the court to overturn the new law. The ACLU's brief argued that the laws are designed to make life in Alabama so difficult for illegal aliens that they will be <a href="/forum/2011/11/kevin-johnson-alabama-immigration.php">forced to leave the state</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Like the DOJ, the ACLU argued that Alabama's law is a direct attempt to regulate immigration, which is an area that the states have no legitimate interest in regulating and is left only to the federal government to legislate. Alabama's immigration law is <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=immigration">only one of the immigration measures</a> [JURIST news archive] currently being challenged by the DOJ, ACLU and others. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Named the <a href="http://sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Saving-American-Democracy.pdf">Saving American Democracy Amendment</a> [text, PDF] the proposal would make clear that corporations are not afforded the same constitutional rights as people and that the political activities of corporations can be regulated by the government. Sanders added that the law would also ban unlimited corporate campaign contributions to candidates. The amendment, he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/saving-our-democracy_b_1137783.html?ref=yahoo&ir=Yahoo">stated</a> [transcript], was created to counteract the controversial 5-4 ruling by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [JURIST report] that a corporation possesses the same First Amendment free speech rights as that of a person:<blockquote>The Constitution of this country has served us well, but when the Supreme Court says that attempts by the federal government and states to impose reasonable restrictions on campaign ads are unconstitutional, our democracy is in grave danger. ... I strongly disagree with the ruling. In my view, a corporation is not a person. A corporation does not have First Amendment rights to spend as much money as it wants, without disclosure, on a political campaign. Corporations should not be able to go into their treasuries and spend millions and millions of dollars on a campaign in order to buy elections.</blockquote>Sanders concluded that even though a number of bills have been proposed as a counteraction to the Supreme Court's ruling, the most effective way to reverse the alleged error is to send a "constitutional amendment to the states that says simply and straightforwardly what everyone, except five members of the United States Supreme Court, understands: Corporations are not people with equal constitutional rights."

<p>The Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> has remained controversial since it was issued in January 2010. Last year, Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-senate-fails-to-advance-campaign-finance-reform-bill.php">failed to advance campaign finance reform</a> [JURIST report] put forth by members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. US <a href="http://www.schumer.senate.gov/">Senator Charles Schumer</a> (D-NY) and <a href="http://vanhollen.house.gov/">Representative Chris van Hollen</a> (D-MD) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-lawmakers-propose-legislation-to.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] as well as <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/democratic-senator-introduces-amended-campaign-finance-legislation.php">amended legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would ban foreign companies, companies controlled by foreign companies or governments, government contractors and recipients of the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/Pages/default.aspx">Trouble Asset Relief Program</a> (TARP) [official website] funds from contributing to US elections. The proposed legislation also called for corporate CEOs to report their political spending to the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Committee</a> [official website]. The administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] has likewise been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/white-house-presses-critique-of-high.php">publicly critical</a> [JURIST report] of the Supreme Court's decision, most notably in the president's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union Address</a> [transcript] in January 2010 where he remarked that the the ruling "will open to floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] and Panamanian authorities have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">seeking Noriega's extradition</a>  [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama since April 2010.

In April 2010, Noriega was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> to France from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges, after <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fighting extradition</a> [JURIST reports] since 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Delegates from 194 countries at the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">Durban UN Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] in South Africa agreed on Sunday to negotiate global initiatives that would eventually force countries to take legally-binding action in order to slow the pace of climate change. After two weeks of debate, the delegates agreed on four major proposals. First, the countries decided to extend the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text, PDF; UN <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php">backgrounder</a>], whose first phase of emissions cuts runs from 2008 to the end of 2012. Under Sunday's proposal, the second commitment to Kyoto will extend from the beginning of 2012 until the end of 2017. Second, in light of a failure to create a new, internationally-binding treaty at a climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the delegates agreed to form a process known as the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l10.pdf">Durban Platform for Enhanced Action</a> [proposal text, PDF] which entails negotiations to form a legally-binding climate change agreement by 2015 to be enacted by 2020. Third, although poor nations have consistently needed help to finance the adaptations to climate change, the debt crisis has forced developed nations to also limit their contributions to the initiative. The delegates broke ground in agreeing to design a <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l09.pdf">Green Climate Fund</a> [proposal text, PDF] to pool up to $100 billion a year by 2020 for poor countries, but they did not establish how they would reach this number, nor who would contribute to it. Finally, the delegates agreed that implementing a new internationally-binding instrument would raise ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As such, they decided to launch a work plan to close the "ambition gap" between countries' current emissions reduction pledges for 2020 and the goal of keeping global warming below two degrees Celsius. Other proposals that were raised but not agreed upon include mechanisms for <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l08a01.pdf">national adaptation plans</a> [proposal text] and an extension of emissions cut pledges made in Copenhagen in 2009 and in Cancun in 2010.

<p>The negotiations at Durban came shortly after the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/#">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC [official website], a UN-led scientific panel, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/UN-panel-releases-summary-on-risk-management-in-face-of-increased-environmental-disasters.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its <a href="http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPM_Approved-HiRes_opt.pdf">summary for policymakers</a> [text, PDF] regarding risk management for disasters related to climate change. In July, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] made its <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/security-council-declares-global-warming-threat-to-international-security.php">first official statement</a> [JURIST report] implicating climate change as a serious threat to world peace and security. At the urging of Germany, which released a <a href="http://www.new-york-un.diplo.de/Vertretung/newyorkvn/en/__pr/Press_20releases/PM__2011/110719_20Impact_20of_20Climate_20Change.html?archive=2990092">Concept Note</a> [text] to lead the discussion, the Security Council debated <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/">global warming</a> [EPA materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=global+warming">news archive</a>] for the first time since 2007. Though Germany took the initiative, its attempt was reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14229237">not as strong as some of the nations wanted</a> [BBC report], including Russia's push for "possible security implications," and other countries' urging to create a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/20/un-climate-change-peacekeeping">"green helmets" peacekeeping force</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that would intervene in conflicts where environmental resources became scarce. UN delegates have met several times to discuss an extension of the Kyoto Protocol. Notably, the delegates met in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2009 to negotiate the Protocol's replacement following its expiration. There, members agreed to the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/l07.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF] which was not legally-binding nor a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, but nonetheless endorsed its continuation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-illegal-searches-deportation.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [official website] policy for deciding when resident aliens may apply to the Attorney General for relief from deportation under a now-repealed provision of the immigration laws is arbitrary and capricious. Joel Judulang, the son of immigrants from the Philippines, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1989 and later claimed that he could seek a discretionary waiver of deportation under 212(c) of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&amp;CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/memdispo.nsf/pdfview/091707/$File/06-70986.PDF">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Judulang's aggravated felony crime of violence was not a ground for exclusion under the statute. In an unanimous opinion authored by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded:<blockquote>We must reverse an agency policy when we cannot discern a reason for it. That is the trouble in this case. The BIA's comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allows an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to govern a matter of the utmost importance&#8212;whether lawful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country may stay here. And contrary to the Government's protestations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost considerations. The BIA's approach therefore cannot pass muster under ordinary principles of administrative law.</blockquote>The court reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.

<p>Also Monday, the court issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-74.pdf">per curiam opinion</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-74.htm">Hardy v.

The court found that the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit departed from this standard when it reversed a district court's denial of Irving Cross' <em>habeas corpus</em> petition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Medvedev posted a message to his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dmitry.Medvedev">Facebook page</a> [website, in Russian] Sunday following <a href="http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111210/169663206.html">massive protests</a> [RIA Novosti] across Russia on Saturday. Medvedev said:<blockquote>Under the Constitution, Russian citizens enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. People have a right to express their position, and they did that yesterday. Fortunately, everything proceeded within the bounds of the law. I do not agree with any slogans or statements made at the rallies. Nevertheless, I have given instructions to check all the complaints from the polling stations for compliance with the electoral legislation.</blockquote>Protests are also <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/12/bloomberg_articlesLW26QN1A1I4H.DTL">planned for the next two weekends</a> [Bloomberg report].

The impeachment proceedings required at least 95 signatures to move forward and, in the end, 188 of the 284 members of congress voted to impeach Corona. There are <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/12/12/11/summary-impeachment-complaint-vs-cj-corona">eight charges</a> [text] brought against Corona, including failure to disclose his personal finances and several allegations of partiality. The most high profile of the allegations includes a charge of partiality when it comes to the trial of Arroyo. It is alleged Corona granted temporary restraining order on the travel restriction of Arroyo without legal grounds in order to give her a chance to escape. The charges will now be brought to trial. If found guilty, Corona will likely be forced out of office.

Pillay reported that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the ongoing conflict, including more than 300 children. She also said that there were reports of torture in detention centers. Speaking to reporters after the briefing, Pillay <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/12/un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-navi-pillay-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-syria-and-gaza-security-council-media-stakeout.html">said</a> [video]:<blockquote>This is what I recommended to the Security Council: I indicated in some detail the evidence. And so it is based on the evidence and the widespread and systematic nature of the killings, the detentions and the acts of torture that I felt that these acts constituted crimes against humanity, and I recommended that there should be a referral to the International Criminal Court.</blockquote>Pillay also called on the Syrian government to allow human rights monitors into the country and to cooperate fully with the investigations.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">strongly condemning the recent violence</a> [JURIST report] in Syria. The resolution came after the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria reported that the Syrian government has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">committed numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] including torture, sexual violence, use of excessive force and violations of the right to peaceful assembly. Last month the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/C.3/66/L.57/Rev.1">draft resolution</a> [materials] condemning Syria's human rights violations and calling for their immediate end.

The court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-requests-explanation-from-malawi-for-failure-to-arrest-sudanese-president.php">asked Malawi for an explanation</a> [JURIST report] of its actions. The ICC found "no conflict between Malawi's obligations towards the Court and its obligations under customary international law. The court concluded:<blockquote>[I]t is the view of the Chamber that when cooperating with this Court and therefore acting on its behalf, States Parties are instruments for the enforcement of the <em>jus puniendi</em> of the international community whose exercise has been entrusted to this Court when States have failed to prosecute those
responsible for the crimes within its jurisdiction. The Chamber therefore finds, in accordance with article 87(7) of the
Statute that the Republic of Malawi has failed to comply with the Cooperation Requests contrary to the provisions of the Statute and has thereby prevented the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute. The
Chamber decides to refer the matter both to the United Nations Security Council and to the Assembly of States Parties.</blockquote>The court reiterated that there is no immunity for heads of state who commit international crimes.

<p>The ICC has previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">reported Kenya and Chad</a> [JURIST report] for failing to arrest al-Bashir when he visited those countries. Last month the Kenyan High Court ruled that al-Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/kenya-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-sudan-president-al-bashir.php">must be arrested</a> [JURIST report] if he ever returns to the country. In June ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur. In May, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Bashir faces <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> as well as <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">three charges of genocide</a> [JURIST reports] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>

<p>1:00 PM ET ~ The ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1287888.pdf">reported Chad</a> [decision, PDF, in French; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/371A3E88-35C6-4C54-8C98-60B92D3E140A.htm">press release</a>] Tuesday for failing to arrest al-Bashir when he visted the country in August of this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was brought by <a href="http://www.wrtl.org/">Wisconsin Right to Life</a> [advocacy website] before the 2010 gubernatorial election on grounds that the law violated the First Amendment. The unanimous decision <a href="http://www.wrtl.org/blog/index.php/2011/12/12/wisconsin-right-to-life-state-political-action-committe-wins-sweeping-victory-in-seventh-circuit-court-of-appeals/">does not apply</a> [press release] to political action committees that give contributions to candidates or political parties, only to those that act independently of candidates or political parties. All citizens of Wisconsin did not greet the decision warmly. Mike McCabe, the executive director of Wisconsin Democracy Campaign said that the decision would cede too much power to political action committees in deciding elections. The appeal followed a decision by the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] that dismissed the case on grounds that the law was <a href="http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/WRTL_Decision_033111.pdf">not unduly burdensome</a> [order, PDF] on Wisconsin Right to Life. 

<p>Several courts have recently decided issues relating to <a href="/currentawareness/campaignfinance.php">campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive]. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that an Arizona campaign finance regulation <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota law that prohibited direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. The <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] ruled in 2009 that a Connecticut campaign finance law <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-rules-connecticut.php">discriminated against minor party candidates</a> [JURIST report] that violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Many of the issues pertaining to the legality of campaign finance laws arose when the Supreme Court made its <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</span>, which limited the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> [text, PDF].

According to the report, corruption flourishes where land governance is efficient. "Weak land governance tends to be characterised by low levels of transparency, accountability and the rule of law." Corruption can involve public officials as well as private actors and can "undo the legal and social legitimacy of
these actors if they are considered to be too corrupt." The report recommends "build[ing] transparent, effective and accountable land tenure systems," revising land policies, "provid[ing] legal recognition to tenure rights that are considered legitimate but are not correctly protected by law" and "promot[ing] more transparent and effective land certification and registration systems."

<p>Earlier this month, TI released its 2011 <a href="http://www.transparency.org/content/download/64426/1030807">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> (CPI) [report, PDF], again showing some governments <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/183-countries-ranked-in-annual-corruption-index.php">failing to protect citizens from corruption</a> [JURIST report], be it abuse of public resources, bribery or secretive decision-making. The CPI scores 183 countries and territories from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean) based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, using data from 17 surveys collected by independent agencies concerning bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds, access to information, conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of any anti-corruption campaign at work in a country. New Zealand tops the list with a score of 9.5, followed by Denmark and Finland with 9.4 and Sweden with 9.3. The US again scored 7.1, ranking 24th. Last on the list is Somalia, ranked as the most corrupt country for the fourth year in a row and tied at 1.0 with North Korea, which this year was included in the index for the first time. Two-thirds of all ranked countries scored less than 5. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Liechtenstein's UN Ambassador Christian Wenaweser, outgoing president of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) to the Rome Statute that set up the ICC, announced last month that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icc-deputy-prosecutor-to-be-recommended-as-next-chief-prosecutor.php">recommend Bensouda as the sole candidate</a> [JURIST report] for the position. Bensouda was elected by the ASP Monday as they met for their <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NetApp/App/MCMSTemplates/Content.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID={8E728EC3-5785-4127-83D7-D910D99DF603}&NRORIGINALURL=/Menus/ASP/Sessions/Documentation/10th+Session/Tenth+session+of+the+Assembly+of+States+Parties.htm&NRCACHEHINT=Guest#DOCUMENTATION">Tenth Session</a> [materials]. In <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/ASP10/Statements/ASP10-ST-FatouBensouda-ENG.pdf">prepared remarks</a> to the ASP, Bensouda said:<blockquote>In Rome in 1998, representatives from civil society and from States with different legal traditions debated the creation of the Rome Statute from different perspectives, but all knew that the new legal design would profoundly impact the way international relations are governed. It is impacting other institutions and indeed, as Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said, changing international relations forever. As the next Prosecutor, I hope to contribute to solidifying this change, remaining committed to the goals of the Court and the legal mandate entrusted to the Prosecutor to end impunity for those responsible for the gravest offenses, bringing justice to their victims, and preventing future crimes.</blockquote>Bensouda has been Deputy Prosecutor of the ICC since 2004, and has long been considered the favorite to succeed Ocampo, as many of the ICC's cases currently focus on Africa. Additionally, Bensouda has the backing of the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website], the support of which has been critical to the ICC. Bensouda will take office in July 2012.

<p><br />
In October the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/Elections/Prosecutor/">Search Committee for the position of the Prosecutor of the ICC</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/four-candidates-named-as-potential-successors-to-icc-prosecutor.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] its consensus report to the Bureau of the ASP with the shortlist of four names after interviewing eight candidates from a list of 52 potentials. There was one other African on the list, Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, currently Chief Justice of the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/">Judiciary of Tanzania</a> [official website]. Also on the list were <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/ocp/cayley">Andrew Cayley</a> [official profile] of the UK, International Co-Prosecutor at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and Robert Petit of Canada, Counsel, <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/warcrimes-crimesdeguerre/home-accueil-eng.asp">Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes</a> [official website] Section of Canada's Department of Justice. As its first Prosecutor, Argentinian Ocampo has been widely praised for his promotion of the work of the ICC. During his tenure he has launched seven formal investigations, begun three <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-ends-first-war-crimes-trial.php">trials</a> and issued <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">arrest warrants for Sudanese president</a> [JURIST reports] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">Omar al-Bashir</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] and other military leaders wanted for human rights violations. However <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/hrw-report-criticizes-icc-prosecutions.php">Ocampo has also been criticized</a> [JURIST report] for the ICC's slow progress in achieving results, particularly in failing to bring a larger number of senior government officials to trial for various atrocities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcanada.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=B6832638-1">Minister of the Environment Peter Kent</a> [official profile] announced Monday that <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=FFE36B6D-1&news=6B04014B-54FC-4739-B22C-F9CD9A840800">Canada will withdraw</a> [statement] from the <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/1678.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/kyoto.php">news archive</a>] on climate change, making it the first country to do so. The treaty was signed by Canada's previous Liberal government, but little had been done to implement it. Kent said that the protocol "will not work" because it does not cover the two largest emitters, the US and China. He called it an "impediment" and said:<blockquote>We believe that a new agreement, with legally binding commitments for all major emitters, that allows us as a country to continue to generate jobs and economic growth, represents the path forward. ... Canada will work towards a legally binding agreement to address global emissions that allows us to continue creating jobs and economic growth in Canada. Domestically, we will continue to do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ... We are also helping developing countries do their part with investments that will help them reduce their emissions and deal with the effects of climate change.</blockquote>The decision has been <a href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/en/tar-sands/media/release/canada%E2%80%99s-shame">criticized</a> [press release] by environmental groups such as the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/">Sierra Club Canada</a> [advocacy website]. UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres expressed disappointment and said that Canada still "has a legal obligation under the [Climate Change] Convention to reduce its emissions, and a moral obligation to itself and future generations to lead in the global effort."

<p>Kent's announcement comes just one day after the conclusion of the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">Durban UN Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] in South Africa. Delegates from 194 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/jurist-delegates-from-194-countries.php">agreed to negotiate global initiatives</a> [JURIST report] that would eventually force countries to take legally-binding action in order to slow the pace of climate change. After two weeks of debate, the delegates agreed on four major proposals. First, the countries decided to extend the Kyoto Protocol, whose first phase of emissions cuts runs from 2008 to the end of 2012. Under Sunday's proposal, the second commitment to Kyoto will extend from the beginning of 2012 until the end of 2017. Second, in light of a failure to create a new, internationally-binding treaty at a climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the delegates agreed to form a process known as the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l10.pdf">Durban Platform for Enhanced Action</a> [proposal text, PDF] which entails negotiations to form a legally-binding climate change agreement by 2015 to be enacted by 2020. Third, although poor nations have consistently needed help to finance the adaptations to climate change, the debt crisis has forced developed nations to also limit their contributions to the initiative. The delegates broke ground in agreeing to design a <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l09.pdf">Green Climate Fund</a> [proposal text, PDF] to pool up to $100 billion a year by 2020 for poor countries, but they did not establish how they would reach this number, nor who would contribute to it. Finally, the delegates agreed that implementing a new internationally-binding instrument would raise ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As such, they decided to launch a work plan to close the "ambition gap" between countries' current emissions reduction pledges for 2020 and the goal of keeping global warming below two degrees Celsius. Other proposals that were raised but not agreed upon include mechanisms for <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/l08a01.pdf">national adaptation plans</a> [proposal text] and an extension of emissions cut pledges made in Copenhagen in 2009 and in Cancun in 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Trial Chamber found last month that Ieng Thirith is <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/with-only-a-few-days.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes because of dementia from Alzheimer's disease and ordered her immediate release. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/prosecutors-appeal-decision-to-release-khmer-rouge-leader.php">prosecution appealed</a> [JURIST report]. Granting the prosecution's request, the Supreme Court Chamber found that the Trial Chamber must exhaust all measures to help Ieng Thirith become fit to stand trial. The Supreme Court Chamber ordered the Trial Chamber to arrange for treatment and reevaluate the accused after six months. Ieng Thirith, the former minister of social affairs under the Khmer Rouge regime, was the only female leader to be charged.

<p>Ieng Thirith was declared unfit to stand trial just days before the trial of her and three other defendants was set to begin. <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a>, the Khmer Rouge's chief ideologist, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a>, a former head of state, and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-sary">Ieng Sary</a> [ECCC profiles], the former foreign minister, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-opens-trial-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] last month on charges of crimes against humanity, breach of international law and genocide. In testimony last week, Nuon Chea denied responsibility for the deaths of around 1.7 million people during the regime's rule during the 1970s.  Because of the old age of the defendants, the tribunal decided to split the case into a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report]. The first trial will focus on the beginning two phases of population movement and allegations of crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution not on religious grounds and forced disappearances associated with the first phases of population movement. Subsequent trials will focus on the third phase of population movement, genocide, persecution based on religious grounds and violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The first segment of the trial is expected to conclude by December 16 for a recess and will resume after the break on January 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Suu Kyi's <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League of Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website] decided last month to reenter politics after boycotting last year's elections in which Suu Kyi was not allowed to run. The move may allow Suu Kyi to run for parliament after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">detained under house</a> arrest for nearly eight years. A date for the next elections has not yet been set.

<p>Myanmar has made a series of reforms following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system in March after holding its first elections in 20 years. In October US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that Myanmar's civilian-led government was planning dramatic changes including <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-to-free-hundreds-of-political-prisoners.php">releasing hundreds of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and consequential dialogue with Suu Kyi. Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">formed a national human rights commission</a> [JURIST report] in September to promote and safeguard the country's constitutional rights. In August, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana urged the government of Myanmar to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">investigate human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and improve its rights record. In May, Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-releasing-nearly-15000-prisoners-after-un-visit.php">began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-with-controversial-detainee-provision.php">passed by the Senate</a> [JURIST report] in its original form earlier this month, included a controversial provision authorizing the president to use "all necessary and appropriate force" to detain individuals suspected of terrorism. President Barack Obama expressed concerns that some of the provisions in the bill were "legally questionable" in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf">Statement of Administrative Policy</a> [text, PDF] released in November. Lawmakers said they hoped the additional text would dispel uncertainty and eliminate the threat of a presidential veto. Opponents of the bill fear it could be a threat to the constitutional liberties of US citizens. Supporters argue that the idea of an American citizen suspected of aiding <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">news archive</a>] not getting due process is simply a lie. The White House has not issue a statement addressing the modifications to the bill. 

<p>The provision in question was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] in a unanimous vote after disagreements regarding the provision had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked their passage for months</a> [CNN report]. The passage by the SASC came shortly after an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [PDF] claiming that the US is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. The report posits that certain US policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to close the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news archive], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The controversial law states that any qualified voter must present photo identification at the polls in order to vote in Wisconsin elections for local, state, or federal offices, or referenda. The plaintiffs claim that the law unconstitutionally deprives citizens of their right to vote. In the complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.wieb.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], plaintiffs argue:<blockquote>The photo ID law imposes a severe and undue burden on the fundamental right to vote under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; violates the Twenty-Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as an unconstitutional poll tax; and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in arbitrarily refusing to accept certain identification documents.</blockquote>Plaintiffs seek declaratory an injunctive relief. A <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/10/womens-group-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">similar lawsuit</a> was filed in the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] in October by the <a href="http://www.lwvwi.org/">League of Women Voters of Wisconsin</a> [advocacy website].

<p>There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August, South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-democrats-protest-against-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking it to reject the state's new voter identification law. The caucus argued that the law, which requires South Carolina residents to present a current government-issued ID, is too restrictive and may disenfranchise African American and elderly voters. The objection followed earlier <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">attempts by several South Carolina civil rights groups</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the law from being implemented. In October 2010, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. The court held that the law, Proposition 200, was inconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko was <a href="http://rt.com/news/tymoshenko-appeal-denied-court-781/">absent from the hearing</a> [RT report] due to continuing health issues, although there have been reports that the court may eventually order her to attend. During the hearing, her defense lawyer <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/jailed-ukrainian-ex-pm-tymoshenko-absent-from-appeals-hearing-due-to-illness/2011/12/13/gIQATByxrO_story.html">read a letter</a> [AP report], in which Tymoshenko described the severe back pain that was keeping her from the proceeding. Tymoshenko was convicted of corruption and abuse of authority while <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hc2N8rYTQ2WwTsYkM-GY39UrhGPQ?docId=bd2ce6c95ceb4ed9982b39e0f184e716">negotiating a gas contract with Russia</a> [AP report] in 2009, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Her appeal of that sentence <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ukraine-court-begins-hearing-appeal-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">began earlier this month</a> [JURIST report]. However, even if the petition for her release from custody would have been successful, she likely would have remained in custody as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/indefinite-detention-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-draws-criticism.php">court order for indefinite detention</a> [JURIST report] entered last week. That order was the result of allegations that Tymoshenko was involved in tax evasion and theft of government funds between 1996 and 2000, a time when she led the intermediary gas company United Energy Systems. 

<p>Tymoshenko's prosecution has been <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">highly controversial</a> [JURIST comment] and has drawn harsh criticism internationally. Last week, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118626/">expressed its concern</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report] regarding a lack of transparency of Ukrainian hearings in prison, and declared that such a process does not correspond to the jurisprudence of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. In November, the Ukrainian Parliament <a href="http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=290035&cat_id=105995">voted against</a> [agenda text] hearing amendments that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ukraine-parliament-rejects-hearing-bill-designed-to-free-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">may have freed</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko by fining her rather than sentencing her for her criminal convictions. The EU has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the former prime minister's conviction as politically-motivated, and has indicated that the prosecution could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. Tymoshenko herself has also made efforts to demonstrate that the charges are motivated by her adversaries, but to no avail. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused an appeal</a> of her detention for contempt charges for a lack of legal grounds to contest the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">arrest</a> [JURIST reports]. Also, in June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging various violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and arguing that her charges were politically engineered by current Ukrainian president and long-time political rival <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website]. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the presidential election in March 2010, but Tymoshenko has claimed that widespread voter fraud contributed to the outcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the 52-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2011/12/14/no-way-live">report</a> [materials], "No Way to Live: Alabama's Immigrant Law," HRW claims that the law is denying immigrants equal protection under the law as well as access to basic necessities such as water, electricity and housing. HRW argues that children have been particularly affected. According to the report:<blockquote>The initial human impact has been devastating, though the full consequences remain unclear. A group of people have found themselves unable to live the lives they had lived for many years. Some were barred from access to basic services like water, and many more were told they could not live in homes they own. The interpretation of some provisions continues to be modified by state officials or enjoined by the courts, but other provisions still deny unauthorized immigrants equal protection of the law. This has already discouraged some from reporting crimes and wage theft. Particularly hard hit have been the children of unauthorized immigrants, an especially vulnerable population, including the many who are US citizens. Legislators contend that these are "unintended consequences" of the legislation, but the proponents of the Alabama law made clear from the start their intention to make it impossible for unauthorized immigrants to live in the state.</blockquote>HRW recommends an immediate repeal of the law and for the US Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

<p>Last week, Alabama <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] announced that he would work with lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/alabama-governor-working-to-revise-state-immigration-law.php">make the law more effective</a> [JURIST report]. Bentley assured that there were no plans to repeal the law, even with <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-block-alabama-immigration-law.php">pending challenges</a> [JURIST report] from the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. Earlier this month Alabama <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Attorney General Luther Strange</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/jurist-alabama-attorney-general-luther.php">suggested repealing specific provisions</a> [JURIST report] of the state's controversial immigration law which criminalize the failure of illegal immigrants to carry registration documents and require public schools to collect information regarding the immigration status of their students. Both these provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in October by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website].

Former chief election official, Benjamin Abalos, surrendered and was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/world/asia/philippines-arrests-former-official-accused-of-election-fraud.html">taken into custody</a> [NYT report] at a courthouse in the city of Manila, but maintains his innocence. It is alleged that Abalos assisted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria MacapagalArroyo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gloria+arroyo">news archive</a>] in rigging the Mindanao congressional elections. Arroyo was officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-charged-with-corruption-election-fraud.php">charged with electoral sabotage</a> [JURIST report] in November. However, she continues to <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Philippines-arrests-ex-president-in-hospital-room-2275314.php">deny wrongdoing</a> [AP report] and contends that the charges reflect political persecution by the government. As Abalos is only one of several officials accused of illegal activities in connection with this election, more arrests are expected.  Abalos is expected to be assigned to a detention center in the upcoming days.

<p>The country has experienced widespread political corruption in recent years, but current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino III</a> [BBC profile] has pledged to continue the anti-corruption efforts, which have been specifically focused on Arroyo and those connected to her. Earlier this week, the Philippine Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-chief-justice-impeached.php">voted to impeach</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/justices/j.corona.php">Chief Justice Renato Corona</a> [official profile] for violating the constitution and the public trust in connection with the trial of Arroyo, who originally appointed Corona to the Supreme Court. The impeachment proceedings required at least 95 signatures to move forward, and, ultimately, 188 of the 284 members of congress voted to impeach Corona. There are <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/12/12/11/summary-impeachment-complaint-vs-cj-corona">eight charges</a> [text] brought against Corona, including failure to disclose his personal finances and several allegations of partiality. The most high profile of the allegations includes a charge of partiality regarding the trial of Arroyo. It is alleged Corona <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">granted the temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] on the travel restriction of Arroyo without legal grounds in order to give her a chance to escape. The charges will now be brought to trial. If found guilty, Corona will likely be forced out of office. Corona is the first Chief Justice and Justice of the Supreme Court to be impeached, and because impeachment is a constitutional tool that is to be used only in instances involving "criminality or substantial abuse of power," a <a href="/sidebar/2011/12/edsel-tupaz-impeachment.php"> clear cut conviction is required</a> [JURIST op-ed] in order to preserve the integrity of both the country's Congress and Supreme Court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking at the <a href="http://www.lbjlibrary.org/">Lyndon Baines Johnson Library &#38; Museum</a> [website] in Austin, Texas, Holder stressed the importance of the right to vote, calling it the "cornerstone of our system of government." He expressed concern over several recently enacted state laws currently under review by the Justice Department that could infringe on this fundamental right. Holder said:<blockquote>Since January, more than a dozen states have advanced new voting measures. Some of these new laws are currently under review by the Justice Department, based on our obligations under the Voting Rights Act. Texas and South Carolina, for example, have enacted laws establishing new photo identification requirements that we&#8217;re reviewing. We're also examining a number of changes that Florida has made to its electoral process, including changes to the procedures governing third-party voter registration organizations, as well as changes to early voting procedures, including the number of days in the early voting period.  

<p>Although I cannot go into detail about the ongoing review of these and other state-law changes, I can assure you that it will be thorough&#8212;and fair. We will examine the facts, and we will apply the law. If a state passes a new voting law and meets its burden of showing that the law is not discriminatory, we will follow the law and approve the change. And where a state can't meet this burden, we will object as part of our obligation under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</blockquote>Holder also highlighted three areas in need of reform: deceptive election practices, neutrality in redistricting efforts and modernizing voter registration.</p>

<p>In October, the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> [advocacy website] reported that several new US state election laws that become effective in 2012 may make it <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/new-election-laws-may-make-voting-more-difficult-report.php">harder for some qualified voters to cast their ballots</a> [JURIST report]. The report indicates that as many as five million voters may be affected by the changes and may find it significantly harder to vote in 2012. The study examined the five broad categories of new election laws: those that require voters show photo identification to vote, those that require proof of citizenship to register to vote, those that make it harder to register to vote by eliminating same day voter registration, those that reduce early and absentee voting and those that make it harder for convicted felons to restore their voting rights. Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Wisconsin's new voter identification requirement. Last week, the US Supreme Court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">rule on the Texas redistricting dispute</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was filed by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] in 2005 after the FDA failed to respond to a 2001 petition to make Plan B available over the counter (OTC) to women under 18, which it eventually denied in 2006. Judge Edward Korman <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 that the FDA must make Plan B available to 17-year-olds without a prescription and reconsider whether the contraceptive should be available over the counter (OTC) to women under the age of 17. When the FDA did not take action, the CRR asked the court to hold the agency in contempt. On Monday, the FDA issued a decision not to make Plan B available OTC to women under 17. At a hearing that had already been scheduled for Tuesday, Korman decided not to hold the FDA in contempt but did allow the CRR to <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2011/12_-_December/Plan_B_legal_fight_revived_in_Brooklyn_federal_court/">reopen its lawsuit</a> [Reuters report]. The CRR announced Tuesday that it <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-prepares-new-legal-challenge-to-lift-fda-restrictions-on-e">plans to move forward</a> [press release] with its challenge.

<p>Tuesday's ruling comes just days after Department of <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Health and Human Services</a> [official website] Director Kathleen Sebelius <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/12/20111207a.html">blocked an FDA recommendation</a> [press release] to make Plan B available OTC to women under 17. Sebelius' decision, based on concerns for the lack of data on the effects for young women, was backed by US President Barack Obama. Also Tuesday, a group of 15 US Senators <a href="http://murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=77e3d54b-bb6b-4c7c-9f05-bfe8c8d3b304">wrote to Sebelius</a> [text] expressing disappointment and seeking the specific rationale and data that went into the decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court overturned several of his convictions but affirmed his convictions for genocide and crimes against humanity. The ICTR also reduced the life sentence of <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=15&mnid=3">Anatole Nsengiyumva</a> [ICTR materials] to 15 years, reversing several of his convictions. He was released for time served. Bagosora served a senior official in the Rwandan Ministry of Defence, and Nsengiyumya was the Commander of the Gisenyi Operational Sector.

<p>Last week, top officials of the ICTR and the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] told the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-war-crimes-tribunals-report-progress-to-security-council.php">international cooperation</a> [JURIST report] in tracking and arresting fugitives is vital to completion of the tribunals' mandates. This year saw the arrests of the last two remaining fugitives wanted by the ICTY, but nine fugitives sought by ICTR have continued to escape capture, three of whom are among the most high-ranking of the accused. ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow called on the Member States of the Great Lakes Conference to provide information and aid in the apprehension of the remaining fugitives, as the trial work of the ICTR is due to be finished by the end of the second quarter of 2012, with appeals work finished by early 2014. Last month the two presidents told the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] that the tribunals are <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/staff-shortages-burdening-un-war-crimes-tribunals-ictr.php">in need of experienced staff to complete their work</a> [JURIST report], warning of the difficulties in retaining staff at the ICTY and the ICTR because both tribunals are nearing the end of their work and employees are leaving for more permanent jobs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from his time as mayor of the city of Paris and accused him of using public funds to support his political ambitions. In September, the prosecution asked the court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/france-prosecutor-seeks-acquittal-in-chirac-corruption-case.php">drop all charges against Chirac</a> [JURIST report] and his nine co-defendants. Two of the nine were acquitted, but the other seven were also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16194089">found guilty</a> [BBC report]. Chirac, who was absent from much of his trial due to failing health, was <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2011/12/15/verdict-attendu-dans-l-affaire-des-emplois-fictifs-de-la-ville-de-paris_1618652_3224.html#ens_id=1618653">not present</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French] for Thursday's verdict. The first former French president to face prosecution, Chirac could have faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. It is unclear whether he plans to appeal.

<p>While the verdict brings an end to this particular trial, Chirac still faces other legal woes. In September the prosecutor's office <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/jurist-the-paris-prosecutors-office.php">began an inquiry into allegations</a> [JURIST report] against Chirac and his prime minister Dominique de Villepin over the receipt of millions of dollars from African leaders. The accusations against the two former French officials were made by a lawyer who worked as an aide to Chirac and claims to have participated in the passage of over $20 million in cash from African leaders to be used as political donations. All of the alleged donations came from leaders of former French colonies. An investigation has also been launched by the Paris Bar into the actions taken by the accuser as his involvement with the passage of these funds is unethical within the legal profession. Villepin, like Chirac, had also been the subject of another trial, which involved accusations that he participated in a smear campaign against current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French], but was recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-court-acquits-ex-pm-of-sarkozy.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The about face comes after revisions by lawmakers that address the concerns of the Obama administration related to the treatment of terror suspects. The administration had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/obama-threatens-veto-of-defense-spending-bill-over-detainee-provision.php">threatened to veto the legislation</a> [JURIST report] because it would require military rather than civilian detention of terror suspects. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/congress-reaches-agreement-on-controversial-defense-bill.php">revised version of the bill</a> [JURIST report], released by the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/home">House</a> and <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committees</a> [official websites] on Monday, gives the administration more discretion over the laws implementation and grants waiver authority to the president. White House press secretary Jay Carney said that because of the changes, "we have concluded that the language does not challenge or constrain the President's ability to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the American people, and the President's senior advisors will not recommend a veto." The bill passed in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] with a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll932.xml">283 to 136</a> [roll call]. The bill is expected to pass in the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] sometime Thursday.

<p>The news marks the end of the contentious debate surrounding passage of the annual defense spending bill. The version of the bill containing the controversial terrorism provision <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-with-controversial-detainee-provision.php">passed in the Senate</a> [JURIST report] early this month. Also this month, the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-rejects-amendment-to-detainee-provision-in-defense-spending-bill.php">rejected an amendment to the bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have struck a provision authorizing the president to use "all necessary and appropriate force" to detain individuals suspected of terrorism and instituted a timeline to allow further study and investigation on the issue of counterterrorism by Congress. The terrorism provision was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by the Senate Armed Services Committee in a unanimous vote after disagreements regarding the provision had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/politics/senate-terror-detainees/">blocked their passage for months</a> [CNN report]. The passage by the Committee came shortly after an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">report</a> [PDF] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court reduced the three-year sentence of blogger Maikel Nabil to two years. Nabil was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-military-court-convicts-blogger-for-insulting-army.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to prison in April for criticizing the Egyptian army and raising questions over reform in the wake of revolution. The 25-year-old blogger and activist was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/11/egypt-blogger-s-3-year-sentence-blow-free-speech">arrested</a> [HRW report] at his home on March 28 and charged with "insulting the military establishment" and "spreading false information" for criticizing the army's handling of the revolution that began on January 25. He <a href="http://www.maikelnabil.com/2011/03/blog-post_07.html">posted an article on his blog</a> [text, in Arabic] on March 7 saying the army had beat, tortured and killed protesters, including some who were cooperating with security forces. He was sentenced without a formal hearing and without his lawyers present. Nabil has been on a hunger strike since August in protest of his conviction. His family reports that he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16184686">plans to escalate his hunger strike</a> [BBC report] despite the courts reduction of his sentence causing serious concerns for his already deteriorating health.

<p>The blogger's conviction has raised doubts about the military's commitment to reform after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6045958.stm">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] stepped down. In March, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder] unveiled an interim constitution that allows the council to retain control over the country until an elected government is installed. The document <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8953/Egypt/Politics-/Armed-Forces-announces-Egypts-interim-Constitution.aspx">vests the military council with presidential powers</a> [Al-Ahram report], including the abilities to introduce legislation, veto existing laws and act as Egypt's representative to the international community. Last November, Egypt released blogger <a href="http://www.freekareem.org/">Abdel Kareem Nabil</a> [advocacy website] after four years of imprisonment on charges of insulting Islam and causing sectarian strife on his <a href="http://karam903.blogspot.com/">blog</a> [website, in Arabic]. Nabil, a former law student, was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-blogger-sentenced-to-prison-for.php">convicted in 2007</a> [JURIST report] for posting statements critical of Islamic authorities and former president Mubarak, calling him a dictator.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZCu1u03ygz1gclk4h3KFXazf0vQ?docId=CNG.d1c14754f585e752b4e73771c6fc1b86.241">restricts journalists</a> [AFP report] from undermining Algeria's sovereignty, national identity, economy and security, providing for fines up to USD $3,900 and jail time. The law has been criticized for being vague and overbroad by groups such as the <a href="http://www.la-laddh.org/">Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights</a> [advocacy website, in French]. Algerian <a href="http://www.ministerecommunication.gov.dz/">Minister of Communication Nacer Mehal</a> [official website, in French] <a href="http://www.radioalgerie.dz/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12314:2011-12-15-14-11-59&catid=56:2010-05-13-10-29-46&Itemid=109">defended the measure</a> [Radio Algerienne report, in Arabic], saying it would not restrict free expression.

<p>In April, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Frank LaRue</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-expert-urges-algeria-to-guarantee-freedom-of-expression.php">called on Algeria</a> [JURIST report] to "guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression" including decriminalizing defamation. LaRue noted that, despite significant progress since the 1990s, which saw more than 100 journalists killed, a number of challenges remain. LaRue highlighted that the television and radio sectors remain under government control and do not provide unbiased coverage. He also cautioned that the restrictive legal framework continues to impair important rights including peaceful assembly. Earlier that month, Algerian <a href="http://www.el-mouradia.dz/francais/president/biographie/Presidentfr.htm">President Abdelaziz Bouteflika</a> [official profile, in French] declared an initiative for <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/algeria-president-announces-constitutional-reforms-amid-political-protests.php">sweeping constitutional and political reforms</a> [JURIST report] in order to increase the role of democracy in the African nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 2009 law, which allows death row inmates to appeal their sentences based on statistical evidence of racism, was designed to address concerns that racial bias plays a role in sentencing. In an accompanying <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2011/s9Veto/letter.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF], Perdue said that while she is a strong supporter of the death penalty, "it is essentially that it be carried out fairly and that the process not be infected with prejudice based on race, gender, poverty, or any other factor." Perdue said, "I am vetoing Senate Bill 9 for the same reason that I signed the Racial Justice Act two years ago: it is simply unacceptable for racial prejudice to play a role in the imposition of the death penalty in North Carolina.

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue across the US. Last month Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber issued a temporary reprieve for death row inmate Gary Haugen and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/oregon-governor-puts-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to the state's death penalty. Earlier that month the <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/connecticut-high-court-upholds-states-death-penalty-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's death penalty law. Also in November the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it was forming a committee to ensure that the death penalty is <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">not administered arbitrarily</a> [JURIST report]. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois abolished capital punishment</a> [JURIST report], concluding that there was no way to rid the capital punishment system of its discriminatory flaws. In 2009, New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">repealed its death penalty</a> [JURIST report] on similar grounds to Illinois, asserting that the state could not possibly administer the death penalty impartially.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These allegations are detailed in an <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2011/12/15/all-means-necessary">88-page report</a> [text] based on more than 60 interviews with defectors from the Syrian military and intelligence agencies who describe, in specific detail, how numerous commanders and officials at various levels of the Syrian government ordered attacks against Syrian civilians. As a result of the alleged abuses, HRW has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/103573">urged</a> [press release] the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites], as well as impose sanctions against the 74 officials implicated in the attacks. According to Anna Neistat, associate director for emergencies at HRW and one of the authors of the report, "Defectors gave us names, ranks, and positions of those who gave the orders to shoot and kill, and each and every official named in this report, up to the very highest levels of the Syrian government, should answer for their crimes against the Syrian people." One former soldier, who was deployed to Daraa with the 35th Special Forces Regiment, told HRW that his commander verbally ordered him to open fire at protestors on April 25:
<blockquote>The commander of our regiment, Brigadier General Ramadan Ramadan, usually stayed behind the lines. But this time he stood in front of the whole brigade. He said, "Use heavy shooting. Nobody will ask you to explain." Normally we are supposed to save bullets, but this time he said, "Use as many bullets as you want." And when somebody asked what we were supposed to shoot at, he said, "At anything in front of you." About 40 protesters were killed that day.</blockquote>While HRW has consistently characterized the ongoing abuses in Syria as crimes against humanity, the Syrian government has repeatedly defended its actions as a matter of necessity, arguing that armed terrorist groups have incited Syrian violence and are ultimately responsible for the uprising that began there last March.

<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-again-urges-security-council-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">previously urged</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">refer the situation in Syria to the ICC</a> [press release]. She has reported that more than 5,000 people, including 300 children, have been killed in Syria since the start of the protests in March, and that many of the killings, detentions, and acts of torture qualify, <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/12/un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-navi-pillay-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-syria-and-gaza-security-council-media-stakeout.html">in her view</a> [video], as crimes against humanity. Pillay has also called on the Syrian government to allow human rights monitors into the country and to cooperate fully with the investigations. Earlier this month, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">strongly condemning the recent violence</a> [JURIST report] in Syria.

Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. The charges against Anwar allege that he sodomized a former male political aide. This is the second sodomy case launched against Anwar, who has consistently argued that the allegations are a politically motivated attempt to silence the opposition. He took the stand in August to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-denies-charges-at-sodomy-trial.php">deny the charges</a>, and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar-defense-rests-in-sodomy-trial.php">defense rested its case</a> [JURIST reports] in October. The verdict is scheduled to be delivered January 9.

<p>A Malaysian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malaysia-high-court-finds-sodomy-case-against-opposition-leader-anwar-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that prosecutors had enough evidence to continue to pursue a sodomy case against Anwar. The opposition leader was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">accuser</a> [JURIST reports] in late June. Last December, Anwar filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. Last year, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected Anwar's 2006 defamation suit</a> [JURIST report] against against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] for allegedly suggesting at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. Anwar was Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There were 43 executions in 13 states in 2001, down from 46 executions in 2011. The report noted that <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois abolished the death penalty</a> in 2011 and that Oregon's governor <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/oregon-governor-puts-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">put a moratorium on executions</a> [JURIST reports] in that state. The DPIC also pointed to the huge public outcry over the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/georgia-executes-troy-anthony-davis-after-supreme-court-denies-stay.php">execution of Georgia inmate Troy Davis</a> [JURIST report] as evidence of Americans' waning support of the death penalty. According to the report, the death penalty system in the US remains flawed:<blockquote>In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases. The new system approved in 1976 was supposed to carefully guide prosecutors, juries, and judges in administering a more rational system. Today, the promise of a fair, sensible, and effective system of capital punishment has proven false. As distrust of the system has grown, the death penalty is again infrequently applied, and a host of arbitrary factors still strongly influences who lives and who dies.</blockquote>The trends are similar to those observed in the DPIC's <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-execution-rates-continue-to-drop-during-2010.php">2010 report</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue across the US. Earlier this week North Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-repeal-of-death-penalty-racial-justice-law.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have essentially repealed the state's <ahref="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S461v6.pdf">Racial Justice Act</a> [text, PDF]. The 2009 law, which allows death row inmates to appeal their sentences based on statistical evidence of racism, was designed to address concerns that racial bias plays a role in sentencing. Last month the <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/connecticut-high-court-upholds-states-death-penalty-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's death penalty law. Also in November the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it was forming a committee to ensure that the death penalty is <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">not administered arbitrarily</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009, New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">repealed its death penalty</a> [JURIST report] on similar grounds to Illinois, asserting that the state could not possibly administer the death penalty impartially.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] Monday to rule on a challenge to Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials], which criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said, "[t]he Arizona case will substantially affect many of the legal questions that are critical to Alabama's appeals pending in the 11th Circuit."

The report details LGBT people around the world being <a href-"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743&Cr=discrimination&Cr1=">killed or enduring hate-motivated violence</a> [UN News Centre report], torture, detention, criminalization and discrimination in jobs, health care and education because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Prepared in response to a request from the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] earlier this year, the report draws from information included in past UN reporting, official statistics on hate crimes where there are available, and reporting by regional organizations and some non-governmental organizations. The report finds that a more extensive study and regular reporting are required for a more comprehensive analysis, but concludes that:<blockquote>on the basis of the information presented herein, a pattern of human rights violations emerges that demands a response. Governments and inter-governmental bodies have often overlooked violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The mandate of the Human Rights Council requires it to address this gap: the Council should promote "universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner."</blockquote>According to the report, homophobic and transphobic violence has been recorded in every region of the world, LGBT people are often targets of organized abuse and violence against LGBT persons tends to be especially vicious compared to other bias-motivated crimes. Furthermore, violent incidents or acts of discrimination frequently go unreported because victims do not trust police, are afraid of reprisals or are unwilling to identify themselves as LGBT.

<p>The investigation and report were requested by the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [JURIST report], passed in June. The resolution is the first to call for an end to sexuality discrimination worldwide and to recognize it as a "priority" for the UN. The UN has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues, due to no international consensus on the morality of homosexuality. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. Two years ago, the UN passed a <A href = "http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/491-1.pdf">gay rights declaration</a> [text, PDF], which the <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">US signed and sponsored</a> [JURIST report]. The declaration, a nonbinding measure that does not have the full force of a resolution, called on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href = "http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. The year before, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement. As of the 2011 <a href = "http://ilga.org">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website] by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website], claims that the law is overly broad and criminalizes activity that is protected by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. According to the complaint:<blockquote>The AETA fails to define key terms, but its plain language criminalizes core political advocacy and speech that are protected by the First Amendment. For example, it punishes otherwise lawful and innocuous speech or advocacy that causes a business that uses or sells
animal products to lose profit, even where that lost profit comes from a decrease in sales in reaction to public advocacy. Thus, AETA effectively criminalizes the very purpose of the First Amendment&#8212;changing people's minds. ... The law is also uncommonly broad, insofar as it defines an "animal enterprise" to
include almost any business that buys or sells animal products. As such, it insulates a large number of businesses from the types of criticism that are deeply rooted in our constitutional tradition.</blockquote>The plaintiffs claim that fear of prosecution has stopped them from engaging in lawful activism.

<p>The AETA was signed into law by then-president George W. Bush in 2006, replacing the 1992 Animal Enterprise Protection Act. Supporters claim that the law contains adequate First Amendment protections. The law has rarely been used over the past five years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontimmigration.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] Thursday announced the findings of its three-year civil rights investigation of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO). The investigation concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/opa/pr/speeches/2011/crt-speech-111215.html">MCSO engages in a pattern or practice of violating the Constitution</a> [DOJ press release] and laws of the US in three areas. First, the DOJ found that the MCSO engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional policing, specifically in racial profiling of Latinos and in the unlawful stops, detains and arrests resulting therefrom. Next, the DOJ found that the MCSO unlawfully retaliates against people who criticize its policies and practices. Finally, the DOJ found reasonable cause to believe that the MCSO operates its jails in a manner that discriminates against Latino inmates that are limited-English-proficient, routinely punishing Latino inmates that are limited-English-proficient when they fail to understand commands given in English, and denying critical services that are provided to other inmates. Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez made the findings announcement, criticizing the MCSO for failing to cooperate with requests for information, which caused the investigation to to take longer than expected. Perez concluded,<blockquote>The problems identified in our letter of findings are very serious. They affect public safety, officer safety on the street and in the jail, and they implicate important constitutional protections. Effective policing and constitutional policing go hand in hand. Other departments have recognized this, and we are working collaboratively with us to address important issues. ... If collaboration again proves elusive, we will not hesitate to take prompt, appropriate legal action.</blockquote>The investigation found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the culture of the department, one that breeds a systemic disregard for basic constitutional protections, the problems of which are compounded by the MCSO's penchant for retaliation against people who speak out against them. The DOJ is also reviewing allegations that the MCSO has failed to investigate a large number of sex crimes.

<p>The role of local law enforcement has garnered much focus in recent years, especially in the area of immigration control, since the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passage</a> [JURIST report] of the infamous <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], which led to passage of similar enforcement laws in other states. Critics of these laws call them "racial profiling" laws or, more aptly, "show me your papers" laws because they require all immigrants to carry their documents with them at all times for production on demand by state law enforcement officers. In November <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/fac/hu">Margaret Hu</a> [official profile] of Duke University School of Law <a href="/forum/2011/11/margaret-hu-immigration-papers.php">wrote</a> [JURIST commentary] that the recently enacted state-level immigration laws go against long-held American ideals and cultural values. The DOJ has now challenged the constitutionality of three state immigration laws, those of <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a> [JURIST reports] and South Carolina. In September 2010 more than 500 international, US, state and local human rights and immigration advocacy organizations sent a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-groups-urge-obama-to-halt-use-of-local-authorities-in-immigration-enforcement.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to US President Barack Obama expressing concern over the use of local law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of federal immigration law, specifically pointing to the MCSO and an example of an authority with a history of racial profiling. In October 2008 an Arizona federal district court ruled that conditions in Maricopa County corrections facilities <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-declares-arizona-county.php">violate the constitutional rights of its prisoners</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mbarushimana was allegedly tied to the murder, rape and torture of Congolese villagers by Hutu militia in 2009. He was accused of being the Executive Secretary of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda</a> (FDLR) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] since 2007. The Pre-Trial Chamber found that evidence presented during the preliminary hearing in September was not strong enough to send the case to trial. The prosecution <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F9C62A71-1D37-4E8B-B895-D5A71047DD60/0/doc1291052.pdf">appealed</a> [petition, PDF] the decision Friday:<blockquote>In order to prevent irreparable prejudice to the Prosecution, it is requested that the Pre-trial Chamber stays its order on release until such time as it has ruled on the Prosecution's application for leave to appeal or, if leave is granted, until the Appeals Chamber rules on the request for suspensive effect. The Prosecution reminds the Pre-Trial Chamber that according to its own findings, endorsed by the Appeals Chamber, Callixte Mbarushimana, if released, has the means to interfere with the investigation, to commit crimes, and to abscond, with the financial support of the FDLR's international network.</blockquote>The ICC is expected to rule on the appeal soon. 

<p>Mbarushimana was ordered to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/france-court-orders-rwanda-rebel-leader-to-face-icc-trial.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] at The Hague by a French court in 2010. In 2008 he was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/rwanda-war-crimes-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Germany trying flee to Russia. In 2005, the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/un-to-ask-france-to-bring-case-against.php">UN asked France</a> [JURIST report] to bring charges against Mbarushimana, who was living with refugee status in the country.

The LLRC was created by the Sri Lankan government in 2010 to investigate 2009 events in which civilians were killed. In compiling the report, the LLRC invited representatives of the public and got the majority of its information from the general public. It concluded that the events did not seem to be intentional attacks by Sri Lanka Security Forces against civilians who were injured or killed but still recommended possible punishment for misconduct and compensation to those injured in specific situations. It also stressed the importance of realizing the political actions that brought about the conflict in the first place:<blockquote>The process of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society, of both Sinhala and Tamil communities. The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people. The Tamil political leaders were equally responsible for this conflict which could have been avoided had the Tamil leaders refrained from promoting an armed campaign towards secession.</blockquote>It also recommended a National Day be appointed to "express solidarity and empathy with all victims of the tragic conflict."

<p>In November, the Sri Lankan government announced it would begin <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Sri-Lanka-investigating-civilian-casualties-from-civil-war.php">investigating the number of casualties</a> [JURIST report] from its 26-year civil war with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> [JURIST news archive].

The <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-blocks-enforcement-of-nebraska-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010 against the law, known as the Women's Health Protection Act, which requires physicians to evaluate patients to determine that their choice to have an <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] is voluntary and to <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB594.pdf">inform the patients of all risk factors and complications</a> [LB 594 text, PDF] that have been statistically associated with abortion and published in peer-reviewed journals 12 months prior to the pre-abortion evaluation, as well as earlier studies. The district court ruled that the law was unconstitutional. <a href="http://nebraskansunitedforlife.org/">Nebraskans United for Life</a> (NuLife) [advocacy website] asked for a motion to reconsider, which was denied, and they subsequently appealed. The Eighth Circuit refused to reconsider the motion based on its timeliness, holding, "[t]he record demonstrates the district court considered the proper factors, including the fact the litigation was terminated procedurally, NuLife failed to justify its delay in light of its prior knowledge of the case, and the parties would be prejudiced because final judgment of their settlement had already been entered." Given their holding, they did not reach a decision on the alternative bases for the appeal. 

<p>In August 2010 Nebraska <a href="http://www.ago.ne.gov/index.htm">Attorney General Jon Bruning</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/nebraska-ag-agrees-to-permanent-injunction-of-state-abortion-law.php">agree to a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the Nebraska law because he believed there was little chance that the law would withstand a court challenge.

Proponents of the bill argue that it will allow the government to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/16/indonesia-infrastructure-idUSL3E7NG0MN20111216">increase infrastructure</a> [Reuters report], leading to improvements in the economy. A day after the bill passed, <a href="http://www.fitchratings.com/web/en/dynamic/fitch-home.jsp">Fitch Ratings</a> [official website] upgraded Indonesia to an investment grade rating. Human rights groups argue that the land acquisition bill threatens notions of traditional lands rights and will lead to conflict between land owners and the government.

<p>Eminent domain has become an issue in many members of the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> [official website] recently due to their <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/26/economic-boom-%E2%80%98democratic-recession%E2%80%99-asean.html">improving economies</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report]. However, controversy surrounds the governments' expanding use of their powers to seize land from indigenous people. In September Malaysia's Federal Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-court-rules-against-indigenous-people-in-land-rights-suit.php">ruled unanimously against</a> [JURIST report] indigenous people fighting against the Sarawak government's seizure of land to build a USD $2.3 billion dam project. In December, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">pledged to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [JURIST report], a non-binding UN treaty expressing support for the rights of indigenous peoples. The US was the last member to lend its support to the treaty. In August 2010, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the living conditions of indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report] and support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Daqduq allegedly has links to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> [JURIST news archive] and is accused of planning a raid in 2007 which resulted in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/world/middleeast/us-transfers-last-prisoner-to-iraqi-government.html?_r=1">deaths of five US soldiers</a> [NYT report].

Since no decision could be reached, Duqdaq had to be transferred to Iraq officials pursuant to the 2008 status-of-forces agreement between the US and Baghdad. The decision to turn over Duqdaq will likely spark political controversy, because many politicians were <a href="mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=58d62902-c347-49f1-bfed-255e1527adc7">concerned with releasing Duqdaq</a> [letter, PDF] to Iraqi authorities:<blockquote>If [Duqdaq] is released from custody, we firmly believe that he will seek to harm or kill more American servicemen and women. Our concern is that Iraq's current legal regime could allow for Daqduq to to return to the fight either as a result of an inability to detain and prosecute him under Iraqi criminal laws, ineffective incarceration, or other challenges. We know that matters such as these remain the subject of ongoing discussions with our Iraqi partners, but we believe that the potential transfer of Daqduq to Iraqi authority could pose an unacceptable risk to US national security interests.</blockquote>Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki stated that Iraq could not allow the Daqduq to be transferred to the US because current Iraqi law did not permit it. It is currently unclear whether the administration will still seek to have Daqduq extradited eventually to be tried on US soil or to be tried under a <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>The location of the trials of foreign terror suspects detained by the US has been a controversial issue. In July the US brought Somali terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame to the US to face a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/us-brings-somali-terror-suspect-to-new-york-for-civil-trial.php">civil trial in New York</a> [JURIST report], a decision that has sparked harsh criticism from members of Congress who argued that terror suspects should be held at Guantanamo Bay. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-orders-resumption-of-guantanamo-military-trials.php">ordered military commissions of detainees to resume</a> [JURIST report] in March after he initially suspended new charges at Guantanamo Bay shortly after taking office in 2009. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts despite finding little support from Congress. In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">wanted the accused be tried before a federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">imposed a series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ictr-transfers-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">ordered the transfer</a> [JURIST report] in June under Rule 11 <em>bis</em>, which authorizes the transfer of cases to appropriate national jurisdictions. This marked the first time the ICTR had transferred a case to the Rwandan court system. As a precautionary measure, the Referral Chamber requested that the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/news_en.html">African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> (ACHPR) [official website] be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40772&Cr=Rwanda&Cr1=">appointed to oversee the trial</a> [UN News Centre report] and present any issues to the ICTR President as they arise.

Uwinkindi was <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/Court%20Documents/ICTR/Uwinkindi_Indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] by the ICTR in 2001 and has been charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. The indictment alleges that Uwinkindi collaborated with the extremist National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in order to kill Tutsis. He allegedly led a group of Hutus to look for and kill a group of Tutsi settlers and conspired with members of the militia to kill Tutsis who sought protection in the church where he was the pastor. According to the indictment, approximately 2,000 bodies were found near the church where the violence occurred. Uwinkindi had been one of the ICTR's most wanted suspects, with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/10486173.stm">$5 million reward being offered</a> [BBC report] for information leading to his capture.

AI warned that reports indicate the exchange in power could forecast new repressions to "crush any possibility of dissent." Indeed, there are allegations that the government has "purged" any official opposed to Kim Jong-un's succession, by execution or labor camp internment. Not much is known about Kim Jong-un, who is 27 or 28 and Kim Jong-il's youngest son, except that he was recently appointed head of the National Defence Commission and will head his father's funeral committee. North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong-il died early Saturday morning:
<p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gewq-TxP8QE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Although images from the country center around a grief-stricken populace, AI and others have criticized Kim Jong-il's regime as damaging to the nation, citing that nearly a million people have died of food shortages since he took power in 1994. Kim Jong-il reportedly died of "great physical and mental strain" while "dedicating his life to his people." An autopsy revealed more specifically that the 69-year-old died of <a href = "http://www.kcna.co.jp/calendar/2011/12/12-19/2011-1219-032.html">heart failure</a> [KCNA report, in Korean]. There has been speculation that Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke several years ago, as well as a continuing struggle with diabetes, which it is alleged Kim Jong-un shares. A national mourning period has been declared until December 29. Reactions to Kim Jong-il's death have been <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16239940">varied</a> [BBC report]. South Korea and Japan are on high alert for the possibility of a strike by North Korea in the wake of his passing, and Asian stock markets have fallen since the death of North Korea's "Dear Leader."</p>

<p>North Korea under Kim Jong-il was alleged to be one of the <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/north-korea">most notorious violators of human rights in the world</a> [HRW report]. The UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights Marzuki Darusman criticized North Korea's human rights record last month, especially <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">concerning treatment of prisoners</a> [JURIST report], echoing a <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/gashc4032.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] earlier that week. North Korea has refused to admit agents of the UN to gather information and denies that labor camps exist. Last year, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] confirmed that the prosecutor's office has opened preliminary examinations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-examines-possible-war-crimes-charges-against-north-korea.php">evaluate possible war crimes committed by North Korea</a> [JURIST report]. ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] verified that evaluations will determine if some of the incidents by North Korean forces in South Korea constitute war crimes, giving the ICC jurisdiction over the matter. Earlier in 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-committee-condemns-north-korea-rights-violations.php">UN committee condemned</a> [JURIST report] what it called persistent, "grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights" of its own people. In March 2010, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 2011 figures for January through June were compiled by the Bureau's <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis">Criminal Justice Information Services</a> (CJIS) [official website] in a <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/preliminary-annual-ucr-jan-jun-2011">preliminary semiannual report</a> [text].

The FBI report did not give any reason for the decrease in crimes nationwide, but the latest numbers provide further evidence of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/us-usa-crime-fbi-idUSTRE7BI0ZR20111219">no crime spike coinciding with tough economic conditions</a> [Reuters report] and high unemployment.

<p>The FBI data is a compilation of more than 18,000 jurisdictions that voluntarily participate in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. The report for <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fbi-reports-decrease-in-violent-crime-for-fourth-straight-year.php">2010</a> showed a decrease of 6.0 percent in violent crime and a decrease of 2.7 percent in property crime compared to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/fbi-report-shows-decrease-in-us-violent-crime-for-third-straight-year.php">2009 statistics</a> [JURIST reports]. The decrease in violent crime began after <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-violent-crimes-up-in-2006-for-second.php">2006</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/fbi-reports-first-increase-in-violent.php">2005 statistics</a> [JURIST reports] showed an increase of 1.3 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. Property crime has decreased for its eighth consecutive year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Legal action charity <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a>, in cooperation with the human rights organization <a href="http://www.access-info.org/">Access Info Europe</a> [advocacy websites], <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2011_12_19_PUB_Rendition_on_Record_published.pdf">released their interim findings</a> [report; <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_12_19_rendition_on_the_record/">press release</a>] in a report documenting right of access requests made in 28 countries to investigate flights associated with "extraordinary rendition"&#8212;the covert transfer of prisoners by the US from locations in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia. The report shows that only seven countries have provided information following right of access requests, with five other countries responding with claims that they do not hold the information requested, three countries and <a href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/">Eurocontrol</a> [official website] denying the requests outright and almost half of the total countries polled responding with administrative silence. The groups admonished the European countries that lagged in terms of transparency:<blockquote>The right of information is a fundamental right in itself, as has been recognised by the European Court of Human Rights and the UN  Human Rights Committee. It is also an instrumental right, essential for the protection of other human rights. Information concerning grave infringements of human rights should never be withheld from the public.</blockquote>The report found the US provided the most comprehensive response to the requests, having handed over <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) [official website] records with data on more than 27,000 flight segments. Canada, one of the countries to refuse the information requests, responded that its civil air navigation services provider is a private body that does not fall under the scope of Canada's access to information law and so is not required to provide information. The report claims that the 13 countries responding with administrative silence have violated the right of access to information and are "covering up the serious violations of the human rights of those who were the victims of extraordinary rendition."

<p>Many of the flights that are being investigated passed through Europe and in some cases the involuntary passengers they carried were allegedly held and tortured in detention centers in Europe. Earlier this month a joint investigation between the <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> (AP) [media website] and a German public television company reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/cia-operated-secret-prison-in-romania-ap-report.php">uncovered a CIA-operated secret prison</a> [JURIST report] outside the capital of Romania. The investigation found that once detainees were placed in the prisons, they endured sleep deprivation and other harsh interrogation techniques, but waterboarding was not allowed in Romania. Investigations have previously uncovered similar "black site" locations in Lithuania and Poland. The Lithuanian National Security Committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department provided the CIA with <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/lithuania-parliamentary-committee.php">two secret facilities</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. In 2007 it was discovered that the CIA had prisons in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/cia-operated-secret-prisons-in-poland.php">Romania and Poland</a> [JURIST report], but the governments would never confirm or deny the allegations. In 2010 Poland requested US assistance in their investigation of the alleged prison, but the US government refused to cooperate. The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/">European Parliament</a> [official website] approved a report condemning member states for cooperating with the (CIA) in operating illegal secret prisons and extraordinary rendition flights in Europe in 2007. This action came in the wake of a 2006 report by the Legal Affairs Committee of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> [official website] report that alleged that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/europe-rights-watchdog-says-cia.php">14 European countries</a> [JURIST report] collaborated with the CIA by taking an active or passive role in secret prisons and rendition flights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gao's sentence is the first <a href="http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1790418">sign that he is still alive</a> [AP report] since having disappeared 20 months ago, presumably at the hands of the authorities. The announcement was made in a brief report by the state-run Xinhua News Agency, but did not give information about his health and whereabouts, either now or in the passed 20 months, and did not explain what violations Gao had committed in violation of his five-year probation, which was scheduled to expire this Thursday. Gao was convicted of subversion in 2006 and sentenced to three years in prison, but he was quickly released on probation before he was taken away in 2009 in the first of his forced disappearances. He has been a prominent figure for the civil rights movement in China, advocating constitutional reform and arguing landmark cases to defend property rights and political and religious dissenters. Gao's wife and two children fled China around the time he first disappeared and now live in the US. She has said that Gao's family has yet to receive any notice about his case from the police or courts and have no knowledge of his current whereabouts.

<p>China's human rights record has been widely criticized. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] in June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to release protesters arrested for their Tiananmen Square involvement and account for those missing or killed during the suppression. The State Department also urged China to protect universal human rights afforded to peaceful dissenters, and to release those that had been detained or placed under house arrest in the months prior. In May, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Chinese rights activist and Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>]. Liu, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-awarded-nobel-peace-prize-in-absentia.php">awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize <em>in absentia</em></a>, is currently <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year prison term</a> [JURIST reports] after being convicted on charges of subversion in a trial that lasted only two hours and was closed to foreign diplomats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since Friday the brutal suppression of demonstrations has led to 11 deaths and more than 500 injuries. This is the second time since November that Pillay has condemned the use of excessive violence in Egypt. In November she issued a statement denouncing the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-egypt-violence.php">deaths of 30 protesters</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of security and military forces. She expressed particularly strong concern over what seems to be a deliberate targeting of peaceful women protesters.<blockquote>The graphic images of protesters, including women, being brutally clubbed and assaulted, long after the point when they are showing any resistance, are utterly shocking. People lying motionless on the ground are shown on film being smashed on the head and body with sticks. These are life-threatening and inhuman acts that cannot possibly be justified under the guise of restoration of security or crowd control.</blockquote>Pillay called for an independent and impartial investigation into the violence, citing that whoever has perpetrated these attacks must be brought to justice, no matter their rank or power. She also called for the release of all of the prisoners who have been jailed for exercising their rights. Pillay also had a message for protesters, urging them to continue to preserve the peaceful nature of their protests.

<p>Pillay's November declaration came after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a report highlighting the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-report-egypt-military-rulers-abused-protesters-violated-human-rights.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] committed by Egyptian authorities against protesters. That report expressed the concern that the rights violations under this new government maybe equal to those perpetrated under the Mubarak regime. In late November <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] and a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-experts-urge-restraint-in-egypt.php">group of independent human rights experts</a> [JURIST report] called on Egyptian authorities to guarantee the protection of human rights and civil liberties. The November clashes with armed forces were a result of more than 50,000 protesters taking the streets to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-protesters-decry-ruling-military-council-clash-with-police.php">criticize the military's continued control</a> over the country since the February <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST reports] of Hosni Mubarak. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rights groups had urged Hungary to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">amend</a> [JURIST report] the media law. The media law created the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media and Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the law, the government could impose costly fines on broadcasters, newspapers and news websites if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority. The Constitutional Court struck down provisions allowing the NMHH to regulate content in print and online media and limiting the rights of reporters to protect confidential sources. The Constitutional Court, in a separate decision, also <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/index.php?id=2011__december_19">struck down</a> [press release, in Hungarian] a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hungary-urged-to-revoke-church-law.php">regulating religious organizations</a> [JURIST report]. Critics of Hungarian <a href="http://www.orbanviktor.com/">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official website, in Hungarian] have expressed concern over his apparent attempts to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/hungary-legislation-idUSL6E7NJ31J20111219">limit check and balances on his power</a> [Reuters report].

<p>In April Hungarian President Pal Schmitt signed into law a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law-amid-rights-concerns.php">controversial new constitution</a> [JURIST report] amid concern from civil society leaders and opposition politicians that the document contravenes European human rights principles. According to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], the new constitution "enshrines discrimination," and jeopardizes the rights of people with disabilities, women and LGBT people. Changes in the new constitution included a debt ceiling, allowing the Fiscal Council to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March, defining marriage as a union between men and women and stating that the life of a fetus begins at and should be protected from conception. Hungary's parliament passed the new media law last December amid protests and criticism. The law took effect on January 1, 2011, the same day the Hungarian government assumed the presidency of the EU. Despite criticism, the Hungarian government initially <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-defends-controversial-media-law-in-face-of-eu-criticism.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the law. Under the new law, the NMHH can fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority, whose members are all loyal to the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Fidesz party</a> [party website, in Hungarian].

The USITC found that HTC had violated section 337 of the <a href="http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/trademarks/PreLanhamAct_088_Act_of_1930.pdf">Tarriff Act of 1930</a> [text, PDF] by infringing on some of the claims of patent nos. <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=5,946,647.PN.&OS=PN/5,946,647&RS=PN/5,946,647">5,946,647</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,343,263.PN.&OS=PN/6,343,263&RS=PN/6,343,263">6,343,263</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=5,481,721.PN.&OS=PN/5,481,721&RS=PN/5,481,721">5,481,721</a> and <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,275,983.PN.&OS=PN/6,275,983&RS=PN/6,275,983">6,275,983</a> [texts], all relating to signal processing and the transfer of data across data networks. Despite the victory for Apple, analysts state that this is <a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/12/apple-wins-itc-ruling-of-narrow.html">not a wholesale ban on the importation of HTC Android products</a> [FOSS Patents post]:<blockquote>[T]his ruling falls far short of anything that would force HTC out of the U.S. market in the near term. Also, out of ten patents originally asserted, Apple finally prevailed on only one. Apple will need a higher "hit rate" in the future, and it will have to enforce patents that are greatly more impactful than this one. Out of ten patents originally asserted, Apple finally managed to enforce one, and it's one of medium value.</blockquote>To avoid the import ban <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/index.html">Google</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US">backgrounder</a>], maker of the Android operating system, needs to either remove the feature, which would puts its phones at a competitive disadvantage, or find an alternate way of implementing it. Any HTC Android devices that avoid infringing on Apple's patents will not be subject to the importation ban, which is scheduled to begin April 19, 2012.

<p>In November the USITC found that Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-trade-commission-clears-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">did not violate</a> [JURIST report] four of HTC's patents. In July USITC ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">HTC infringed two Apple patents</a> [JURIST report] relating to the Android operating system. This ruling came days after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">Apple filed a complaint against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to bar importation of Samsung's smartphones and tablets. Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. This complaint came just weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung filed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to prevent Apple from importing iPads and iPhones. Samsung claimed Apple violated five patents also related to smartphones and tablets. In March 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">Apple also filed suit against HTC</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> [official website] for 10 patents involving various areas of technology.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The finding that the carbon emission fees do not violate international law, as several US and Canadian airlines had argued, was expected after ECJ Advocate General Juliane Kokott <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-court-advisor-supports-pollution-fines-against-foreign-airlines.php">issued an opinion to that effect</a> [JURIST report] in October. The foreign airlines had filed for judicial review of EU <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feur-lex.europa.eu%2FLexUriServ%2FLexUriServ.do%3Furi%3DOJ%3AL%3A2009%3A008%3A0003%3A0003%3AEN%3APDF&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Directive%202008%2F101%2FEC&amp;ei=zviNTuHRLuXi0QGntM0U&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3d0Crac_UfZfi7exS3odpWjAwog&amp;sig2=Pfb_AlcbjFFZ9ZjIxJY5Ng&amp;cad=rja">Directive 2008/101/EC</a> [text, PDF], which announced that airlines would have to comply with heightened emissions regulations while using EU airports beginning on January 1, 2012. The airlines argued that the directive violated the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcgill.ca%2Ffiles%2Fiasl%2Fchicago1944a.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Chicago%20Convention%20PDF&amp;ei=GfqNTsTdJerr0gHK2K0r&amp;usg=AFQjCNENIqGbClCYwzTk-wSlqss58ZJrHQ&amp;sig2=XM9RFDWQSRx1DIGo3UlFTg&amp;cad=rja">Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Fresource%2Fdocs%2Fconvkp%2Fkpeng.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Kyoto%20Protocol%20PDF&amp;ei=PfqNTsD-LaXj0QHlgpg0&amp;usg=AFQjCNHukaAxko7B3nIYwCKVLF2Le2JGdA&amp;sig2=sIy0HbXHMV_O8IdbDMyFHw&amp;cad=rja">Kyoto Protocol</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsa.gov%2Fgraphics%2Fogp%2FUS-EU_Transport_Agreement.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Open%20Skies%20Agreement%20PDF&amp;ei=Y_qNTvGMKon30gHtr_A1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuTesv_YvOQG3zZnHFSAhRQQqMYQ&amp;sig2=BjmxeDi7QO31r0HOtbYwRA&amp;cad=rja">Open Skies Agreement</a> [text, PDF]. However, the ECJ ruled that the directive does not violate the international agreements, noting that the EU is not a party to the Chicago Convention.

<p>The EU insisted that it will enforce its new cap-and-trade law <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-to-enforce-aircraft-emissions-law-despite-us-opposition.php">despite strong opposition from the US</a> [JURIST report]. The new legislation will eventually require all airlines, including those of non-EU countries, to pay for their carbon dioxide emissions in an effort to encourage airlines to use cleaner fuels and to economize fuel use. Those who do not comply would face steep fines. In October, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://transportation.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1428">voted to shield</a> [press release] US passenger and cargo planes from compliance with the EU law. The House <a href="http://transportation.house.gov/singlepages.aspx/803">Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica</a> [official profile] has criticized the law, calling it "an arbitrary and unjust violation of international law that disadvantages US air carriers, threatens US aviation jobs, and could close down direct travel from many central and western US airports to Europe" and a violation of international law and trade agreements. The change in the emissions law would greatly impact large US carriers, costing them an estimated $3 billion by 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court also found the pair bore extended liability for the widespread sexual assaults and rapes of Tutsi women and girls.  

<p>The ICTR continues to try suspects for crimes occurring during the massacre in which approximately 800,000 people were killed. Last month the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/former-mayor-of-rwanda-convicted-of-genocide-and-crimes-against-humanity.php">convicted former Rwandan mayor Gregoire Ndahimana</a> [JURIST report] of genocide and crimes against humanity by virtue of his "command responsibility" and sentenced him to 15 years in prison in connection with the killings at Nyange parish between April 6 and April 20, 1994, In September, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-acquits-former-ministers.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] two former Rwandan ministers, Casimir Bizimungu and Jerome Bicamumpaka, of genocide charges due to a lack of sufficient evidence. In June, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-ex-military-chief-bizimungu-3-others.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan army chief Augustin Bizimungu and three others. Bizimungu was sentenced to 30 years in prison while two others, Francois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu, to 20 years in prison and Augustin Ndindiliyimana to time served since his arrest in 2000. Last December the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ictr-convicts-former-military-officer-of-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan Armed Forces lieutenant Ildephonse Hategekimana to life imprisonment after convicting him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The court found Hategekimana guilty of three counts of genocide stemming from his involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, specifically in the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the Rwandan town of Butare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111221/170407320.html">council found fundamental violations in the investigation</a> [RIA Novosti report] leading to Khodorkovsky's second trial on embezzlement charges. In addition, the council indicated the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-21/khodorkovsky-conviction-should-be-quashed-kremlin-council-says.html">second conviction was for the same crime</a> [Bloomberg report] of which he was found guilty of in 2005. Describing the verdict as fictitious, council member and former Constitutional Court judge, Tamara Morshchakova, noted the council found <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iEAj5HIS6NpksLPtXGVj_iEiqx9Q?docId=e3f04ef76e76410f868e39b11371b745">neither evidence nor substance to the charges</a> [AP report] brought against Khodorkovsky in the second trial. The council's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16289603">decisions are non-binding</a> [BBC report] and have seldom elicited action from Russian authorities.  

<p>The council has spoken out about Khodorkovsky before. In July the council <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-rights-council-urges-amnesty-for-economic-crimes-would-cover-khodorkovsky.php">urged amnesty for economic crimes</a> [JURIST report] in a meeting with Medvedev that would include amnesty for the crimes of Khodorkovsky. Khodorkovsky and his former business partner Platon Lebedev were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December 2010 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] on charges connected with embezzling more than $27 billion from Yukos oil. International human rights organizations and numerous governments <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] following the guilty verdict. Last year former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href=/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky's opposition to Putin. In March 2010 Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">widespread reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In so ruling, the ECJ rebutted the presumption that member states observe the fundamental rights of asylum seekers. The ruling was the result of multiple cases brought before the court from individuals that were arrested in Greece for illegal entry without applying for asylum. Upon release, one traveled to the UK, while five others traveled to Ireland, where they were informed that they would be returned to Greece. However, fearing that their fundamental rights would be not be respected in Greece, they all resisted their return. The courts in the UK and Ireland then asked the ECJ to determine whether member states must first make sure that the state where those seeking asylum will be transferred actually observes fundamental rights. The ECJ ruled that they must, holding that:<blockquote>The Member States, including the national courts, may not transfer an asylum seeker to the Member State indicated as responsible where they cannot be unaware that systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers amount to substantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</blockquote>The court also stated that a member state that is not able to transfer an asylum seeker due to the possibility of infringement of their rights, may, in certain circumstances, be required to examine the application for asylum, which would normally be the responsibility of the state to which individuals are transferred. All of the transfers at issue would normally be allowed under an agreement called <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm">Dublin II</a> [text], which allows countries to deport an asylum seeker back to the country where they first set foot.

<p>Greece is not the only country whose asylum policies have been questioned. In May, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-australia-indigenous-asylum-policies.php">rebuked</a> [JURIST report] Australia for its political, rather than human rights based approach to indigenous people and asylum-seekers. Although she criticized some of the nation's practices, she had considerable praise for "a strong history of commitment to human rights at the international level, and also of course a robust system of democratic institutions." Nonetheless, she believes improvements are necessary in the realm of treatment of Aborigines and immigrants. On the topic of asylum-seekers, Pillay described situations where refugees wait in immigration centers for months or years. She recommended greater communication with both groups, a revamp of how the Aborigine Northern Territory is handled, and for political leaders to quit "demonizing" refugees and immigrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fred Abrahams, a special adviser at HRW, visited with Saif al-Islam in Zintan, Libya, where he is currently being detained and reported that while he has no complaints regarding the physical conditions at his place of detention, he is concerned at being unable to access a lawyer to help with his case. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/gaddafi-son-captured-by-libya-rebel-forces.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November on charges of committing crimes against humanity. While Abdelaziz al-Hasadi, Libya's general prosecutor, has assured HRW that Saif al-Islam will have the opportunity to meet with a lawyer, that assurance is conditioned upon the government first providing a secure detention center where he will be safe from attack. According to HRW, in spite of the validity of the security concerns, the new government should make every effort to provide him with access to a lawyer in order to preserve its goal of respecting detainee rights. In addition to denial of a lawyer, Saif al-Islam has also not been able to visit with any friends or family during his detention. 

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said that the ICC would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-says-libya-can-try-gaddafis-son.php">allow Libya to conduct the trial</a> [JURIST report] of Saif al-Islam. Despite concern from human rights groups, including HRW about whether he can <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/19/libya-surrender-saif-al-islam-gaddafi-icc">receive a fair trial</a> [HRW report] in Libya, Ocampo said he trusts the new Libyan government will be able to <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_LIBYA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT%22">try him fairly</a> [AP report] and maintained that the ICC will not intervene as long as it does not stray from ICC standards. The ICC issued a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/48F6B130-EC14-4A51-BC79-1CCF8633E270.htm">statement</a> [text]  clarifying that, "[s]hould the Libyan authorities wish to conduct national prosecutions against the suspect, they shall submit a challenge to the admissibility of the case before Pre-Trial Chamber I. ... Any decision on the admissibility of a case is under the sole competence of the Judges of the ICC." Ocampo's statement regarding the location of the trial came after his <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-arrives-in-libya-to-discuss-trial-of-gaddafis-son-intelligence-chief.php">visit to Libya</a> [JURIST report], during which he discussed the country's plans for the trial. Earlier in the month, Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim al-Keib <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/libya-prime-minister-assures-fair-trial-for-Gaddafi-son.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] that Saif al-Islam would receive a fair trial there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Forcing Belarus to respect peaceful protesters is one of the <a href = "http://chrissmith.house.gov/UploadedFiles/201_12_19_Speech_on_Belarus_Democracy_and_Human_Rights_Act.pdf">primary goals</a> [floor remarks text, PDF] of the new US sanctions:<blockquote>HR 515 states a US Government  policy of strong support for the Belarusan people in their struggle against Lukashenko to live in a free, independent country where their human rights are respected. The bill encourages those struggling despite overwhelming pressures from an antidemocratic regime. It calls for a full accounting of the 1999 to 2000 disappearances. ... It calls for a release of all of the political prisoners. We can't say that enough. We can't say it one day and forget it the next. We need to redouble our efforts, beginning today, to promote a free Belarus where all can live in peace, freedom and prosperity without that knock in the middle of the night by the KGB.</blockquote>On Thursday, three Ukrainian activists from the group <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/Femen.UA?sk=wall">Femen</a> [official Facebook profile] were <a href = "http://www.rferl.org/content/femen_activists_detained_by_belarus_kgb/24428304.html">released</a> [RFE/RL report] from Belarus custody after protesting Lukashenko's regime. The women <a href = "http://www.rferl.org/media/video/24429634.html">allege that they were kidnapped by Belarus KGB</a> [RFE/RL report], stripped and beaten. US Sanctions will not be lifted until there is an unconditional release of all political prisoners and new elections are held. The bill is expected to be signed by US <a href = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], who last <a href = "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/06/14/Obama-extends-Belarus-sanctions/UPI-78311308093457/">sanctioned Belarus in June</a> [UPI report].

<p>Belarus has been under increasing criticism for what many see as a rapid decline of human rights in the Eastern European nation. Last month, a Belarus court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/belarus-court-jails-human-rights-activist-for-tax-evasion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the president of <a href = "http://spring96.org/en">Viasana</a> and vice-president of the <a href = "http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation for Human Rights</a> (FIDH) [advocacy websites], of tax evasion, sentencing him to a four-and-a-half-year prison term amid international criticism. In September, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] suggested a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention in Belarus</a> [JURIST report] and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Her report also cited Belarus as the only European nation to still enforce the death penalty. Ambassador Mikhail Khvostov said his country disagrees with the UN on what constitutes a peaceful demonstration and that Belarus is committed to human rights. The month before, members of the Belarus Parliament introduced a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/belarus-lawmakers-move-to-ban-silent-protests.php">ban so-called "silent protests"</a> [JURIST report], including those involving large groups of people basically doing nothing. Nonetheless, <a href = "http://rt.com/news/belarus-silent-protest-opposition-971/">silent protests continue</a> [RT report], largely in defiance of Lukashenko. Earlier this year, Belarus' Minsk City Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-delivers-suspended-sentences-to-2-presidential-candidates-for-inciting-riots.php">delivered suspended sentences</a> for two former presidential candidates, Uladzimer Nyaklyaeu and Vital Rymasheuski, convicted of organizing <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">protests following the re-election</a> [JURIST reports] of Lukashenko. The two-year suspended sentences were handed down days after former presidential candidate <a href = "http://www.freebelarusnow.org/en/component/k2/item/43?ml=1">Andrey Sannikau</a> [Free Belarus Now profile] was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-inciting-riots.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/11/un-committee-concerned-about-belarus.php">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [JURIST reports] have similarly denounced Belarus for human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/documents/countrywidecomp.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], Countrywide engaged in a pattern of discriminatory conduct, charging minority borrowers higher fees and interest rates and steering them into sub-prime mortgages based not on their creditworthiness, but rather on their race or national origin. The proposed <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/documents/countrywidesettle.pdf">settlement</a> [text, PDF], filed in the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> and subject to court approval, will provide compensation to more than 200,000 minority borrowers. It will also require Countrywide to implement policies to prevent such discrimination in the future. The discrimination allegedly occurred between 2004 and 2008, before BOA acquired Countrywide in 2008. A BOA spokesperson pledged a commitment to "fair and equal treatment of all our customers."

<p>This is the latest in a series of legal problems for BOA. Earlier this month BOA <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-315-million-to-settle-investor-claims-of-deceipt.php">agreed to pay $315 million</a> [JURIST report] in a settlement of claims brought by investors alleging they were misled with respect to mortgage-backed investments. Last month a senior judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] gave <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-gives-final-approval-to-bank-of-america-overdraft-fee-settlement.php">final approval to a $410 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action suit against BOA for overdraft fees that affected more than 13 million people. The settlement with BOA, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/bank-of-america-settles-excessive-overdraft-fee-lawsuit.php">reached in February</a>, was given <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bank-of-america-gains-preliminary-approval-of-class-action-settlement-for-illegal-overdraft-fees.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST reports] in May. In June, BOA <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bank-of-america-to-pay-85-billion-to-settle-bad-mortgage-backed-securities-claims.php">agreed to pay $8.5 billion</a> [JURIST report] to settle claims that it sold bad securities contributing to the housing market collapse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit relates to the death of the US-born radical Muslim cleric <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed in a US drone strike</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen in September. The strike that killed al-Awlaki raised questions about the legality of the US ordering the targeted killing of American citizens. The lawsuit contends that the questions surrounding the legality of the US government's actions in al-Awlaki's death have led "legal scholars, human rights activists, and current and former government officials ... [to call] for the government to disclose its legal analysis justifying the use of targeted lethal force, especially as it applies to American Citizens." The NYT states that it filed FOIA requests in 2010 but the DOJ refused to release any memoranda or even confirm existence of any such documents related to the legal analysis justifying the killing. 

<p>Some information related to the death of al-Awlaki has already leaked to the media. In October an Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-legal-memo-justifies-killing-of-al-Awlaki.php">legal memorandum from last year</a> [JURIST report] found that the killing of US citizen and senior <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader al-Awlaki would only be legal if it were not feasible to take al-Awlaki alive. The secret document written by the DOJ <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Memo-made-legal-case-for-killing-2209696.php#ixzz1aIH3A85a">justified the decision</a> [NYT report] to kill al-Awlaki despite an executive order banning assassinations and a federal law against murder. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] criticized the targeted killing as a violation of both US and international law. The US has increased drone strikes in Yemen to try and reduce al Qaeda's power in the region and minimize the chaos spilling over the border into Saudi Arabia. The strike that killed al-Awlaki marks the US government's most successful attack against al Qaeda since the raid leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan last May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its ruling on December 20, the Kyrgyz Supreme Court upheld a verdict against eight ethnic Uzbeks who were found guilty of killing a policeman and injuring several other officers during <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/14/kyrgyzstan-conflict-background">mass disturbances in the city of Bazar-Kurgan in June 2010</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder]. The eight Uzbek nationals were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kyrgyzstan-court-issues-first-convictions-for-ethnic-violence.php">convicted in September 2010</a> [JURIST report] on charges including inciting ethnic hatred and complicity in murder. Seven of the defendants were sentenced to life and their sentences remain unchanged. The Kyrgyz Supreme Court reduced the 20-year sentence of the eighth defendant to 11 years. The defendants allege they were tortured while in custody and that their families were threatened. HRW criticized the ruling, arguing that the court should have sent the "case back for re-trial and instructed the prosecutorial authorities to investigate all allegations of torture, ill-treatment, and other violations of Kyrgyz and international law in this case."

<p>The Kyrgyz judicial system has been criticized by rights groups, including HRW, related to the treatment of detainees following the violence of June 2010. In June 2011 HRW and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] criticized [HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2011/06/08/distorted-justice">report</a>; AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19504">report</a>] Kyrgyzstan's lack of judicial progress, marking the one-year anniversary of the June 2010 ethnic violence that resulted in more than 300 deaths and 2,000 injuries. Both reports <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/99495">alleged</a> [HRW press release] that investigations have been conducted through torture and that typically, only confessions given through torture have been recognized as evidence while other, legitimate evidence has been ignored. Earlier this year, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">criticized Kyrgyzstan</a> [JURIST report] in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices </a>[materials], stating <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154482.htm">Kyrgyzstan</a> [materials] still faced significant rights issues and ethnic violence despite the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">overthrow of an authoritarian government</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">passage of a new constitution</a> [JURIST reports].

HRW made the statement after two Swedish journalists were <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-22/ethiopia-convicts-two-swedish-reporters-of-aiding-terrorism.html">convicted</a> [Bloomberg report] Wednesday of supporting terrorism under Ethiopia's <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009</a> [text]. The journalists, who face up to 15 years in prison, were on a "journalistic mission," according to Sweden's prime minister. HRW deputy Africa director Rona Peligal said, "[t]he vague and broad anti-terrorism law was open to abuse and it is being abused." HRW said the trial was unfair and called on Ethiopia to immediately release the journalists and drop all charges. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news/ethiopia-swedish-journalists-must-be-released-immediately-and-unconditionally-2011-12-21">called for their release</a> [press release].

In August, JURIST guest columnist and former executive director Abigail Salisbury argued that the government is using the law to suppress journalists and opposition groups in order to <a href="/forum/2011/08/abigail-salisbury-ethiopia-terror.php">maintain its hold on power</a> [JURIST op-ed].

Canadian <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/comment/minfin-eng.asp">Finance Minister Jim Flaherty</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/canada-finance-minister-proposes-national-securities-regulator.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/drleg-apl/csa-lvm-eng.htm">legislation</a> [text; official <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/n10/data/10-051_1-eng.asp">backgrounder</a>] in May 2010, and it was submitted to the Supreme Court for a ruling on its constitutionality. The court ruled unanimously that, "[t]he Securities Act as presently drafted is not valid under the general branch of the federal power to regulate trade and commerce under s. 91(2) of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/Const_index.html">Constitution Act, 1867</a> [text]." The court concluded:<blockquote>To summarize, we accept that the economic importance and pervasive character of the securities market may, in principle, support federal intervention that is qualitatively different from what the provinces can do. However, as important as the preservation of capital markets and the maintenance of Canada&#8217;s financial stability are, they do not justify a wholesale takeover of the regulation of the securities industry which is the ultimate consequence of the proposed federal legislation. The need to prevent and respond to systemic risk may support federal legislation pertaining to the national problem raised by this phenomenon, but it does not alter the basic nature of securities regulation which, as shown, remains primarily focused on local concerns of protecting investors and ensuring the fairness of the markets through regulation of participants. Viewing the Act as a whole, as we must, these local concerns remain the main thrust of the legislation&#8212;its pith and substance. </blockquote>Flaherty said the government would respect the court's decision and <a href="http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20111222/supreme-court-ruling-national-securities-regulator-111222/20111222/?hub=OttawaHome">proceed in accordance with it</a> [CTV report].

<p>The legislation was based on the recommendations of a seven-member panel appointed by Flaherty, which concluded in January 2010 that the <a href="http://www.ft.com/indepth/global-financial-crisis">global financial crisis</a> [FT backgrounder] increased the need for a national securities regulatory system. It came as a culmination of the efforts of successive Canadian governments to form a single securities regulator. When the legislation was proposed last year, Quebec <a href="http://www.premier.gouv.qc.ca/premier-ministre/biographie-en.asp">Premier Jean Charest</a> [official profile] sharply criticized it, saying that it would interfere with provincial jurisdiction and that his government would pursue a legal challenge in the <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/tribunaux/appel-a.htm">Quebec Court of Appeal</a> [officials website]. The governments of Alberta and Manitoba were also critical of the legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.camaraderepresentantes.org/">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in Spanish] passed the measure by a <a href="http://www.camaraderepresentantes.org/noticiasread4.asp?r={08EBF326-794F-4A5A-8713-8B3BC7BD730C}">vote of 31-13</a> [press release, in Spanish], and a plebiscite will be held on November 6, 2012, coinciding with next year's general elections and the island's gubernatorial election. Puerto Ricans will be asked to choose whether they want to change the island's status. If yes, they will be asked whether they prefer statehood, independence or a "sovereign commonwealth" free from the Territorial Clause of the US Constitution. Puerto Rican <a href="http://www.fortaleza.gobierno.pr/">Governor Luis Fortuno</a> (R) [official website, in Spanish], a supporter of statehood, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/puerto-rico-governor-submit-status-referendum-223217843.html">introduced the legislation</a> [AP report] in October, and it has now been approved by both the Puerto Rican House and the Senate. The legislation now awaits Fortuno's signature. Any change in Puerto Rico's status would still need to be approved by the US Congress and president.

<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-us-house-passes-bill-on-puerto-rico-status-referendum.php">approved a bill to establish the referendum</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010, but it was never approved by the Senate. In 2007, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/special_committee_main.htm">Special Committee on Decolonization</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/gacol3160.doc.htm">called on the US</a> [press release] to quickly resolve the island's political status and release political prisoners. Puerto Ricans last voted on the status of the island in <a href="http://electionspuertorico.org/1998/summary.html">1998</a> [results], with the "None of the Above" option winning 50.3 percent, statehood garnering 46.5 percent of the vote and independence only 2.5 percent. Referendums were also held in <a href="http://electionspuertorico.org/1993/summary.html">1993</a> and <a href="http://electionspuertorico.org/archivo/1967.html">1967</a> [results], in which maintaining the current political status won over statehood, and independence placed at a distant third. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated US territory, and its current political status was adopted in 1952 after Congress approved the <a href="http://www.topuertorico.org/constitu.shtml">Puerto Rican Constitution</a> [text]. The constitution established the island as a US commonwealth, causing the UN General Assembly to remove the island's categorization as a "non-self governing territory." Puerto Ricans have been US citizens since 1917, and the island has been under US control since 1898. JURIST Managing Editor Dwyer Arce recently argued that, as US citizens, Puerto Ricans <a href="/dateline/2011/12/dwyer-arce-popular-vote.php">should be entitled to vote</a> [JURIST comment] in US presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure would ban genocide denial generally, but it has sparked a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/22/us-france-turkey-genocide-idUSTRE7BL1FB20111222">diplomatic row with Turkey</a> [Reuters report], which does not classify the killings as a genocide. Turkish <correction num=1>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</correction> has strongly criticized the legislation, canceling all economic, political and military meetings with France and recalling its ambassador. France passed a law in 2001 recognizing the killings as genocide. The National Assembly approved legislation criminalizing denial of the Armenian genocide in 2006, but that measure was rejected by the Senate. The Senate must still approve the new legislation, which it will begin debating next year.

<p>The Armenian genocide is also a contentious issue in US law and politics. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-rehear-armenia-genocide-lawsuit.php">revisit a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a California law declaring Armenian genocide in Turkey conflicts with US foreign policy. In August 2010 a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdul Rahim Abdul Razak Al Ginco, a Syrian national who prefers the surname Janko, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guantanamo-detainee-suing-us-government-over-torture-allegations-report.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010, claiming that US military officials repeatedly tortured him during his nearly seven-and-a-half years at Guantanamo. The suit named 26 current or former members of the military who were allegedly responsible for the tortuous acts, such as urinating on Janko, slapping him, threatening him with loss of fingernails, sleep deprivation, extreme cold and stress positions. Judge Richard Leon dismissed the suit Thursday, concluding:<blockquote>War, by its very nature, victimizes many of those caught in its wake. Innocent civilians are invariably killed, and sometimes even mistakenly imprisoned. Our legal system was never designed to provide a remedy in our Courts for these inevitable tragedies, especially in a conflict like this where terrorists cunningly morph into their surroundings. Indeed, the Congress has specifically barred the Judicial Branch from reviewing "any aspect of the detention ... treatment ... or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination." For this Court to circumvent such a clear directive from our Legislative Branch would be an utter disregard of the limitations of our judicial power.</blockquote>Janko was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-rules-guantanamo-detainee.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from Guantanamo in June 2009 when Leon found that he could no longer be classified as an "enemy combatant" and that the government's argument against him defied common sense. Prior to being detained by the US military, Janko was imprisoned and tortured by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] for 18 months over suspicions that he was an American spy.

Pillay's statement follows a visit by a team of human rights officials to Bahrain last week at the invitation of the Bahrain government. Pillay expressed concern that members of her team observed that the people of Bahrain harbored a "deepening mistrust" of their government. She stated that the harsh crackdown on protesters combined with the continued impunity of officials suspected in the abuse and death of protesters has contributed greatly to the environment of mistrust. She called on the government to work to improve human rights conditions in order to rebuild national trust:<blockquote>The Bahraini authorities need to urgently take confidence-building measures including unconditionally releasing those who were convicted in military tribunals or are still awaiting trial for merely exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly. Thousands of individuals have lost their jobs for participating in demonstrations, many students have had their education derailed&#8212;these serious violations of their economic and social rights must be immediately addressed. Those who have been unfairly dismissed should be reinstated to their original functions. ... My team has come back with the message that there is a profound lack of trust in the Government, and this mistrust has deepened as a result of the violent crackdown on protestors, destruction of mosques, the lack of fair trials and the lack of progress in providing redress for violations.</blockquote>
Pillay said it was important that the government take positive measures to regain the nation's trust, including consulting with the public. She urged that any protesters in the country remain nonviolent. 

<p>Last Month <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission</a> [JURIST report] to look into government recommendations made in a report by an independent Bahraini government commission. The report stated that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">Bahrain authorities used excessive force</a> [JURIST report] and tortured detainees involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year. Also last month the Bahrain government <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-admits-use-of-excessive-force-against-pro-democracy-protesters.php">admitted the use of excessive force</a> [JURIST report] in anticipation of the independent report. This was a reversal of the government's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/world/meast/bahrain-unrest/index.html?eref=rss_world">previous defense of its actions</a> [CNN report]. In June Khalifa announced that an independent commission would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. In April, human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain for rampant human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] related to anti-government protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation requires police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest if they believe the person may be in the country illegally and requires businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system. It was challenged by a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-challenge-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">coalition of civil rights groups</a> and the US <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [JURIST reports], which both argued that it is unconstitutional, invites racial profiling and interferes with federal law. Judge Richard Gergel blocked the provision that requires police to check immigration status, finding, "[t]his state-mandated scrutiny is without consideration of federal enforcement priorities and unquestionably vastly expands the persons targeted for immigration enforcement action. He also blocked the provision that outlaws harboring or transporting an illegal immigrant, finding a likelihood of irreparable harm. The law was set to take effect January 1. 

<p>Similar immigration laws are being challenged throughout the US. Last week Alabama and Georgia filed motions in the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/states-seek-to-delay-immigration-cases-pending-supreme-court-ruling.php">seeking to stay proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on challenges to their immigration laws pending a ruling by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-182.htm">Arizona v. United States</a> [docket]. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to rule on a challenge to Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials], which criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. A challenge is also pending to an immigration law in <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a>,  and an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana law has been blocked</a> [JURIST reports] by a federal judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko is under <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/indefinite-detention-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-draws-criticism.php">indefinite detention</a> after being <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/ukraine-appeals-court-denies-release-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">denied release</a> [JURIST reports] last week. In her statement, Tymoshenko lambasted the Ukrainian judiciary, and stated that nothing will change while current Ukrainian president and long-time political rival <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] is in charge.<blockquote>This is not 1937. This is their second year in power, and they have pushed our country beyond the boundaries of our era, an era of basic humanity and decency. This is the age of cave dwellers in its worst forms. In this situation, I see no reason or necessity to continue to support the farce in the Ukrainian courts. I will not seek the truth in them, because it's not there. Let them play their games of crooked justice, if they want, demonstrating to the world their immorality and insidiousness. I believe the European Court of Human Rights will assess the absurdity and crime that the Ukrainian government calls court. At the same time I would like to note that despite all the torture and humiliation, they haven&#8217;t broken me and never will. I continue my fight, because even here behind bars, I feel freer than all the Yanukovychs behind the government fences.</blockquote>Yanukovych said on Thursday that he is <a href = "http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/89597/">not opposed to Tymoshenko's release</a> [<em>Interfax</em> report] under certain conditions. This is likely in reaction to the ECHR <a href = "http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&documentId=897323&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">"fast tracking"</a> [press release, PDF] Tymoshenko's case, which it announced earlier this week.

<p>Tymoshenko's prosecution has been <a href="/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodosky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">highly controversial</a> [JURIST comment] and has drawn harsh criticism internationally. Last week, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118626/">expressed its concern</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report] regarding a lack of transparency of Ukrainian hearings in prison, and declared that such a process does not correspond to the jurisprudence of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. In November, the Ukrainian Parliament <a href="http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=290035&cat_id=105995">voted against</a> [agenda text] hearing amendments that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ukraine-parliament-rejects-hearing-bill-designed-to-free-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">may have freed</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko by fining her rather than sentencing her for her criminal convictions. The EU has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/european-parliament-condemns-jailing-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the former prime minister's conviction as politically-motivated, and has indicated that the prosecution could harm Ukraine's bid for EU accession. Tymoshenko herself has also made efforts to demonstrate that the charges are motivated by her adversaries, but to no avail. In August, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused an appeal</a> of her detention for contempt charges for a lack of legal grounds to contest the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">arrest</a> [JURIST reports]. Also, in June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging various violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and arguing that her charges were politically engineered by Yanukovych. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the presidential election in March 2010, but Tymoshenko has claimed that widespread voter fraud contributed to the outcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint called for individual compensation for property damage and for the government to establish a victims' fund. In total, the flooding killed approximately 600 people and affected about 2.4 million others in the country.

<p>The Thai government has also faced international criticism for its strict laws and its human rights record.

The UN has <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-condemns-thailand-royal-insult-law.php">condemned </a> [JURIST report] the law, saying that the law prohibits freedom of speech. In August, the UN urged the Thai government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">improve measures to combat human trafficking</a> [JURIST report], as well as protect the rights of migrant workers.

The decision came after a <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2011/12_-_December/Allen_Stanford_competent_for_trial_-_judge/">three-day hearing</a> [Reuters report] in which U.S. District Judge David Hittner decided that Stanford was able to assist his lawyers in preparing for trial. Stanford has been in federal custody since his arrest in June 2009. His lawyers were unsuccessful in arguing that he suffered from <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-22/allen-stanford-found-mentally-fit-to-stand-trial-for-alleged-ponzi-scheme.html">retrograde amnesia and diminished mental capacity </a> [Bloomberg report] as a result of head injuries sustained during a 2009 assault while in prison. Doctors and psychologists at the prison hospital have accused Stanford of faking symptoms of amnesia. The trial is scheduled to begin on January 23.

<p>In February, Stanford filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/financier-stanford-sues-federal-agents-over-civil-rights-violations.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing federal agents of violating his constitutional rights. The suit, filed in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a>, named 12 defendants, including members of the FBI, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites]. Stanford alleged that the defendants used "abusive law-enforcement methods" to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">pursue a frivolous civil suit</a> [JURIST report] against him in order to gather evidence for his criminal prosecution. In January, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-orders-stanford-trial-delayed.php">indefinitely postponed</a> [JURIST report] Stanford's trial, citing a chemical dependency that prevented Stanford from standing trial. In June 2009, Stanford pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 21 charges of fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chen, 42, was sentenced after a two hour hearing in which he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/23/us-china-dissident-idUSTRE7BM0C120111223">pleaded not guilty to inciting subversion</a> [Reuters report] of state power. He was charged for having written essays critical of the Communist Party, which Chen published on overseas Chinese websites, avoiding the national Internet censorship firewalls. He was one of more than 130 activists detained after the US-based news site <a href="http://boxun.com/">Boxun</a> [website, in Chinese] reported an anonymous appeal for people to stage protests across China last February. The vast majority of those detained have been released without charges or on bail, but officials apparently wanted to make an example of Chen, and China's party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants in trials for political charges. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called the sentence unacceptable and urged Chinese authorities to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/china-amnesty-international-condemns-harsh-sentence-activist-chen-wei-2011-12-23">release Chen immediately</a> [press release]. His sentence is the third-longest term ever handed down for inciting subversion in China.

<p>The two longer sentences for subversion convictions belong to Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], who has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] since 2009, and Liu Xianbin, who was jailed for 10 years in March. In May the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Liu Xiaobo, who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-awarded-nobel-peace-prize-in-absentia.php">awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] after being jailed for a subversion conviction in a trial that lasted only two hours and was closed to foreign diplomats. Earlier this week prominent civil rights lawyer <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zhisheng">news archive</a>] was sent to prison for three years for violating his probation, the first <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-again-jails-prominent-rights-lawyer-after-20-month-disappearance.php">sign that he is still alive</a> [JURIST report] since having disappeared 20 months ago, presumably at the hands of the authorities. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] in June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to release protesters arrested for their Tiananmen Square involvement and account for those missing or killed during the suppression. The State Department also urged China to protect universal human rights afforded to peaceful dissenters, and to release those that had been detained or placed under house arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

heard closing arguments Thursday at the pre-trial hearing for <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/">Pfc. Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bradley+manning">news archive</a>], which will determine whether he will face a court martial for his alleged role in the largest intelligence leak in US history. Manning, who served as an Army intelligence analyst in Iraq, faces <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/23/justice/manning-hearing/index.html">22 criminal charges and possible life imprisonment</a> [CNN report] for leaking a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzYTxuW2vmzk">controversial classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq and nearly 750,000 classified US military and <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] documents, much of which landed on <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">Wikileaks</a> [website] last year. The Article 32 hearing, the military justice system's rough equivalent of a grand jury hearing, is conducted publicly and the defense is allowed to cross-examine witnesses and present their own witnesses and evidence. At the hearing, Manning's lawyers <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/22/us-usa-defense-manning-idUSTRE7BL1G620111222">accused prosecutors of overreaching</a> [Reuters report], saying the massive release of documents caused no harm to national security, and asking the court to throw out charges of aiding and giving intelligence to the enemy. They also urged the court to dismiss several other counts, saying overall security within Manning's unit was lax. Aiding the enemy is a capital offense that could bring the death penalty, but the prosecution has said it intends to seek life in prison for the soldier. Manning's attorney focused his closing remarks on urging the prosecution to seek a prison term of no more than 30 years. Manning will not know for several weeks whether he will face a court martial.

<p>A <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] panel of experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">declared Manning competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in April. Manning's prosecution has sparked heated debate between defenders and critics. Those who support Manning's actions refer to him as <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/manning1/petition.html">courageous for acting as a whistleblower</a> [advocacy petition] against government crime and corruption. He has been compared to famous US whistleblowers such as <a href="http://www.frankserpico.com/">Frank Serpico</a> and <a href="http://www.ellsberg.net/">Daniel Ellsberg</a> [personal websites], who leaked information regarding corruption in the New York Police Department and the Pentagon, respectively. Former Secretary of Defense <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Robert_Gates">Robert Gates </a>[WP profile] has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895204575321080522272718.html">criticized the video</a> [WSJ report], claiming it provides the public a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw." He noted that public attention was not drawn to what was discovered by US ground forces following the helicopter gunfire, including AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. He also said that terrorist organizations are made up of combatants who do not wear enemy uniforms. In August, lawyer <a href="http://charleslugosi.com/index.html">Charles Lugosi</a> [profile] wrote that Patriot Act provisions and criminal sanctions placed on whistleblowers like Manning <a href="/sidebar/2011/08/charles-lugosi-rule-of-law.php">violate the Constitution</a> [JURIST commentary] and fundamentally challenge the legitimacy of the rule of law and American democracy. Lugosi noted that individuals, through websites and social networking, can expose modern injustice and raise the conscious awareness of the public to worthy causes and crusades. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Snyder provided a <a href="http://www.pridesource.com/btl-db/images/1951/SigningStatement.pdf">signing statement</a> [text, PDF] noting that a new definition of public employer in the bill excludes university employees. He said this is necessary based on various Michigan Supreme Court cases and the several sections of the Michigan Constitution, including Article VIII, <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Article-VIII-5">Section 5</a> [text, html], <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Article-VIII-6">Section 6</a> [text, html] and <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Article-XI-5">Article XI, Section 5</a> [text, html], that give institutions of higher education authority over the control and direction of all expenditures of the institutions' funds. HB 4770 passed in the state Senate earlier this month passed the House in September. The <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">Michigan American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] (ACLU) criticized the bill with Kary L. Moss, ACLU of Michigan executive director, <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/issues/lgbt-rights/2011-12/1648">saying</a> [press release] that its approval during the holiday season is merely "mean-spirited and cruel." Moss said the organization will prepare to challenge the law during the next few weeks.

<p>Many states, like Michigan, are facing issues pertaining to benefits for same-sex partners. Last month, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ACLU-appeals-dismissal-of-same-sex-couples-benefits-to-Montana-high-court.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] against a similar bill in Montana where the State approved a law that denied partnership benefits to same-sex couples. They argued that the new law violates of the Montana Constitution. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-arizona-same-sex-couples-insurance-benefits-temporarily.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in September that a <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/legtext/44leg/2r/bills/hb2013s.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] rescinding health benefits for same-sex couples in the public sector is against the equal protection clause of the Arizona Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] (DOJ) Friday <a href="http://media.charleston.net/2011/pdf/dojscvoteridletter_12232011.pdf">rejected</a> [decision text, PDF] a controversial <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/3003.htm">South Carolina voter identification law</a> [R54 materials]. The DOJ has authority under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to screen new voter laws in states with a history of discriminatory voter practices. The South Carolina law, enacted to prevent voter fraud, would have required residents to present a current government-issued ID to cast a ballot. However, Assistant US Attorney General Thomas Perez said the voter-ID requirement resulted in significant racial disparities and that South Carolina had not met its burden to show that these disparities would not have a discriminatory effect on minority voters.<blockquote>In sum, however analyzed, the state's data demonstrate that non-white voters are both significantly burdened by section 5 of Act R54 in absolute terms, and also disproportionately unlikely to possess the most common types of photo identification among the forms of identification that would be necessary for in-person voting under the proposed law ... Until South Carolina succeeds in substantially addressing the racial disparities described above, however, the state cannot meet its burden of proving that, when compared to the benchmark standard, the voter identification requirements proposed in section 5 of Act R54 will not have a retrogressive effect.</blockquote> South Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.sc.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Nikki Haley</a> [official website] and the state <a href="http://www.scag.gov/">Attorney General Alan Wilson</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2011/12/23/4143387/justice-department-blocks-south.html#storylink=cpy">said</a> [McClatchy report] that they are going to appeal the DOJ ruling of the DOJ. Wilson pointed to the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-allows-indiana-voter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a similar law in Indiana.

<p>In August, the South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-democrats-protest-against-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the DOJ asking for rejection of the new voter ID law. They argued that the new law is too restrictive because it required voters to have both a valid and current identification which would have the result of excluding persons whose licenses are revoked or suspended. This objection followed a previous attempt by several South Carolina civil rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.lwvsc.org/">League of Women Voters of South Carolina</a> [advocacy website] who <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] in their <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/comment_under_section_5_re_submission_no__2011-2495.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the DOJ that the new voter ID law would have discriminatory effect. There are now 30 US states that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In Wisconsin, several civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] this month challenging the new <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23">voter identification law</a> [2011 Wisconsin Act 23]. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. In March, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October last year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ashton voiced concern over Tymoshenko's prior trial, alleging that the appeals process did not address the failures of the original trial to provide a fair and independent process by international standards. Ashton further voiced regret that Tymoshenko will be prevented from participating in the parliamentary elections next year. She said that the EU stresses the need for an impartial and transparent appeals process. The EU <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/119594/#ixzz1hSyAGna7">delayed signing an agreement</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report]  with the Ukraine on political association and free trade in order to address this issue.

The announcement was motivated by <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2103070,00.html#ixzz1hSzGJkVg">humanitarian concerns</a> [AP report], in an effort by President Raul Castro to establish good will in anticipation of a visit by Pope Benedict XVI to Cuba scheduled for next spring. Alan Gross, a US citizen who is serving a <a href="http://">15-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for installing internet equipment as part of a US program, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/24/us-cuba-prisoners-idUSTRE7BN00A20111224">will not be pardoned</a> [Reuters report] along with the thousands of other prisoners. The ruling Council of State took into account appeals for amnesty from both Roman Catholic Church officials in Cuba and family members of the prisoners. However, the head of the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights criticized the amnesty as merely meant to protect Cuba's image rather than a signal of real reform. Cuba has had a history of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2011/cuba">allegedly rooting out political dissent</a> [HRW backgrounder] through criminal prosecutions.

<p>In March, a court in Cuba sentenced Gross to 15 years in prison for attempting to undermine the communist government of Cuba. US National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor immediately denounced the ruling, calling the 15-year sentence an "injustice." Before this incident, the historically strained relations between the US and Cuba had shown signs of improvement. Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Departments of <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State</a>, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury</a>, and <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Homeland Security</a> [official websites] to take steps to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Approximately <a href = "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/2011122353147515588.html">44 people</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] were killed Friday in two suicide car bomb attacks in Damascus. The <a href = "http://www.sana.sy/index_eng.html">Syrian Arab News Agency</a> (SANA) [official website] has since linked the attacks to anti-government protests, while protesters and their supporters have suggested that the state planted attacks to coincide with an <a href = "http://www.arableagueonline.org">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic] visit. Ban's press release pleaded that both groups resist violence: "The Secretary-General is gravely concerned at the escalating violence in Syria. Today's explosions in Damascus, which resulted in more deaths and injuries, underscore his growing concerns.  He emphasizes that all violence is unacceptable and must stop immediately." The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] echoed the Ban's sentiments the same day, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40833&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">declaring</a> [UN News Centre report] that the recent car bombings were acts of terrorism. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reports that over 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began in March.

<p>The growing violence in Syria has drawn copious international attention recently. In his annual Christmas message on Sunday, the Pope <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16328895">called for an end to bloodshed in Syria</a> [BBC report]. Last week, the UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10498.doc.htm">extended</a> [resolution] the term of its observer force monitoring a ceasefire between Syria and Israel until the end of June 2012. Two weeks ago, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hrw-says-syria-officials-ordered-civilian-attacks-calls-for-icc-investigation.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Syrian army commanders of ordering troops to attack unarmed protesters in an effort to quash public demonstrations entirely. Both HRW and the UN OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-again-urges-security-council-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttobacco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A group of Attorneys General representing 24 US states and territories filed an <em>amicus</em> brief with the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday arguing that the <a href = "http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] can require cigarette packages to display graphic images of the dangers of smoking. The AGs believe that the government's duty to inform the public of the risks that tobacco poses should trump tobacco companies' free speech rights, saying that the government could require graphic labels for lethal and addictive products. The brief also claimed that current warnings on cigarette packages were inadequate in curbing tobacco use and more explicit labels, which include <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9RR0GFO1.htm">depictions</a> [AP report] of a sewn-up corpse of a smoker and a picture of diseased lungs, would better protect the public. The brief is in support of the FDA <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/fda-to-appeal-order-blocking-new-tobacco-warning-label-requirements.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a district court decision banning the labels. In November, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-tobacco-label-requirements.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report</a>] the implementation of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/CigaretteWarningLabels/default.htm">new requirements</a> [FDA backgrounder], which mandated that all cigarettes would have graphic warnings detailing the dangers of tobacco use. The brief was filed by Attorneys General from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, the Virgin Islands, Washington and West Virginia. No date has been set for the appeal trial.

<p>Tobacco warning labels have garnered a great deal of controversy recently, both in the US and abroad. Three weeks ago, JURIST guest columnist Allyn Taylor <a href="/forum/2011/12/allyn-taylor-tobacco-suit.php">warned</a> [JURIST comment] that nations' recent efforts to regulate cigarette labeling could trigger a series of successful tobacco industry lawsuits. Earlier this month, two tobacco companies <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/second-tobacco-company-challenges-new-australia-packaging-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] Australia's <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011B00128">Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill</a> [text], which requires depictions on cigarette boxes of the negative effects of smoking. In late November, <a href="http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_hk.aspx">Philip Morris Asia Ltd.</a> [corporate website] filed suit on behalf of its Australian affiliate [JURIST report], seeking compensation for its loss of Australian investments. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] signed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">report</a>] into law, granting the FDA certain authority to regulate manufactured tobacco products. The legislation heightened warning-label requirements, prohibited marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allowed for the regulation of cigarette ingredients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bin Laden</a> [materials]. A <a href = "http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of New York</a> [official website] judge granted the plaintiffs' motion for judgment against Iran, its Supreme Leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3018932.stm">Ayatollah Ali Hoseini-Kharmenei</a>, former Iranian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4104532.stm">Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani</a> [BBC profiles] and several other sovereign defendants holding that they are liable under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C97.txt">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> (FSIA) [text] for knowingly aiding <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] through <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4314423.stm">Hezbollah</a> [BBC profile] in the 9/11 attack. The findings of facts concluded that Iran "provid[ed] safe haven to al Qaeda leaders and operatives, keeping them safe from retaliation by US forces" and "facilitat[ed] the travel of eight to ten of the 9/11 hijackers to Iran or Beirut immediately after their acquisition of their US visas." Mehmanparast stated that the allegations were unfounded and without merit: "The United States has made repeated false claims about its illegitimate political goals to endanger international peace and security." 

<p>The affidavits that were the foundation of the recent judgment <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/iran-implicated-in-911-attacks-by-lawsuit.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in May by relatives of 9/11 victims. The initial suit, <span class = "casename">Havlish v. Bin Laden</span> was filed in 2002 after previous unsuccessful attempts to indict other nations in the 9/11 attacks through litigation. Two years ago, the US <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit initiated by survivors of the 9/11 attacks against Saudi Arabia and its four princes holding that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the princes intended the money they donated to be used for al Qaeda attacks. In addition, the court held that they were protected from prosecution under the FSIA. A similar ruling took place in 2005, when the US District Judge Richard Casey <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in a 9/11 litigation due to their immunity from prosecution under the same act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to <a href="http://www.parliament.bg/en/MP/980">Svetlana Angelova</a> [official profile] this ratification will result in several legislation amendments that will ensure that Bulgarian citizens with disabilities are treated as equal citizens and minimize discrimination against them in the area of education, healthcare and environment. Bulgaria was one of the few states that has failed to ratify the UN document and has been criticized for its treatment of disabled people, especially those with mental disabilities. The nation has a pending case in the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Courts of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], <a href = "http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&documentId=881237&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Stanev v. Bulgaria</a> [press release, PDF], contesting the living conditions of state-run facilities for disabled people, as well as a lack of rights for challenging diagnoses and placement. The plaintiff, Roussi Stanev, was interred in a social care home after members of his family requested he be put under state care. Stanev argued before the ECHR that, under current Bulgarian law, it was impossible for him to have his legal capacity restored or rexamined. Angelova guaranteed that after signing the treaty, all laws in Bulgaria will be amended to come into compliance, including the penal code.

<p>The United States <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Valerie-Jarrett-and-Ambassador-Rice-on-the-UN-Convention-on-the-Rights-of-Persons/">signed</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/us-signs-un-disability-rights-treaty.php">report</a>] the treaty in July of 2009 after US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/us-to-sign-un-disability-rights-treaty.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] during a celebration commemorating the 19th anniversary of the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> [DOJ materials] that the US would sign the convention. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/un-disability-rights-treaty-enters-into.php">entered into force</a> [JURIST report] in May of 2008 for the purpose of protecting the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/facts.shtml">650 million persons living with disabilities worldwide</a> [UN fact sheet] from being discriminated due to their disabilities. The treaty has been signed by 142 members and ratified by 62 after it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-disability-rights-treaty-opening-for.php">opened for signature</a> [JURIST report] in March of 2007. The convention was <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-general-assembly-approves-landmark.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] by the UN General Assembly in December of 2006 and was hailed as the "first human rights treaty to be adopted in the twenty-first century; the most rapidly negotiated human rights treaty in the history of international law; and the first to emerge from lobbying conducted extensively through the Internet" by then, Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] clarified its stance on online gambling in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/2011/state-lotteries-opinion.pdf">memorandum opinion</a> [text, PDF] released Friday holding online non-sports related gambling that crosses state or international borders is not covered by the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C50.txt">Wire Act of 1961</a> [text]. The opinion  dealt with the online, out-of-state sale of lottery tickets in Illinois and New York, but could open the door for online gambling as a whole. Specifically, the opinion suggests that the Wire Act was only meant to regulate sporting events instead of all online gambling. The opinion centers around the interpretation of one section of the Wire Act which states: "Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both." The DOJ limited its interpretation of the law: <blockquote>Given that the Wire Act does not reach interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a 'sporting event or contest' and that the state-run lotteries proposed by New York and Illinois do not involve sporting events or contests, we conclude that the Wire Act does not prohibit the lotteries described in these proposals.</blockquote> The opinion shifts the administration's stance in a way that could allow non-sports related interstate online gambling under federal law. The DOJ's opinion ends by saying its stance needs to be reconciled with existing federal legislation.

<p>The Wire Act is not the only law affecting online gambling. In November, New Jersey passed <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/new-jersey-voters-allow-state-wide-sports-gambling.php">Public Question 1</a> [JURIST report] by a 65 percent margin, amending the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp">New Jersey constitution</a> [text] to legalize sports gambling. The <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/SupremeCourt/">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled last year that a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/washington-high-court-upholds-states-internet-gambling-ban.php">state ban on online gambling</a> [JURIST report] is constitutional. That month, the<a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm"> EU Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] delivered three judgments <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/eu-court-strikes-down-germany-gambling-restrictions.php">striking down gambling restrictions</a> [JURIST report] in Germany because the regulations were not designed to protect public interest. The ECJ upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/eu-court-reaffirms-nation-bans-on-online-gambling.php">Swedish law restricting Internet gambling </a>[JURIST report]. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411:">Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006</a> (UIGEA) [HR 4411 summary] bans banks and financial institutions from intentionally accepting payments from credit cards, checks, or electronic fund transfers related to unlawful Internet bets. This act was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/bush-signs-tough-internet-gambling.php">passed by George W. Bush in 2006</a>, but <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-delays-enforcement-of.php">enforcement of the bill was delayed</a> [JURIST reports] by the Obama Administration in 2009. <br />

The charges against Chen, 57, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/26/china-jails-dissident-chen-xi?newsfeed=true">stemmed from more than 30 political essays</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that he had published online. He was detained late last month after he helped to campaign for independent candidates running in the upcoming elections. Chen has been politically active for decades and has been jailed numerous times as a result. In 1989, he was jailed for supporting student protests, and in 1995, he received another prison sentence of 10 years. The judge who ruled on Chen's case after a short trial cited Chen's repeated offenses as one reason behind the most recent lengthy jail sentence. Chen maintains his innocence but has no plans to appeal the ruling. His sentence is one of the longest terms ever handed down for inciting subversion in China. Two longer sentences for subversion convictions belong to Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], who has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] since 2009, and Liu Xianbin, who was jailed for 10 years in March.

<p>Chen is the second dissident in four days to be sentenced in the ongoing government crackdown on dissidents, rights activists and protest organizers. Last week, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-sentences-dissident-to-nine-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] human rights advocate Chen Wei, who is unrelated to Chen Xi, to nine years in prison. Chen Wei, 42, was sentenced after a two-hour hearing in which he pleaded not guilty to inciting subversion of state power. He was charged for having written essays critical of the Communist Party, which he published on overseas Chinese websites, avoiding the national Internet censorship firewalls. Chen was one of more than 130 activists detained after the US-based news site <a href="http://boxun.com/">Boxun</a> [website, in Chinese] reported an anonymous appeal for people to stage protests across China last February. The vast majority of those detained have been released without charges or on bail, but officials apparently wanted to make an example of Chen, and China's party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants in trials for political charges. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called the sentence unacceptable and urged Chinese authorities to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/china-amnesty-international-condemns-harsh-sentence-activist-chen-wei-2011-12-23">release Chen immediately</a> [press release]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The company chartered a ship, the Probo Koala, to deliver and unload acidic and corrosive fuel refining waste in the Netherlands, but had it pumped back onto the ship due to processing costs. The court acquitted Trafigura of one count of forgery related to the events in 2006, but refused to overturn the company's convictions for <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204552304577116433990404266.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">illegally exporting waste</a> [WSJ report]. The court also rejected an appeal by Dutch prosecutors to increase the amount of the fine. It was alleged that the waste caused 15 deaths and thousands of individuals to become ill near the Ivory Coast. Human rights group <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news/trafigura-guilty-verdict-upheld-toxic-waste-dumping-case-2011-12-23">praised</a> [press release] the court's decision, calling it "an important step towards justice" for those affected. 

<p>Trafigura was appealing the July 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/dutch-court-fines-oil-trading-company-for-dumping-hazardous-waste-in-africa.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of the Amsterdam District Court, which originally handed down the fine after finding the company guilty of the charges against it. Lawyers for the company believed Judge Frans Bauduin <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/23/amsterdam-court-fines-oil-trader-trafigura-million-role-hazardous-waste-case/">applied the incorrect treaty</a> [AP report] in finding that exporting the waste to Ivory Coast was illegal, arguing that the <a href="http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=678&topic_id=258">Marine Pollution Treaty</a> [MARPOL 73/78 text] applied, under which such exportation was legal. Trafigura paid 152 million euros (USD $196.4 million) to Ivory Coast in 2007 to assist with clean-up efforts and settled a civil suit filed in the UK in 2009 by agreeing to compensate 30,000 Abidjan residents made ill by the waste a total of $1,500 each. The Amsterdam court also found the captain of the Probo Koala guilty of co-delivering the hazardous waste and forgery related to concealing its nature. He was sentenced to a five-month suspended prison term. Trafigura employee Naeem Ahmed was also found guilty of leading the harmful delivery and was sentenced to a 6-month suspended sentence and a fine of 25,000 euros (USD $32,300). </p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Hashemi <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSEuW-cqHJ4">denies the charges</a> [Al Jazeera video] and has moved to the Kurdish region of northern Iraq to avoid appearing at trial, which he claims will be biased against him. Al-Hashemi's statement comes in response to a <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/iraq-politics-hashemi-idINDEE7BI0G020111219">warrant issued last week for his arrest</a> [Reuters report] by Shiite <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic]. Al-Maliki alleges that Al-Hashemi and his security forces carried out secret assassinations of political enemies. On Friday, protesters <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/23/184198.html">took to the streets in support of Hashemi</a> [Al Arabiya report], many alleging that the charges against him are politically motivated. The sectarian violence was ignited just days after the last US troops left Iraq, and threatens to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. 

<p>On Sunday US <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fadministration%2Fvice-president-biden&ei=L_H4ToXkPKjd0QGA7smZAg&usg=AFQjCNFwjH3wjycsLkKGGyFMAzl3eCyP0g&sig2=SVX3WcXEqbWeYjzbRfpOeA">Vice President Joe Biden</a> [official website] <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BIDEN_IRAQ?SITE=NCJAC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">spoke with Maliki</a> [AP report], expressing his condolences for last week's violence and discussing the political climate. The US ended it's 9-year <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">Iraq War</a> [JURIST feature] earlier this month when the government officially declared the war at an end and withdrew its remaining troops from the country. The US also <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-transfers-final-detainee-to-iraq-government.php">handed over the last detainee</a> [JURIST report] in Iraq, Ali Mussa Daqduq, to Iraqi authorities as part of the end of the war. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/hezbollah-leader-could-get-us-military-trial.php">considered trying Daqduq on US soil</a> [JURIST report], but was unable to come to an agreement with Iraqi officials and so transferred Daqduq to Iraq officials.

ONLF <a href="http://onlf.org/?p=275">condemned the sentencing</a> [ONLF press release] as a "heinous" and "unjust" act conducted to "frighten and terrorize the international correspondents for investigating the blatant violation of the Human Rights of the people of Ogaden."  The journalists faced a maximum sentence of 18 years in prison under Ethiopia's <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009</a> [text]. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the journalists' trial as unfair and called on Ethiopia to immediately release the journalists and drop all charges. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] also called for their <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/ethiopia-swedish-journalists-must-be-released-immediately-and-unconditionally-2011-12-21">release</a> [press release]. The journalists are faced with the difficult decision of whether or not to appeal or to ask for a pardon that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/27/world/africa/ethiopia-swedish-journalists/index.html">requires admitting guilt</a> [CNN report].  

<p>Ethiopia's anti-terrorism law has faced ongoing criticism since it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ethiopia-lawmakers-pass-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. HRW has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/21/ethiopia-journalists-convicted-under-unfair-law">said</a> [press release] that Ethiopia's anti-terrorism law is "fundamentally flawed and being used to repress legitimate reporting."

Samira Ibrahim brought the case against the Egyptian Army after she was arrested during a protest and was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/20111227132624606116.html">forced to submit to a virginity test</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report]. Judge Aly Fekry, head of the Court, delivered the order to stop the procedure of virginity tests on woman inside military prisons. However, the head of military intelligence, Adel Mursi, said that the ruling is essentially meaningless because there are no orders in the military to conduct such tests. Yet, there are reports to the contrary that Egyptian Army Generals have acknowledged the practice and have presented it as a means to avoid rape allegations from the women who are being detained. The forced virginity tests have been condemned by human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egyptian-women-protesters-forced-take-&#8216;virginity-tests&#8217;-2011-03-23">called upon the Egyptian government</a> [AI report] to investigate the practice after other women protesters had come forward with allegations about forced virginity tests. 

<p>Forced virginity testing is not the only act that has been controversial in Egypt concerning protests. Egyptian authorities have also been accused of using excessive violence. In November, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-egypt-violence.php">condemned the violent clashes</a> [JURIST report] between Egyptian security forces and protesters and called for an independent investigation into the situation. Pillay "urge[d] the Egyptian authorities to end the clearly excessive use of force against protestors in Tahrir square and elsewhere in the country, including the apparent improper use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition." AI has also accused Egyptian officials of <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-report-egypt-military-rulers-abused-protesters-violated-human-rights.php">violating human rights</a>  [JURIST report] including abuse of protesters and journalists who voice their dissatisfaction with the government. All of these acts stem from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-protesters-decry-ruling-military-council-clash-with-police.php">protest</a> [JURIST report] that took place in November in which over 50,000 people gathered to decry the military's contented rule over the nation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was proposed in response to many corruption scandals that have occurred in India recently including a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/india-upper-house-of-parliament-impeaches-high-court-judge.php">high court judge embezzling funds</a> [JURIST report]. Also, Indian activist Anna Hazare's twelve day fast in August prompted the the Indian government to address the issue of corruption. But Hazare is now on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16336614">another hunger strike</a> [BBC report] against the Lokpal bill arguing it is not strict enough because it keeps one of the top Indian investigating agencies, the <a href="http://cbi.nic.in/">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> (CBI) [official website] out of the jurisdiction of the new proposed agency. The Indian government has been criticized for its weak response to ending the corruption and more than 130,000 Hazare supports have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/world/asia/indian-parliament-begins-debate-on-corruption-bill.html">volunteered to participate civil disobedience protests to force mass jailing</a> [NYT report] if the parliament does not pass a stricter Lokpal bill. Hazare and his supporters want the proposed agency to have its own investigative arm, apart from that of CBI, and a charter within the agency that provides for a quick investigation of complaints filed against the government. The current Lokpal bill will be voted on in parliament's upper house, <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsweb.asp">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website], for final approval on Wednesday.

<p>Corruption has been a major issue recently in Indian politics. Earlier this month, the Transparency Index (TI) released its Corruptions Perceptions Index in which <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/183-countries-ranked-in-annual-corruption-index.php">it named India</a> as one of the countries whose corruption perception had deteriorated since last year. In August, Indian president Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil addressed <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-president-government-to-address-corruption.php">both houses of parliament</a> [JURIST report] and stated that the Indian government would take measures to ratify the UN Convention Against Corruption and that it will take other legislative and administrative measures necessary to improve transparency. In 2008, Indian PM <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-pm-backs-special-courts-for.php">called for the establishment of special courts</a> [JURIST report] to deal only with corruption charges, telling a convention of high-ranking justices and government ministers that, "apart from pendency and delayed justice, corruption is another challenge we face both in government and the judiciary."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal judge rules BP not negligent in Alaska oil spill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontoilpollution.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.akd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Alaska</a> [official website] on Tuesday dismissed the petition of federal prosecutors, finding that <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP">news archive</a>] was not negligent in a 2009 oil spill. Because the spill, which released 13,500 gallons of oil onto the North Slope of Alaska, was not a result of BP's negligence, BP did not violate the terms of its probation. BP's <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/63603--us-judge-rejects-attempt-to-revoke-bp-s-probation-for-oil-spill-lifts-company-s-restrictions">probation began as a result of a 2007 conviction</a> [AP report] when the company was found negligent for spilling 200,000 gallons of oil on the North Slope in 2006. Prosecutors linked the two spills as evidence of BP's negligence by arguing that in both instances the pipes had frozen and BP ignored the signs of rupturing and leaking in order to cut costs. The pipe had been partially or fully frozen for at least six months before <a href="http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/judge-rules-bps-2009-oil-spill-alaska-was-accidental">the expanding ice caused it to rupture</a> [<em>Alaska Dispatch</em> report]. Judge Ralph Beistline dismissed this argument stating that the 2009 spill was a result of a unique alignment of circumstances and that BP <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/us-judge-rejects-attempt-to-revoke-bps-probation-for-oil-spill-lifts-companys-restrictions/2011/12/27/gIQABHh9KP_story.html">adhered to accepted industry practices</a> [WP report] and reasonably addressed the situation. Beistline also dismissed prosecutors' claim that the migration of the oil into US waters was a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/ch26.html">Clean Water Act</a> [33 USC &#167; 1251 <em>et seq.</em> text]. The decision is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/27/us-bp-alaska-idUSTRE7BQ1BQ20111227">victory for the oil company</a> [Reuters report] struggling to recover its image after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>].  

<p>Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP, as evidence of the oil giant's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come to light. In November, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bp-reparations-lawsuit-remanded-to-mississippi-state-court.php">remanded a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by the Mississippi attorney general against the administrator of the BP $20 billion Deepwater Horizons reparations fund. In July, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana dismissed consolidated <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-dismisses-bp-oil-spill-fraud-lawsuit.php">racketeering claims against BP</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the spill brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 <em>et seq.</em> text]. Former Alabama Attorney General Troy King <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August 2010 against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. One month prior, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the DOJ would review whether any <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">criminal or civil laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/HT/Report_on_killings_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] illustrates the context of the state of affairs in which the HNP have been operating, and then focuses on the death of eight people over five cases to detail their mistreatment and alleged unlawful deaths between October 2010 and May 2011. The report goes on to present what it sees as patterns of behavior found in the cases including police justifications of crossfire, lack of investigation by prosecutors, and procedural delays of investigations by judges. The report also notes that to date, no police officers have been held responsible for the deaths detailed by the report. The report recommends:<blockquote>actions to ensure that justice is rendered in each of these five cases and also recommends that the authorities as well as the international community take additional steps to support the many officers of the HNP who are trying to fulfill their duties to ensure that the police is a respected institution, having the trust of the Haitian  people; an institution that is fully capable of fulfilling its responsibilities that are essential for the country's future.</blockquote>The second <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/HT/Report_on_Torture_Fr.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in French] details the specific case of the alleged torture and murder of Serge Demosthene in June 2011. The report questioned "the Haitian authorities, compliance with the right to life, the right to be free from torture, and norms governing arrest, as well as respect for judicial independence."

<p>In July, the OHCHR spoke on the importance of <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-urges-haiti-to-improve-rights-try-duvalier.php">Haiti improving its human rights record</a> [JURIST report], including trying ex-president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/231156.stm">Jean-Claude Duvalier</a> [BBC backgrounder].

Lawyers for the victims argued that they were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/10/2011103011331929580.html">not given enough time</a> [Al Jazeera report] to question Field Marshal <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/tantawi.htm">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], head of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder] currently ruling Egypt. In December, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-rejects-request-for-new-judge-in-mubarak-trial.php">court rejected the motion</a> and fined the prosecution for making the request. Mubarak is facing charges of complicity in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">deaths of more than 800 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] that resulted in Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">stepping down in February</a> [JURIST report]. The trial lasted a few hours on Wednesday and is due to resume again on January 2. 

<p>The trial for ex-president Mubarak has been tumultuous. In September, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-resumed-amid-courtroom-violence.php">violence broke out in the courtroom</a> when plaintiffs and their lawyers clashed with Mubarak supporters. In August, presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-resumes-live-tv-broadcasts-to-end.php">decided to end live TV broadcasts</a> [JURIST report] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts.

The new rules would require all correspondence to the five detainees to undergo a security review by officials from law enforcement and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website]. Woods has not yet signed the proposed rule change, but it was sent to lawyers for the prisoners with an order for them to sign and agree to the change. Lawyers for the prisoners responded to the proposed rule with a written memo stating that they did not agree to the rule because it violates attorney-client privilege and would erode their clients' right to counsel that is afforded by the US <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.txt">Constitution</a> [text] and asked for more time to review the rule. The detainees, whose arraignment is anticipated to occur in 2012, include <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>].

<p>Lawyers for detainees at Guantanamo have raised concerns previously with practices used at the prison. In November, lawyers complained specifically about the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-lawyers-charged-with-defending.php">infringement on attorney-client privilege</a> [JURIST report] in a letter directed to the attention of the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs. The attorneys alleged that those working with the Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO) seize, open, interpret, read and review attorney-client privileged communications, actions which the attorneys argued are unlawful. The five detainees have been held at Guantanamo since 2006 when they were transferred there from the custody of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In April, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">announced that the trials</a> [JURIST report] for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four other detainees are set to be held before a military commission. This was a change from Holder's previous position to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">conduct the trials in federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perez, et al.</span>, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/US-amicus-Tx-redistricting.pdf">pressed</a> [brief, PDF] the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday to reject a redistricting map drawn by the Texas legislature which was not cleared pursuant to Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In its stead, the administration argued, the interim map drawn up by a three-judge panel from the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] should be used:<blockquote>[Texas] argues that there is no time for a remand and this Court therefore should designate the unprecleared maps as the interim maps [for the 2012 election]. Insofar as this Court is required to choose between either the State's unprecleared plans or the interim plans drawn below, it should select the latter. Even if the court-drawn plans may&#8212;pending further explanation&#8212;insufficiently adhere to state redistricting principles in certain respects, those plans are preferable to ones whose very use would contravene Section 5's preclearance regime and whose content violates Section 5 in purpose and effect.</blockquote>The Obama administration opposes the state's map for the state house and for the state's congressional delegation in the US House of Representatives, but not the state senate map, even though minority groups are opposing all three maps. Oral argument for all three redistricting plans is set for January 9.

<p>Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">agreed to rule</a> [JURIST report] on the three Texas redistricting plans as part of an emergency appeal by Texas. According to the 2010 census, Texas' population grew by 4.3 million, which gave it four more seats in the US House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the congressional districts in a way that challengers claim would make it more likely for Republicans to win those new seats. The plan must be approved by either the Justice Department or a federal court under the VRA, and the Obama administration has objected to the plan. In the meantime, the federal court in Texas drew an "interim map" for use in the 2012 election. The interim map is the map currently being challenged before the Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The second complaint alleges that Arroyo approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company <a href="http://wwwen.zte.com.cn/en/">ZTE Corporation</a> [corporate website] in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008. Arroyo abandoned the deal in 2008 as a result of public pressure. Prosecutors also charged Arroyo's husband Jose Miguel Arroyo, the former Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza and former Commission on Elections Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. on related charges. The former president is accused of violating sections 3 (g) and (i) of the <a href="http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1960/ra_3019_1960.html">Republic Act 3019</a> [text], as well as the <a href="http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6713_1989.html">Republic Act 6713</a> [text], also known as the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. Arroyo and her husband reject the accusations.

<p>Arroyo was formally charged last month with corruption and election fraud during her presidency and was arrested the next day on a warrant issued for the charges. Earlier that same week, Arroyo and her husband tried to leave the country after the Philippine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">allowed them to travel</a> [JURIST report] despite the pending charges, but were denied transit until they received an official copy of the court order. The arrest warrant effectively overrides the court's travel permit. In July 2010, current Philippine president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile] signed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Twenty pages of the 90-page report <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hX2aeBtA2-7hWGvathOM5Ec4xK6g?docId=11ffe3fb3ed24bb4be75ba4e8a98199e">focus on the United States</a> [AP report], and list a number of practices and conditions that the MFA views as violations of basic human rights. Among the concerns raised were alleged invasions of personal privacy, purported mistreatment of Muslim Americans since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 terror attacks</a> [JURIST Feature] and judicial errors which have permitted innocent people to be convicted of capital crimes. The MFA report also highlights the "notorious" military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] and rebukes US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/barackobama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] for "legalizing indefinite and extrajudicial custody" of those prisoners. The report also criticizes Canada, European Union nations, and some former Soviet states. It excludes the Middle East and Asia. Some of the MFA report's concerns surrounding <a href="/hotline/2010/04/continued-support-for-capital.php">capital punishment</a> and the <a href="/hotline/2011/11/wells-dixon-guantanamo-dysfunction.php">Guantanamo Bay prison</a> [JURIST op-eds] have been voiced by JURIST contributors.

<p>This report marks the first time that the MFA has issued a statement regarding the state of affairs of human rights in other countries, although Russia has been criticized internationally and by its own citizens for its human rights record. Earlier this month, the Russia Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-rights-council-condemns-khodorkovsky-conviction.php">called for the annulment</a> [JURIST report] of the conviction of ex-oil tycoon <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mikhail+Khodorkovsky">news archive</a>]. Also this month, Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] ordered an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/russia-president-orders-probe-into-election-fraud-allegations.php">investigation into allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] in recent parliamentary elections. Earlier, the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] issued <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/international-election-fraud-monitor-concerned-about-russia-election-process.php">preliminary findings</a> [JURIST report] that the Russian election was "characterized by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation." The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] and other world leaders have also called for an investigation into the allegations of election fraud and expressed concern over "harassment" of election monitoring groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum would be held on November 6, 2012.  The first part of the referendum asks whether <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/3593469.stm">Puerto Rico</a> [BBC backgrounder] should change its status at all. The second part of the referendum asks which type of status change is preferred, including statehood, independence or "sovereign commonwealth" outside the Territorial Clause of the US Constitution. Fortuno praised the two-part referendum:<blockquote>[I]n a single event, we know with clarity, first, if our people want to maintain the current territorial political status and second, we know which of the alternatives of Puerto Rico's territorial status has more support from Puerto Ricans to provide the people.</blockquote>The results of the referendum would not be binding to the US because congressional action would be required to enact any status change.

<p>The Puerto Rican House of Representatives voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/puerto-rico-to-hold-status-referendum.php">pass the legislation</a> [JURIST report] to permit the referendum earlier this month. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-us-house-passes-bill-on-puerto-rico-status-referendum.php">approved a bill to establish the referendum</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010, but it was never approved by the Senate. In 2007, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/special_committee_main.htm">Special Committee on Decolonization</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/gacol3160.doc.htm">called on the US</a> [press release] to quickly resolve the island's political status and release political prisoners. Puerto Ricans last voted on the status of the island in <a href="http://electionspuertorico.org/1998/summary.html">1998</a> [results], with the "None of the Above" option winning 50.3 percent, statehood garnering 46.5 percent of the vote and independence only 2.5 percent. The island was established as a US commonwealth in 1952 after Congress adopted the Puerto Rican Constitution. Puerto Ricans have been US citizens since 1917, and the island has been under US control since 1898. JURIST Managing Editor Dwyer Arce recently argued that, as US citizens, Puerto Ricans <a href="/dateline/2011/12/dwyer-arce-popular-vote.php">should be entitled to vote</a> [JURIST op-ed] in US presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lying on a stretcher and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-housing-activist-is-latest-dissident-put-on-trial-in-sweeping-government-crackdown/2011/12/29/gIQAzxxqNP_story.html">relying on an oxygen machine</a> [AP report], Ni pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud for falsifying facts to steal property and inciting a disturbance when they were detained by police in April. Although a court spokesperson indicated the trial was open to the public, foreign journalists and diplomats were <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/274167/20111229/ni-yulan-goes-trial-third-chinese-activist.htm">barred from the proceedings</a> [<em>International Business Times</em> report]. Ni, a trained lawyer, and her husband have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/29/chinese-rights-activist-fraud-trial?newsfeed=true">assisted victims of government land seizures</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] including those displaced by the Beijing Olympics project. Ni's lawyer, Cheng Hai, indicated the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8982710/Chinese-daughter-of-jailed-activists-pleas-for-Britains-help.html">hearing was interrupted for unclear reasons</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] after only four hours and without producing a verdict as expected. It is unclear when a verdict will be announced. 

<p>Ni Yulan is the third high-profile dissident to be put on trial in recent weeks as part of a larger crackdown timed around Christmas in order to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8978021/China-continues-Christmas-crackdown-on-activists-as-Chen-Xi-given-10-years-in-prison.html">avoid international scrutiny</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Earlier this week, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-setences-dissident-to-10-years-in-prison.php">sentenced political activist Chen Xi</a> [JURIST report] to 10 years in prison for inciting subversion.The charges against Chen, 57, stemmed from more than 30 political essays that he had published online. Last week, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-sentences-dissident-to-nine-years-in-prison.php">sentenced human rights advocate Chen Wei</a> [JURIST report], who is unrelated to Chen Xi, to nine years in prison. Chen Wei, 42, was sentenced after a two-hour hearing in which he pleaded not guilty to inciting subversion of state power. He was charged for having written essays critical of the Communist Party, which he published on overseas Chinese websites, avoiding the national Internet censorship firewalls. Chen was one of more than 130 activists detained after the US-based news site <a href="http://boxun.com/">Boxun</a> [website, in Chinese] reported an anonymous appeal for people to stage protests across China last February. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Yazdi was also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMpJ4SbBS6J2LJ_2Ryi8U_Z04Mlg?docId=CNG.06a44a72312245ca56b70cd6c2af023f.161">banned from civic activities for five years</a> [AFP report] in the closed-door trial reportedly held in early November. Yazdi, now 80 and suffering from cancer and a heart ailment, is head of the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/parties/nehzateazadi/">Freedom Movement of Iran</a> [Princeton University backgrounder], which was instrumental in the 1979 Islamic revolution but was subsequently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/iran-dissident-leader-sentenced-to-8-years-in-prison-for-acts-against-national-security/2011/12/28/gIQADxpeMP_story.html">banned after it turned against clerics and advocated democratic reform</a> [AP report]. According to his lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, Yazdi <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1683026.php/Former-Iranian-foreign-minister-sentenced-to-eight-year-jail-term">refused to defend himself</a> [DPA report] after questioning the legitimacy and jurisdiction of the court. Yazdi's lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, in July was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/iran-rights-lawyer-jailed-for-government-overthrow.php">sentenced to nine years in prison and banned from working as a lawyer</a> [JURIST report] and a teacher for ten years after being convicted of seeking to overthrow the government. Yazdi plans to appeal and hopes for an appeals court that will allow a public trial with a jury.

<p>Yazdi is one of several opposition figures that have been detained and charged in connection with a wave of civil unrest following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">disputed re-election</a> [JURIST news archive] of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10866448">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile, <a href="http://www.president.ir/en/">official website</a>].

The upper house met in an extended session of parliament intended to allow for passage of the Lokpal bill, but <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h-zvnHWqZe4G4hjNXxBf0131CsRQ?docId=CNG.b52f63e2c662e52abfaf62142eea6427.6f1">adjourned at midnight after 14 hours of acrimonious debate</a> [AFP report]. The bill was torpedoed by a ruling-coalition party member, the Trinamool Congress, in an abrupt reversal. Opposition parties have <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Anti-Corruption-Measure-Stalls-in-India-136425778.html">accused the government of deliberately avoiding a vote</a> [VOA report] because it lacked the votes. The future of the bill is unsure. Parliament is <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57350033/india-anti-corruption-law-doesnt-clear-parliament/">scheduled to reconvene early next year</a> [AP report], but the date is unclear. Anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare has criticized the Lokpal bill, demanding a more powerful ombudsman while the opposition demanded independent investigatory powers. 

<p>Corruption has been a major issue recently in Indian politics. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a> [official website], the Indian lower house of parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/india-lower-house-of-parliament-passes-controversial-anti-corruption-bill.php">passed the Lokpal bill</a> [JURIST report]. The bill was proposed in response to many corruption scandals that have occurred in India recently including a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/india-upper-house-of-parliament-impeaches-high-court-judge.php">high court judge embezzling funds</a> [JURIST report]. Also, Indian activist Anna Hazare's twelve day fast in August prompted the Indian government to address the issue of corruption. Earlier this month, the Transparency Index (TI) released its Corruptions Perceptions Index in which it named <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/183-countries-ranked-in-annual-corruption-index.php">India as one of the countries whose corruption perception had deteriorated</a> [JURIST report] since last year. In August, addressing both houses of parliament, Indian president Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil indicated that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-president-government-to-address-corruption.php">Indian government would work to eradicate corruption</a> [JURIST report] and take measures to ratify the UN Convention Against Corruption and that it will take other legislative and administrative measures necessary to improve transparency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani and Pakistani <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4032997.stm">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile] have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations.

The army denies planning a coup and supports the court's involvement to sort out what happened and where the memo came from.

<p>Since controversy arose over the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killing of Osama Bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] by US forces in Pakistan in May, Pakistan's alliance with the US has been questioned.

The new policy will give illegal immigrants who have resided in Poland since December 2007 or longer to apply for residence. Residents who have been denied legal status in the past and ordered deported will have to show they have been in the country without leaving since at least January 1, 2010. Those who are approved will be granted amnesty for two years, during which time they can enter into employment contracts and work to legitimize their stay for longer. The law was passed by the Polish Sejm in July and <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/poland-government.bvp">signed</a> [EUBusiness report] by President Bronislaw Komorowski in August. This is the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15512591,00.html">third amnesty law</a> [DW-World report] of its kind Poland has passed, including one in 2003 and one in 2007. Officials believe this law will be more successful because there are fewer restrictions than in the previous laws.

<p>Amnesty for illegal immigrants continues to be a controversial international issues. In August, US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/us-to-review-deportations-in-300000-immigration-cases.php">major reforms</a> [JURIST report] to the US's current immigration system, putting 300,000 illegal immigrants' cases up for review and temporarily halting their deportation. Many of the criteria allowing immigrants to stay in this country mirror portions of the US <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3992:#">Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act</a> [materials], which has languished in Congress for a decade, and attempts to provide amnesty for illegal immigrants who serve in the military or achieve a college education. Both <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/france-grants-amnesty-to-7000.php">France</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/spain-amnesty-blamed-for-encouraging.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports] have granted amnesty at times, to varying results. Spain was criticized, as EU commissioner complained that its amnesty program contributed to an uptick in illegal immigration between Africa and Europe. The UK <a href = "/paperchase/2006/07/uk-government-rejects-amnesty-for.php">rejected an amnesty program</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, and instead focused on a "fair but tough" enforcement of immigration law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/50C36.txt">Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 2008</a> (FISA) [text] provides in Section 802 that "a civil action may not lie or be maintained . . . against any person for providing assistance to an element of the intelligence community" as long as the Attorney General certifies this fact while it is still in district court. In an appeal of a dismissal under this section challenging the provision as unconstitutional, a three-judge panel of appeals judges affirmed the dismissal, saying the section "does not violate Articles I or II of the Constitution or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment." The same court also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/appeals-court-oks-law-giving-telecom-companies-immunity-for-governments-surveillance-program/2011/12/30/gIQAbJt0PP_story.html">reinstated two other lawsuits</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] brought by telecommunications customers seeking redress for alleged violations of privacy by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/index.shtml">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website].

<p>The appeal consolidated 33 cases brought since 2006 challenging immunity for the companies as unconstitutional. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/house-passes-fisa-amendment-granting.php">passed amendments to FISA</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 that included a controversial provision granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive]. The original suits were brought in response to reports that the NSA was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/nsa-data-mining-us-telecom-info-in.php">using data gathered from warrantless searches</a> [JURIST report] by American telecommunications companies to identify people with connections to terrorism. The US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/fisa/FISCR_opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in 2002 that warrantless wiretapping surveillance was constitutional after an order by former US President George W.

The law was challenged by <a href="http://www.family-pac.com/">Family PAC</a> [official website] on three grounds, including two that require political action committees to report on the identities and occupations of contributors. Only the three-week time limitation was found to be an unconstitutional violation of the right to free speech under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text]. Washington <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/">Attorney General Robert McKenna</a> [official website] argued the law was designed to protect citizens who take advantage of a widely used vote-by-mail system, in which voters mail in their ballots 18 days before the election. The court, however, said a 21-day ban on accepting donations is not "narrowly tailored" to suit the governmental interest in "informing the electorate." The court also concluded that, "The fact that voters have access to ballots earlier than before, and that they may choose to vote before all the election debate is in fact over, is not a sufficient reason to save this statute."

<p>Washington has been involved in multiple lawsuits involving elections this year. In November, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the names of signers of a petition to abolish a domestic partnership law <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/appeals-court-allows-release-of-referendum-71-petition-names.php">could be released</a> [JURIST report] because it was not a violation of the First Amendment or unreasonably dangerous to do so. A US district court also ruled in January on the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-rules-washington-primary-election-system-constitutional.php">constitutionality of Washington's primary election system</a> [JURIST report]. The court held that the system was constitutional because it would not confuse a reasonable voter, as plaintiffs said it would.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the case, <span class="casename">Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Montana</span>, the high court affirmed a century-old ban on corporate spending, implemented by the <a href="http://peoplespowerleague.info/about/about.htm">1912 Corrupt Practices Act</a> [PPL backgrounder]. The high court concluded that corporations have numerous avenues for voicing their political views, despite the ban on independent expenditures. Specifically, the law allows corporations to set up Political Action Committees (PACs) fund political speech:<blockquote>Corporations, through their political committees organized under Montana law, are and have been a substantial presence and active participants in Montana politics ... The many lobbyists and political committees who participate in each session of the Montana Legislature bear witness. Under the undisputed facts here, the political committee is an easily implemented and effective alternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in political speech.</blockquote> A main difference between corporate independent expenditures and PACs is that, under Montana state law, PACs are subject to special disclosure and reporting laws. Two judges dissented from the majority, <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/national/mt-court-restores-corporate-campaign-spending-ban/article_a73ceb3d-fd0c-5802-999a-e748a74b6662.html">arguing</a> [AP report] that the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] declares that a state cannot impose a complete ban on corporate spending. The dissent predicts that if the Supreme Court hears this case, it will overturn the Montana high court's decision. 

<p><a href="/currentawareness/campaignfinance.php">Campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a hotly contested issue recently. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-campaign-finance-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Wisconsin law that prohibited people from donating more than $10,000 per year to political action committees. In June, the US Supreme Court ruled that an Arizona campaign finance regulation <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota law that prohibited direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. The <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] ruled in 2009 that a Connecticut campaign finance law <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-rules-connecticut.php">discriminated against minor party candidates</a> [JURIST report] in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

Egyptian officials <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16370561">assured the US</a> [BBC report] that it would return all property and assets seized in the raids to the NGOs. Despite Egypt's assurances, however, the US said that the raids on NGOs did not positively reflect the Egyptian government's commitment to democracy. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2011/12/179774.htm#EGYPT">expressed her concern</a> [press briefing] over Egypt's approach toward the NGOs:<blockquote>We believe that these NGOs are there to support the democratic process. Some of these are institutions that are supported by the United States Government, that work around the world in the interests of helping citizens realize their goals of democratic processes taking root in their country ... So we are very concerned, because [raids are] not appropriate in the current environment.</blockquote>The raids resulted from concerns by the Egyptian government over how the pro-democracy NGOs were funded. Egypt's military proclaimed that it would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-egypt-groups-idUSTRE7BS0PT20111229">not tolerate foreign interference</a> [Reuters report] in the nation's affairs. The US hinted that the raids may induce increased scrutiny over the $1.3 billion in military aid that the US sends to Egypt annually.

<p>Egyptian crackdowns against protesters have drawn significant criticism recently. On Thursday, Egyptian prosecutors and police raided the offices of 17 pro-democracy groups. Two weeks ago, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-egypt-military-crackdown.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a brutal suppression of protesters that led to 11 deaths and over 500 injuries. In late November, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-egypt-violence.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into violent skirmishes between protesters and government forces. Earlier in November, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-report-egypt-military-rulers-abused-protesters-violated-human-rights.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] chastising the Egyptian government for using unwarranted violence in discouraging political dissent. Shortly before AI released its report, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] and a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-experts-urge-restraint-in-egypt.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to protect human rights and civil liberties following a bloody clash between police forces and approximately 50,000 protesters in Tahrir Square in Egypt. </p>]]></content:encoded>
